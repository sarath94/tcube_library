00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,632
What is a router nothing but syntax analyser

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,656
Who is this

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Thanks analysis

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448
Face

00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
Possessive basically of tortoise

8
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,896
One stop dumb person and other is bottom up parser

9
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,712
Antop does fossils oregon of 2 test

10
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
Coming to this point

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,808
Where is text books are various convention

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
And they follow various method

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,464
And i am following this may be in that book by aho ullman ravi shetty in the car

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488

00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,512
Dragon book

16
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,864
Adipoli defend convention you can follow anything but then i am following this

Photo

18
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,728
Top ten percent of 2 types one is top down parser with full backtracking

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
Amitabh done faster without full backtracking

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
So what is in the back cracking hills

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
We tried to go and analyse all possibilities

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
And if any of the possibilities 0

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
Again we go back and suzanne

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,112
And top down parsing without backtracking is

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,648
We are going to generate this tree

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
Exactly that is required

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
And bottom of pastors

28
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560
What about passes oregano to tell

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
When is operator precedence

30
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
Faster and other

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Lr passes

32
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,216
What are the particle also called as sr pastors

33
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Sr means

Swift review

35
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
What is shifted

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
If user

37
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Is the spark

38
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Journey shift

39
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
What is pushing

40
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
Adventures

41
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
And there is operator filters for

42
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Vishal

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
Talk about it

44
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
And nurses

45
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
And why it is called a lot faster tell me

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
We're scanning the spring

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
From left to right

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
Hello means

49
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Vro

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,144
We are using the rivers of rightmost derivation

51
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
Main purpose of this quote type

52
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
And stop the process without back

53
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Backtracking

54
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
When is call recursive descent

55
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
The name vikas a decent is given because we are

56
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,224
We are going to write recursive function for every

57
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Production

58
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
And the other is called non recursive descent

59
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Whatever it is this

60
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Cellone

61
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,768
This too fast service if you have to construct them domain the top and purses without back cracking

62
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
First of all

63
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
Grammar should not have left recursion

64
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,240
Why not to construct this class of faster grammar should not have left recursion

65
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
And then the grammar should not have

66
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Any kind of

67
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
Non determinism

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
Notre dame instagramers or not allowed

69
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
L and left recursive ramazan not allowed if you

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,088
If you find any grammar which is having left recursion airtel ignited and

71
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,928
And if you find any grammar which is having non determinism we have to laugh factory

72
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
So then

73
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Any person who constructed

74
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
You should not use any

75
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Ambiguous grammar

76
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:49,728
Therefore ambiguous grammar for not allowed for any of these forces except one faster

77
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Operator freezes faster

78
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
Operator precedence parser is the only person which

79
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Even

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Aap

81
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Power

82
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Abaqus rama

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
I'll tell you what is the basic difference between top 10 pass and bottom up parser

84
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
By taking an example

85
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
Alexis example of the grammar and see what is the difference between toward and pass and bottom up parser

86
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,912
Any person's domain domain news of any password is given

87
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
Given any string and given any grammar it

88
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
Just to check

89
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,312
Whether the string can be generated from this grammar

90
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
By using a park street

91
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
If you could construct a parse tree

92
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,992
By using this grammar to generate this train we can say that yes the string is

93
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Incinerated

94
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,832
I know there are two ways in which we can construct a parse tree

95
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
1 ways i could start from the

96
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
All star

97
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,488
Sorting distort symbol and i could generate it like this

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
5 start from the stock symbol

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
And are generated

100
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,192
Now the main decision is that every point what is the production i should choose

101
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
Let us c

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,616
At this point there is no confusion only only way of a have is used in production

103
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,736
Now at this point i could either use this production of this production that is the choice i had to make

104
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
Ok so i am making the choice of snow

105
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
The first one

106
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Choosing the first production

107
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
And then

108
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Yeah is going to be

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Fb is going to be

110
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
So this is what we did it

111
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,215
5 started from the start service taught symbol and it every. i am making a decision about

112
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,847
What is the next production i should be using which means whether i should use this production on this production

113
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
Therefore the main decision coming too

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Top down approach

115
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,527
Stop and approaches starting from the start and going to the

116
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,879
A basic disc terminals domain decisions that we have to make is

117
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
At every point

118
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
At any point if i have to production which one to choose if i

119
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
If i could make the decisions it is science

120
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Therefore the

121
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Main decision making is

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,959
What is the production i should choose for a variable right

123
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
That is why that is why we need to be very deterministic in this

124
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
Next one is bottom up passing water

125
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
What a person

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,967
I'll go i'll take the terminals and then i'll go to the root for

127
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
For example in the world is

128
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Yeah

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Beeg

130
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Pc

131
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
See if this is the word

132
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,207
I will start from the terminals and then i reach the top

133
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,071
So what is the terminal a b b c d right so initially i am going to

134
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Convert this to

135
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Me too

136
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
And then i am going to convert this to

137
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Fb

138
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
T2

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
This is a production i am using

140
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
London i am going to convert

141
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Yeah

142
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Hd

143
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
And i am going to convert a

144
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
A b

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
This

146
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Santa thing to

147
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
Therefore if you see the way i built it i started from the terminals

148
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
Ring and then i would reach the top

149
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Restart symbol

150
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
That is what is called bottom up parser

151
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,407
Now coming to the water of parsis the main decision i might have to make his if i see anything else

152
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Went to redhills

153
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
What to use

154
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
If i have more than one alternative for a production

155
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Which alternator should i use
