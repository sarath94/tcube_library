                Database Management System (DBMS)

             DBMS contains information about a particular enterprise
                       Collection of interrelated data
                       Set of programs to access the data
                       An environment that is both convenient and efficient to use
             Database Applications:
                       Airlines: reservations, schedules
                       Universities: registration, grades
                       Sales: customers, products, purchases, order tracking
                       Employee records, salaries,
                       …..
             Databases touch all aspects of our lives

                              University Database Example
             Application program examples
                       Add new students, instructors, and courses
                       Register students for courses, and generate class rosters
                       Assign grades to students, compute grade point averages
                        (GPA) and generate transcripts
                       Clicker data: record attendance and quiz answers
                           Quiz         Q1: Click 1 now!
             In the early days, database applications were built directly on
                  top of file systems

                            Purpose of Database Systems
              Drawbacks of using file systems to store data:
                        Data redundancy and inconsistency
                           Multiple   file formats, duplication of information in
                              different files
                        Difficulty in accessing data
                           Need         to write a new program to carry out each new task
                        Data isolation — multiple files and formats
                        Integrity problems
                           Integrity  constraints (e.g. “dept_name of student must
                              be a valid department name”) become “buried” in
                              program code rather than being stated explicitly
                           Hard         to add new constraints or change existing ones

                  Purpose of Database Systems (Cont.)
          Drawbacks of using file systems (cont.)
              Atomicity of updates
                
                Failures may leave database in an inconsistent state with
                 partial updates carried out
                Example: Transfer of funds from one account to another
                 should either complete or not happen at all
             Concurrent access by multiple users
                Concurrent accessed needed for performance

                Uncontrolled concurrent accesses can lead to inconsistencies
                  – Example: Two people reading a balance (say 100) and
                    updating it by withdrawing money (say 50 each) at the
                    same time
             Security problems
                Hard to provide user access to some, but not all, data

          Database systems offer solutions to all the above problems

                                         Instances and Schemas
             Similar to types and variables in programming languages
             Schema – the logical structure of the database
                       Analogous to type information of a variable in a program
                       Physical schema: database design at the physical level
                             E.g. data storage structures, indices for fast access
                       Logical schema: database design at the logical level
             Instance – the actual content of the database at a particular point in
                  time
                       Analogous to the value of a variable
             Physical Data Independence – the ability to modify the physical
                  schema without changing the logical schema
                       Applications depend on the logical schema

                                         Data Models
              A collection of tools for describing
                        Data
                        Data relationships
                        Data semantics
                        Data constraints
              Relational model
              Entity-Relationship data model (mainly for database design)
              Object-based data models (Object-oriented and Object-
                   relational)
              Semistructured data model (XML)
              Other older models:
                        Network model
                        Hierarchical model

                                         Relational Model
             Relational model (Chapter 2)
                                                                 Columns
             Example of tabular data in the relational model



                                                                              Rows

                     Data Manipulation Language (DML)
             Language for accessing and manipulating the data organized
                  by the appropriate data model
                       DML also known as query language
             Two classes of languages
                       Procedural – user specifies what data is required and how
                        to get those data
                       Declarative (nonprocedural) – user specifies what data is
                        required without specifying how to get those data
             SQL is the most widely used query language

                       Data Definition Language (DDL)
             Specification notation for defining the database schema
                    Example:create table instructor (
                                    ID           char(5),
                                    name         varchar(20),
                                    dept_name varchar(20),
                                    salary        numeric(8,2))
             DDL compiler generates a set of tables
             Data dictionary contains metadata (i.e., data about data)
                Database schema
                   Which tables are present, what are their attributes, …

                Integrity constraints
                   Which attributes are primary keys, foreign keys, …

                                         Database Design
        The process of designing the general structure of the database:


         Logical Design – Deciding on the database schema. Database
              design requires that we find a “good” collection of relation schemas.
                   Business decision – What attributes should we record in the
                    database?
                   Computer Science decision – What relation schemas should we
                    have and how should the attributes be distributed among the
                    various relation schemas?


         Physical Design – Deciding on the physical layout of the database

                                         Database Design?
             Is there any problem with this design?




         Quiz Q2: The problem is: (1) missing information (2) repeated information
              (3) there is no problem (4) these instructor salaries are too low

                                         Design Approaches
             Normalization Theory (Chapter 8)
                       Formalize what designs are bad, and test for them
             Entity Relationship Model (Chapter 7)
                       Models an enterprise as a collection of entities and relationships
                             Entity: a “thing” or “object” in the enterprise that is
                              distinguishable from other objects
                                – Described by a set of attributes
                             Relationship: an association among several entities
                       Represented diagrammatically by an entity-relationship diagram:
