Preface
-------
     If you do indeed take the
information provided in this art-
icle seriously enough to do it,
please forget where you read it.

Poisons:
--------
     The first and probably least
known way to maime(such a nice word)
someone is through the use of
various herbal extracts..(no I
don't mean Sinsemella)

Diffenbachia (dumbcane)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Take 2-4 of the leaves and boil
them in water (don't inhale the fumes)
When the water becomes a greenish
color, take the leaves and throw
them away..Now take the liquid and
add it to the victims drink,food
etc..The victims voice goes kaput.

Oleander.
=-=-=-=-=
Take a twig of this bush and grind
it into a fine powder..Place the
powder in the salt shaker,or sub-
stitute it for any other type of
seasoning...Causes death within
3-4 hours...sometimes quicker

Poison Oak/Ivy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Take the leaves and do the above
process..Or boil the leaves and
when the water turns brownish/green
pour it out into a vial...Add a few
drops to the victims beverage..
It tends to destroy the victims
vocal cords...

Systemic roses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Take a rose bush and soak the ground
around it with a very poisonous
fertilizer..In the days following
the roses leaves,stems,etc will
become highly deadly..When the
victim gets scratched by it..He/she
dies..

Poisons Part 2
--------------
     The second and more common
poisons are that of deadly metals
and earthy extracts.

Sodium Arsenide.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This along with Lead Arsenide rank
in the top ten of leathal materials
Sodium Arsenide can be aquired at
a glass staining shop..It is placed
int the victims food,etc.

Potassium Cyanide.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This is chemical is contained in
appleseeds..To get it you must
grind up about 12 oz of apple seeds
..The effect is close to radiation
poisoning...It kills within 6 hours

      /
Curare.
=-=-=-=
This substance is basically a bad
poison..It is various poisons
combined into a leathal dosage..It
kills within 45 minutes.

Lead.
=-=-=
Although this material is very common
it is also very deadly..Take about
30-40 grams of lead shavings(dust)
and put them in someones food..
It does wonders....<ack!>

Mercury.
=-=-=-=-
Mercury is a highly deadly material
that kills skin on contact...To use
most effectivly,place about 20 grams
wherever the victim might place
his hand or any other part of his
body for that matter..Or place
it in his food supply...It to does
wonders...<ack!>

Plutonium.
=-=-=-=-=-
This material along with Pulonium,
is <VERY> deadly...It causes cancer
in even the most minute dosages.
If the victim is exposed to it he
will die within a week of radiation
poisoning....<glow in the dark!>

Others (Unknown!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Although it is impossible to list
all of the deadly substances here
I will show how to make contact
poison...

(credit to Ima Hacker)
take 3 no-fly pest strips (tm)
place them in a jar of turpentine
overnight..In the morning scoop out
the white/brown gel at the bottom.

it kills in 60 seconds..Count 'em

(again credit must go to Ima Hacker)

Highway Accidents???
--------------------
     The following section describes
various was to seriously harm
the occupant by destroying the
victims car...

Explosions
=-=-=-=-=-
Take a film canister filled with
liquid drano and drop it into the
gas tank...Do this just before your
target enters his car...When he's
driving down the freeway or any
other part of the HTS his car will
suddenly become engulfed in flame.

Carbon Monoxide (CO)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Drill a small hole into the exhaust
system of the victims car..From it
run a length of tubing into the
passenger compartment..After 20
minutes he will fall onto the floor
and most probably die when he hits
something.

Stuck Accelerator
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Find the victims throttle cable and
cut it..now follow the piece coming
out of the manifold..Now supposing
you found where it intersects the
valve...There should be a small
spring there that keeps the valve
closed...Cut it...push the valve
open....clean up...When Mr. Victim
starts his car the engine will race.
when he shifts he should fly out of
control down the roadway..until
<KERASH>


Other more messy ways
---------------------
     This section is not really what
you would call classic..but i suppose
it'll have to do.

The Chain saw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Don a ski mask and follow your victim.
When he stops and turns around...
Give his limbs a vacation with
your nifty poulan chainsaw.......

The Exploding House.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Take one pound of plastique and a
blasting cap...hook the two wires
of the blasting cap onto your victims
telephone Box..insert the blasting
cap into the plastique..Now place
the plastique underneath the victims
gas meter..Go to a pay phone and dial
his number...when the phone rings

<BAAAARRROOOOOOMM!>
house and all...
