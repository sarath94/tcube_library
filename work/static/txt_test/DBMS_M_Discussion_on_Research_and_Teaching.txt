                     Research
• What is research?
  – “The systematic investigation into and study of
    materials and sources in order to establish facts and
    reach new conclusions.” Oxford English Dict.


• Solve a problem in an innovative way
• Find out a limitation of an existing published
  solution, and extend it
              Find Research Area
• How to find good research areas
  – Browse through research papers from good conferences
    and journals
     • Database Tier 1: ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, IEEE ICDE, EDBT/ICDT
     • Database Tier 2/3: DASFAA, CSI COMAD, various workshops, ..
  – Attend good conferences in India
     • E.g. COMAD conference
  – View online talks
  – Find real world problems that are not solved satisfactorily
     • And abstract them so there is some hope of solving them.
                     Dig Deep ..
• Digging deep is key to research: read lots and
  lots of papers, internalize them
  – Bachelors: Knows nothing about everything
  – PhD: Knows everything about nothing!
• How to learn more about an area
  – Find some interesting papers and read them
     • And read key background material required to understand
       those papers
  – Find courses which have collected interesting papers
    on an area, and read them
     • E.g. papers on query optimization and Big Data covered in CS
       632, Advanced DBMS, IIT Bombay
                And Innovate
• Don’t just accept what you read in a paper
  – Find limitations, find flaws
  – Find cases where the ideas described won’t work well
• Figure out how to extend the ideas, or come up
  with new ways which will work in those cases
• Show your ideas work
  – Implement ideas, do a performance study comparing
    your approach with others
       But Avoid Temptations..
• Plagiarism
• Fake Journals
