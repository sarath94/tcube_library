First off, this is mainly a beginners book to anarchy stuff. This will show
you how to make a type of napalm, flash bombs, a good bomb, and a few other
neat little things. Well I know this may seem basic to some, but it is. Still
I would recommend you get it. Anyway first thing, napalm.

NAPALM: Ok, you know what napalm is I hope, the jelly like substance that
catches on fire and sticks to things. (can be VERY desturctive!)
what you need:
                2 sq. meters of styrofoam
                1 gallon of gas
                4 cups of laundry detergent
                a couple of matches
                A big jar or bowl

First, you need to mix the styrofoam and gas until the styrofoam get "soupy",
then, mix in the detergent. All the while, you need to make sure this is in
a big jar or bowl. After you have combined all ingredients, excluding the
matches, make sure this is kinda like soup or jelly. After you have placed
this on whatever you wanna burn, take a match light it, and get away very
quickly. The only real problem with this recipe is, is that it doesn't stick
very well to things. Oh well....

FLASH BOMB: This is the simplest thing here. you don't need a whole helluva
lot except for gunpowder. This creates a HUGE flash, and a lot of smoke. This
is a great thing to use at night when you need to scare the shit outa someone.
You will need:
                x amount of 3 to 4 inch squares of tin foil
                and about 1 tablespoon of gunpowder for each bomb
                some fuses, fire cracker or you can look at the end of this
                file, I'll show you how to make fuses.

Now, all you need to do is make the piece of foil into a U shape. After you
have done this, take one tablespoon and fill the U up about 3/4 the way.
Then put the fuse in the center, and close up the U. Now, it doesn't need to
be airtight, all you need to do is to close the foil up around the fuse.

A REAL BOMB: This is simple too. This creates a GIGANTIC boom, a good size
flash, and a hulluva lot of smoke. This is great in a metal container or a
glass one. The glass one would be for more like a scare the shit outa someone
bomb. The metal one can be used to blow up about 2-5 mailboxes, It may even
do more, mine only totalled one and put alot of holes in 3 others. Ok here
ya go.
Materials:
                1 3 to 4 inch metal or glass container*
                lotsa gunpowder
                fuse
                Modeling putty or clay
                A damn good hiding place from the shrapnel

*Make sure the bottle has a TIGHT lid, otherwise, you will have a shitty
explosion.
Now you're ready. Get the container, fill it all the way to the top excpet
for a little bit of air on the top for the wick to burn. Drill a hole in the
lid big enough for the wick. Screw the lid on TIGHT and put the wick in, make
sure the wick is about 1/4 inch or more inside the gunpowder. The put the
modeling putty or clay all around the hole, sealing out the air around the
wick. Do the same where the jar lip meets the jar. Light and GET THE FUCK AWAY!

OPTION A: Do all the above, except for a CO2 cartridge full of gasoline or
gunpowder. Make sure you put the wick in the cartridge, and then put putty
around the top of the hole.

OPTION B: You do the same as above, but you use gasoline instead, this
produces a fire in many cases afterwords. Great for mailboxes!

WICKS: This is a pretty good way to make wicks.
Ok here is the stuff:
                piece of string, not yarn (howeverlong you want it)
                gunpowder
                a plate or something flat
                LITTLE bit of water

Here we go, get the string and roll it in the gunpowder, then LIGHTLY wet the
gunpowder, roll the sting in the several times. Make sure you have the string
pretty well coated, but not too much, or else it will burn too quickly.
OPTION A: If you are about to use the wick in a couple of secs, use gasoline
instead of water, gasoline will work better.
OPTION B: Use wax to coat the string first, get it so the wax is not too hot,
but cool enough to roll gunpowder in. Coat the string once again.
