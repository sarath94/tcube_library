IGOR'S LABORATORY, yet another fun filled paradise from the realms of
            The Banana Republic BBS, Auckland, New Zealand
oday's topic: HOME PREPARATION OF NITROGLYCERINE
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISCLAIMER: Despite his enormous and overwhelmingly gigantic intelligence
and wisdom, Crazy Igor is totally helpless when it comes to guarantees,
nd in fact his amazingness says on this matter:
                  "IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, SUCK SHIT!!"
You have been warned......
Today's Topic:  HOME PREPARATION OF NITRIC AND SULPHURIC ACIDS
ntroduction:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
itric and Sulphuric acids are the two key ingredients in the nitration
ess of all common NITRO explosives. Contrary to popular belief,
U DON'T HAVE TO SMASH INTO ICI TO GET THESE CHEMICALS!!
f you want commercial quality acids, look in the yellow pages
under Laboratory Suppliers and you will find one which will sell you
small quantities of these acids (most lab suppliers supply them in
L lots..)
This file does not give any instruction in the preparation of explosive
ompounds and mixtures.... for that info, see my philes ending in EXPlosives
extension, the one applicable to this file is Nitro.EXP
njoy!

ysical Properties:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
l you really need to know about these acids is that they are acids..
Complicated? Well, all you need to know is that they are corrosive,
(VERY corrosive), so don't pour them over your girlfriend's muesli.
Raw Materials Required:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
12v LEAD ACID BATTERY           Easily available
OTTASIUM NITRATE               See Saltpeter.PRP preparation

Step 1:
^^^^
Place two parts of pottasium nitrate in a lab bottle with a one hole stopper
lab glassaware is available from Auckland Glass, Parnell) Place a piece of
glass tubing with with rubber tubing attached to it in the hole. Don't fill
he beaker more the a quarter full of crystals
Step 2:
^^^^^^^
Split open the car battery, trying not to let your hands dissolve too much
n the process. Alternatively, suck out the battery acid with a straw. Boil
his stuff until white fumes start appearing, these fumes are poisonous
o don't sniff them.. This is now pure Sulphuric Acid (easy huh?)
Step 3:
^^^^^^^
lace one part of acid into the bottle. Mix this into a paste with a glass
od

ep 4:
^^^^^
n the rubber tubing through an ice water bath into another open bottle.
Place
                               THE END

 yet another great chemistry lesson with CRAZY IGOR, your favourite
ind of professor....
