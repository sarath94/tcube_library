         Introduction:
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=

             Well here it  is, the path  to true Anarchy.....Are  you
         worthy of the title of a  true Anarchist? We will soon  see.
         The Black  arts are  Theft, Deception,  Destruction and  all
         sub-forms of  Anarchy.  To master  the  techniques  involved
         takes time and  patience but most  of all, it  has to be  in
         your blood! You  can always  tell the  difference between  a
         True Anarchist and  a dabbler....Pulling the  fire alarm  at
         school duzn't cut it  ( Although that can  be phun during  a
         slow day )...Anyone can do that, BUT, can you do it  without
         getting caught? Well, that  is the tough  part. Even at   an
         early age one can see the signs of Anarchy emerge...if a kid
         watches Mister Rogers all  day, forget it  but if he  builds
         crude weapons out of household items and delights in tortur-
         ing the family pet, his sister etc.. then he has  potential.
         Anarchy usually  starts  off small  and  grows over  a  long
         period of time...at first,  primitive forms of Anarchy  such
         as crank calls, nicky nine doors and petty theft will  begin
         the process.  At this  point,  frequent failure  or  getting
         caught may put a stop  to the increasing chaotic  tendencies
         within the  person in  question. If  the little  bastard  is
         successful in his  endeavors, however,  he will  move on  to
         bigger and  better things.  The real  phun stuff  starts  in
         highschool..there are endless possibilities for amusement at
         the expense of others....these will be documented latr.  One
         thing to remember however is  that there are many  obstacles
         which stand in your path such as COPS, locks, alarms and  of
         course, the most important thing  to watch out for is  care-
         lessness on your part. It is becuz of carelessness that many
         good hellraisers have met their fate. Well, enough bullshit,
         let's get started!
         Chapter One: THEFT
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

           Theft is one of the  most common forms of Anarchy,  almost
         everyone  duz it at one point in their lives...Even the Pope
         probably stole dime-store  candies when he  was a  kid...Not
         everyone, however, will  perform this maneuver  to the  same
         extent or with the same  rate of success. The CARELESS  ones
         get eliminated  by the  forces of  good. Regardless  of  the
         motive, the objective is alwayz the same...To acquire at  no
         cost and with minimal effort, items which are not originally
         or rightfully yours...There  are two  sub-classes of  theft.
         These are single party theft and multiple party theft ( with
         accomplish ).....Regardless of the type of theft, there  are
         three important elements  to consider: Planning,  Execution,
         and ESCAPE. The latter is probably the hardest part and must
         be planned  carefully.  A  plan is  alwayz  required  for  a
         successful theft  and should  offer  a high  probability  of
         success with as little risk as possible.



         Part A: Single party theft
         --------------------------

         It is a good idea to make a surveillance sweep of the target
         area beforehand in order to decide on the best route to  the
         desired item and a quick escape route. Alwayz have at  least
         one alternative escape route in case of unexpected interven-
         tion by  cops  or  onlookers which  render  your  first  one
         impassible. Once you have entered  the target area, time  is
         of the  utmost importance...Get  in and  out as  quickly  as
         possible...Be discrete and do not attract attention.  Alwayz
         make a quick scan for mirrors or cameras, try to stay out of
         direct sight  of others.  Sometimes, the  easiest things  to
         take are items which  are kept right in  front of the  cash-
         ier..all it takes is for him to turn his back for one second
         and before you know it...FREE JUNK FOOD! Be alert, if  there
         are other people present, do not go directly to the  desired
         item. Browse a  little, but take  the first reasonably  safe
         opportunity to  make yer  way over  to it.  Pocket the  item
         quickly without looking at  it or fumbling  with it. DO  NOT
         rush out of the  area immediately if you  don't have to,  be
         casual and maybe even make a purchase. If you are confronted
         however, GET  THE FUCK  OUT Take  the quickest  one of  your
         escape routes that you can, if you are perused then you must
         leave a  difficult trail  to  follow. Dodge  on and  out  of
         buildings or cars, backtrack, hop fences or do what ever you
         have to do to lose them. If possible, motorized transport is
         a good idea...( cover the license plate ) If not, then  work
         with what  you have,  create obstacles  as you  go, such  as
         throwing objects at your persuers or knocking things down in
         your wake. Sometimes, a good cop chase can really give you a
         good feeling...It sure satisfies the Rambo in me! If you are
         forced to deviate from your plan due to unexpected interfer-
         ence, follow  your instincts...........but  remember that  a
         true Anarchist duzn't get caught  at the scene! If it  seems
         inevitable that you  will be caught,  stash the goods  some-
         where safe  until you  can collect  it. After  you have  bin
         caught then it's all over..unless,  you lie like a bitch  or
         your captor turns out to be  a friend of the family. If  you
         escape, then you have  successfully completed your  mission.
         Hopefully you will have the phoresight not to hit a store in
         your neighborhood or one that  you go to regularly. Try  not
         to hit the same place every time....that's dangerous! For an
         added challenge, you may want  to try to swipe items  stored
         behind the cashier's counter. There are wayz to do this such
         as the classic "Can I use  yer phone? I'm stranded and  need
         to call home" Heh, if they let you then your only problem is
         how to  distract their  attention. For  this reason,  it  is
         often easier to execute  a successful theft  if you have  an
         accomplish...


         Part B: Multiple party theft
         ----------------------------


           In a multiple  party theft,  the basics are  the same  but
         certain adjustments must be made to yer plan. First you must
         decide who will  do what....One person  has to distract  the
         attention of onlookers while  the other performs the  actual
         crime. You should  have included  a signal in  your plan  so
         that the you can discretely inform  yer buddie that you have
         the goods and it's  time to leave. A  third person may  have
         been posted as a look-out and if so, must also be kept aware
         of what's goin' on. One of  the important tricks is to  make
         it look like you don't know any of yer  accomplishes...don't
         walk in together or leave  together, unless you get  burned.
         If you are confronted, then  it is not alwayz necessary  for
         all the members of yer team to flee if you have successfully
         convinced the teller you are not together. The guy with  the
         goods has to split BUT while the Cashier is chasing him,  or
         callin the cops, what better opportunity will the other  two
         have to fill their pockets? If it becomes necessary for  all
         parties to run, at least you  now have an added benifit  due
         to the fact that if you  split up, it's harder to catch  all
         of you. It is an unwritten  rule that a guy who gets  caught
         can't squeal on the others if there is a chance they can get
         away with it. You should  have a specified rendezvous  point
         and time if you  split up so all  the parties ( minus  those
         who were bagged ) can meet and decide on appropriate actions
         to take to insure no  further problems will arrise. After  a
         few hits with the  same people, you  should have a  kick-ass
         team and will  be able  tackle anything!  One thing  though,
         alwayz watch your back `cuz as Stalin said.."You can't trust
         anyone, not even yourself."


         Part C: Other forms of theft
         ----------------------------

             Well, if yer not into stealin' from convenience  stores,
         there are many available  sources of "low-cost" items,  such
         as cars, houses, purses & wallets and my personal favourite-
         ...school lockers! Cars  are easy...just get  a 1.5 ft  long
         piece of flexible but sturdy  wire (coathanger will do)  and
         bend a loop at  the end to fit  over the lock button.  Slide
         the wire through the gap  between the window and the  middle
         section of the car (not the  top of the window)... Now  loop
         the end around the lock button and pull. For newer cars that
         do not have the lockbutton but have the switch by the  lever
         on the inside door pannel, you need more equipment. You will
         need a flashlight,  a mirror  and a  coathanger. Before  you
         begin, look  through the  opposite window  at the  door  yer
         gonna open and memorize where evrything is positionned. Now,
         tape the  mirror to  the  outside of  that window  with  the
         reflective surface facing into the car. If you have a friend
         helping you, you  don't need  the mirror as  yer friend  can
         stand on the opposite side of  the car and see through  that
         window where you have to move Now slip the coathanger in  as
         above and use the window to bend  it as you insert it so  it
         touches the inside of the  door....using the mirror or  your
         friend to guide yer movements, unlock the door and there you
         go! If you are in a hurry or don't need to worry about noise
         or anything, just throw a brick through the window. Remember
         to search the dashboard,  glove compartment and back  window
         ledge. If you have a  lock pick set and  can use it, go  for
         the trunk to! I'll deal with  locks and picks in a  separate
         issue dealing specifically with  the tools and their  usage.
         Motorcycles are a sinch to swipe. All you need are a pair of
         vice-grips, a screwdriver  and a dime.  Jam the  screwdriver
         into the ignition, clamp the vice-grips to the shaft of  the
         screwdriver and  twist.....  -=SNAP!=- Now  just  press  the
         start button and away you go!  When you've had yer phun  and
         ya wanna ditch  the bike,  drop the dime  into the  ignition
         keyhole and give it a quarter turn to turn off the engine.



            Now, the most risky but often most profitable source is a
         house. Before you even approach the house, fone to make sure
         they're not in. If you don't have their number or they are a
         bunch of rug-pilots who  don't have a  fone, ring the  door-
         bell.....once you have  established the fact  that they  are
         not home, you can decide on  your method of entry. To  break
         into a  house,  Your two  sources  of entry  are  doors  and
         windows. Before I start  describing methods to bypass  locks
         and bolts, remember that  if you think  there is a  security
         system on the  house FORGET  IT and move  on...why risk  it?
         Anywayz, there are many types of door locks and for most you
         will need a lock pick set  which will be dealt with in  vol.
         II. If you have a  lot of time and  are in a deserted  area,
         you can use various power tools to destroy the door  itself.
         Windows are the  harder to  reach but  more simply  bypassed
         entry routes.  There  is  either  a  deadbolt  or  a  simple
         twist/pull lock for both, you just blow a hole in the window
         just above the lock (with a bee-bee gun) or bar and use wire
         or a thin screwdriver  to knock the bar  out or release  the
         lock. Apartment buildings are  also a good target...just  go
         into the front doors and press every intercom button on  the
         pannel. Some deluded  idiot will  let you in.  If not,  wait
         `till a resident comes in and pretend to be fumbling for the
         door key..he will  of course,  open the  door for  you...Heh
         Once you get  in, make sure  no one is  home....then grab  a
         pillow case or a garbage bag and take evrything that is even
         remotely valuable! Once  you have  done that,  cut the  fone
         line and GET THE PHUCK OUT !!! Mission Accomplished....


          NOTE:
          -----
           HITTING HOUSES  IN YOUR  OWN  NEIGHBORHOOD MAY  RESULT  IN
           APREHENSION AND CAN COMPLICATE PREGNANCY....


             LOCKERS!!!! YEAH!! The easiest way to get money or goods
         for nothing. One way is to  write down the serial # and  the
         combination of the lock your  using this year and then  next
         year, find it and voila! In the mean time, you have to  find
         alternate methods to  keep you  busy for a  whole year,  but
         look...there are hundreds  of lockers!  With little  peckers
         you can stand behind  them and simply  watch them enter  the
         combination. If you  want to  hit a locker  belonging to  an
         older student, you have to be covert about it. You might  as
         well start close to home by easily breaking into the lockers
         on either side of yours. This method is simple but  requires
         time and  you will  need a  hex-driver. Look  at the  inside
         pannel of yer locker that forms the wall separating it  from
         the ajacent one. If the heads of the bolts are on your side,
         you will have no problems. Just unscrew the bolts and remove
         the pannel....hmmm...now why didn't you tink of that before?
         Well,  now  you  know.  Most  of  the  schools  supply  spin
         combo-locks that are hard to pick so if all else fails,  use
         those heavy duty metal shears to cut through the shank. Once
         yer in, you are on yer own...... Have phun!

           The last  type of  theft  I will  discuss  is the  art  of
         picking pockets.  This method  is  becomming more  and  more
         difficult    with     the     advent     of     self-defense
         lessons...yes!...even little  Grandma  Johnson  could  be  a
         black belt. Basically all  you have to do  is either run  by
         the victim and snatch it (copyIIpc is optional) heh, or wait
         `til they put it down somewhere where you can whisk it away.
         Once you have the purse or wallet, there are many things you
         can do...  Money!  I'm sure  you  can  all find  a  use  for
         that....Credit Cards!  Now we're  talkin! You  can go  crazy
         ordering and  carding  everything  you desire  (not  to  yer
         house)....You may find a spare key in there to, if so,  look
         at the I.D.  in the wallet  to find out  their  address  and
         away you go! Geez, what a week for the poor sucker eh! First
         his wallet now  his house  and car!!! Heh,  always be  thor-
         ough.....

         NOTE: ALWAYS LEAVE THE SCENE AS YOU FOUND IT SO THE VICTIM
               WILL TAKE LONGER TO NOTICE A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED.
         Chapter Two: DESTRUCTION
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

           Ahhh, there's nothin' like a good hour of destruction
         to  releave all  that tension after  failing yer math  exam.
         Yeah you remember, the one you were supposed to be  studying
         for while you  were mixing  explosives in  the garage.  This
         form of Anarchy  allows for more  creativity than most.  You
         can stck to  doing mild  damage with  yer hands  or you  can
         obtain a wide variety of weapons for more severe effects. It
         is usually easier to  make yer own weapons  and there are  a
         large number  of G-phyles  dealing  with the  production  of
         explosives and simple  weapons. For a  successful strike  on
         your target area, you will need the following:

         o Camouflage (dark clothing, mask)-   To prevent discovery
                                               & Identification

         o A small bat or solid stick/bar  -   To eliminate peo-
                                               ple/dogs who get in
                                               the way & to increase
                                               destructive power

         o A small, "efficient" weapon     -   For serious emergen-
                                               cies only!
                                               (knives or mini-
                                               chucks are good)

         o Flashlight                      -  So you can see what
                                              the phuck yer doin'

         o Several projectiles             -  To increase fire
                                              power and range
                                              ( rocks or anything
                                              will do )

         o Smoke Bombs                     -  A valuable tool,
                                              documented here after

         o FIRE                            -  .......... A  MUST!!!!

         o Explosives                      -  Not compulsary for the
                                              job but they sure
                                              add a spark to the
                                              evening!

         o Spray Paint                     -  To mark out yer

                                              target for theft

                                              yer vandalizing.



             Now, in case you aren't up on the latest "do it yerself"
         weapons info. here are a few of my favourites.....

         Part A: Home-Made Weapons
         -------------------------

         Mini-Chucks
         -----------

            These little  babies  are easy  to  make and  are  easily
         concealable. All you  need are  a pair of  those metal  nut-
         crackers and a 2 foot length  of chain. First, take the  nut
         crackers and cut through the hinge with metal-shears,  being
         sure to leave the rivets intact.  Now open up the last  link
         at each end  of the chain  and close them  around the  rivet
         shaft  on   the   metal   bars.  HEY!   Look   what   you've
         done....little nun-chakaus.

         Tennis Ball Bombs
         -----------------

            This is  a  great idea  I  picked up  from  the  D.O.A.'s
         Anarchy Handbook. Cut a one inch slit in the tennis ball and
         stuff it  full of  wooden match-heads.  (A little  gunpowder
         adds to the effect) Once the ball is fimrly packed, it  will
         detonate on  contact with  a solid  surface pruducing  large
         amounts of flame and flaming projectiles.

         Flaming Darts/ Exploding Darts
         ------------------------------

            Take ordinary darts and wrap  an oil soaked strip of  rag
         around the shaft. Then just light and throw. For an  explod-
         ing dart, tie a cherry bomb  to the shaft using a twist  tie
         and light the fuse.

         Molocov Cocktail
         ----------------

            Fill a Pepsi bottle  half way to  the top with  gasoline,
         insert a rag, light and throw....instant hell fire!



         Part B: Interesting Ideas
         -------------------------

            Try out these nasty thoughts on yer local loser:


         Personalized  Lawns
         -------------------

            Sure! Why not leave yer  initials on the guys lawn  using
         gasoline or  weed-killer? Better  yet,  if yer  artistic,  a
         graphic picture of him pumping the local stray  dog.....heh,
         long-lasting damage!

         Hose Through The Mail Slot
         --------------------------

            Stick the end of the garden hose through the mail slot in
         his door, then crank  the fawset and run  like a fucker!  If
         you do this  at 3am,  his house  will be  floating down  the
         street before he even wakes up.


         Address Switching
         -----------------

            Use yer trusty screwdriver to switch address numbers  and
         steal mailboxes  throughout the  neighborhood. Heh,  if  you
         find the right numbers, you can  make three houses in a  row
         with the same  address, the phun  part is when  you order  a
         party-size pizza to that address. (If you are really on  the
         ball you can rip off the delivery car while Guido is walkin'
         from door to door).



         Part C: The Phun Part
         ---------------------

            Once you have all  yer equipment, yer  ready to go.  Easy
         targets are mail boxes, bird feeders, X-mas lights (when  in
         season) and greenhouses. The weapon you will use most is the
         bat or steel bar you brought along in yer trusty Anarchist's
         bag. Remember to spray  paint the traditional encircled  "A"
         where ever you go to let the world know Anarchy is alive an'
         well. If you posess a slight sadistic streak, domestic  pets
         can make amusing targets. The classic "cemeny shoes" is good
         to drown the neighboors cat in their pool. Fire can be  used
         in countless ways to destroy almost anything. The good  part
         is once you've set the fire,  it will continue to do  damage
         while you are  runnin' to the  next target. The  interesting
         thing is when you  are spotted and chased.  Now you have  to
         use some direct methods to evade capture. Start off mild  by
         simply running. If they persist, create obstacles as you  go
         by knocking things down in  yer wake, jumpin' fences,  cars,
         etc.. If that fails, try a  few smoke bombs lobbed over  yer
         shoulder to block their view....NO! Hmmmm well it's time  to
         get serious because  you smoke  too much to  stay ahead  for
         long. Sooo, use the explosives....that  should do it but  if
         not, just  turn  around, whip  out  the projectiles  or  the
         weapon of yer choice an' just  beat the livin' phuck out  of
         `em. Now  you can  go home,  being sure  to spray  paint  an
         encircled "A" on Mr.  Johnson's bleeding forehead...(heh,  I
         doubt he'll chase you next time)
         Chapter Three: Deception
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

            Well, anyone who  has done anything  similar to the  acts
         described above must  also have  found it  necessary to  lie
         once in a while. Remember that  to get away with lying,  you
         must make the lie seem  like reality. If you convince  your-
         self that it is true then others are more likely to  believe
         you. It's a good idea to  make sure all the people  involved
         in the caper have the exact same story. Alwayz stick to  yer
         story and  never  stray  from it.  Try  to  have  supporting
         evidence on your side too, go for realism! Unfortunately, no
         G-phyle iz gonna turn a lousy liar into a good one...it  has
         to be in yer blood, it does, honest!
         Chapter Four: Sub Anarchy
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

           Aside from the themes outlined above, there are many other
         forms of Anarchial behavior. Some people are specialists  in
         one area like  Pyromaniacs or  Assasins. Others  tend to  be
         less proficient in a wider range of areas. For those of  you
         who are specialists, SPEAK UP! There are many people who are
         hungry  for  material  which  you  could  provide  from  yer
         experiance. Those of you who don't even bother and are  just
         reading thiss phyle for  entertainment.."FUCK OFF!" I  don't
         have time for pussies... I  would suggest that you find  out
         what yer specific  interests are and  persue them.  Whatever
         yer topic is,  there iz a  G-phyle on it  somewhere..believe
         me! If you  are not sure  where yer skills  lie, then  start
         small until you  find them.  I know yer  all probably  sayin
         "C'mon, get on  with it  asshole!" So,  here we  go......the
         final section.
         Chapter Five: The Trials
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


           Now that you have been educated, here iz a little test...

         First:   Aquire $100.00 worth of good from yer local
                  quicky-Mart

         Second:  Do a commamdo-style raid on yer local Jesus Freak
                  settlement

         Next:    Harass the neighbourhood Losers until they move

         Finally: Aquire a "free" Car Stereo and send it to:

           The C.H.A.O.S.S. Agency
            The North Pole
              P/O Box 666

         Include yer address and we'll send'ja a free CHAOSS T-shirt!


         Some of you may be sayin.."HA! You call that a test? I could
         do that in my sleep! Ha Ha"  But for others it is a  reason-
         able challenge.

    Introduction:
   --------------


           Assuming that you have read the first phyle in this series and
    that you are a true Anarchist, I'm sure you will find this phyle both
    interesting and useful.  We have compiled some of the easiest to make
    but most  destructive devices in the Anarchist's arsonal of home-made
    weapons and explosives.  A true Anarchist has a remarkable ability to
    overcome any obstacle using only the materials at his disposal.  I am
    not saying that you need to know 100 diferant ways to kill a man with
    a stapler, just that you should be able to get by using  whatever you
    have. This phyle will show you a few ways to increase  your destruc-
    tive power using simple household items. Remeber that there is a cer-
    tain element of risk involved in handling some of the devices which
    you will see, so please use caution. Neither myself nor anyone asso-
    ciated with the creation of this phyle will take any responsibility
    for damage or injury sustained as a result of attemping any of the
    proceedures depicted hereafter.

     Part One:   Home Made Weapons & Explosives
     ---------  --------------------------------

_____________________________________________________________________________

                              The Motor Mine
_____________________________________________________________________________



    Motor Mine:    This device causes basically the same damage as the
    -----------    "basic mine", but it is more convenient if the intended
                   victim happens to miss stepping on it.


    Materials:     Film Cannister ( or any container )
    ----------
                   Match Books ( 17 fill a Black's film cannister )

                   Wire ( preferably long lengths )

                   Small Electric Motor

                   Battery & Pushbutton Switch


    Method:
    -------

         First, take the lid of your container and make a small hole in it.
    This should be big enough to hold the axle of the motor snuggly.  You
    need to make a small cardboard disk or,  if you can find one,  a small
    plastic gear-like piece meant to fit on an electric motor. You have to
    cover this small disk ( about 1 cm. wide ) with the brimstone from the
    matchbooks. Fill the container with match-heads, push the motor's axle
    through the lid and push the disk onto the axle from the other side.
    Now put on the lid and tape the whole thing up, plus the motor so it
    doesn't wobble around. Hook your wire up to the terminals on the motor
    and then to a switch or a baattery or whatever. Conceal the mother and
    stand back. You will hear a high pitched screach of the motor grinding
    and then BOOM!  Works well.

                                 Time Bomb
_____________________________________________________________________________


         This device isn't too hard to make, but it does have a limitation.
    It doesn't work on the principle that the time you set it to is when it
    goes off, it's more of a mechanical thing....just read.


    Materials:
    ----------

                   o Some sort of container
                   o Wooden Matches ( 17 boxes fill a film cannister but if
                                    you want a bigger bomb, buy about 50 or
                                    so boxes and fill a 2ltr. pop bottle.
                   o Small Electric Motor
                   o Friction Disk ( see previous phyle "motor mine" )
                   o Wire
                   o Battery ( 9 volt should do it )
                   o Cheap Clock with hands
                   o Electrical Tape

    Method:
    -------
                   1) Make the "motor mine" explained above.
                   2) Instead of both leads going straight to the battery,
                      you will have a clock in between, with the faceplate
                      taken off.
                   3) Tie the positive and negative leads to the clock hands
                      and set them to an appropriare distance appart.
                   4) When the hands meet, this will complete the circuit
                      which will start the motor. The Friction disk will spin
                      and rub against the matchheads and KABOOM!!

    Note:  To increase the power of this device, gun powder may be added to
           The match-heads to fill the container.


    Here's a Diagram:                                   __________

         You can see the limitations in the way of time. Basically, all you
    have to make sure of, is that what evr amount of time you want the bomb
    to go off in, the two hands will meet after that amount of time.  There
    might be a way to create a more accurate  timing system using a digital
    clock but that is in theoretical stages only.

                                Napalm Bomb
_____________________________________________________________________________


           Napalm is, in itself a very simple substance.  It can be used for
    in the construction of many simple explosive weapons. Here's a good one:

         Materials:
         ----------     Gasoline            Dishsoap (Joy is good)
                        A Nail              Ammonia Pellets
                        A Drill             Flexible Wire
                        A Coke can

         Procedure:
         ----------

    [1]  First, make a mixture fo 1/2 Dish-soap and 1/2 Gasoline.
    [2]  Cut the top off of the Coke can and fill it with the mixture.
    [3]  Take the drill and put a hole in the ammonia pellet big enough so
         that the nail can fit through it.
    [4]  Put the nail through the pellet and wire it to the top of the can
         so that the nail can be slipped out easily, allowing the pelet to
         drop into the mixture.
    [5]  Attatch some string or fishing line to the nail head and detonate
         from a distance by pulling the string.


     WARNING:   DO NOT LET THAT PELLET FALL INTO THE MIXTURE UNTIL YOU ARE
     SAFE OR YOUR WIFE WILL SOON BECOME A WIDOW ! Wait until you are ready

    Das Crakkerwork:   A neat way to scare the shit out of someone and to
    ----------------   cause moderate amounts of damage.

    Materials:         o A rocket engine (The bigger the better but class
    ----------                            A will do fine)
                       o A fire cracker

                       o Tape

                       o A kick-ass nature

         First, take the engine, it will have one hollow end and the other
    end is filled with the rocket fuel (it resembles clay).  Take a screw-
    driver or something hard and start grinding up the substance from the
    inside.

         Don't grind up the thing totally though. Now put the fire cracker
    inside the engine, witht the fuse sticking out of the convenient hole.
    (The hole is usually used for solar flares).

        Now tape up the son of a bitch so that it's black an' mean looking.

        Finally, light it and throw it, the fire cracker will go off ( but
    won't damage the engine ), then the engine will ignite and go whipping
    around. It makes a lot of ruckus and the exhaust can cause damage.

              2) Pour in some gun powder ( The more, the merrier )
              3) Cut a 6" diameter circle of metal screening and poke a
                 small hole in the center of it.
              4) Place the screen on top of the can and secure it.
              5) Insert a dry fuse or oiled rag through the screen so
                 that it reaches the bottom of the can.
              6) Light the fuse.

    This device will produce extremely large amounts of smoke and flame.

                            How To Make A Fuse
_____________________________________________________________________________



       One reason for which many well made bombs fail is the lack of a good
    fuse. To make a dry fuse, you will need the following:

              o Several sheets of tissue paper (The kind used for machee)
              o Gasoline/Carosine
              o Gunpowder
              o A paint brush
              o Patience

     Method:
    ---------

              1) Use the paint brush to apply a thin film of gasoline on a
                 sheet of tissue paper.
              2) Let dry
              3) Sprinkle a thin line of gunpowder onto the paper
              4) Roll the paper up tightly from one end
              5) Apply a few more layers by repeating steps 1&2 and rolling
                 each new layer around the existing fuse.
              6) Let the whole thing sit for a couple of hours
              7) Apply a final coating of gasoline with the paintbrush
              8) After it is completely dry, it will work beautifully


     Note:
    -------   Experiments are currently being done in an attempt to design
              a fuse which will burn under water.

                         Tennis Ball Grenade
_____________________________________________________________________________


         Most of you have probably heard of the Tennins Ball Bomb. It is a
    handy explosive or noisemaker. The Tennis Ball Grenade is based on the
    same idea but does more damage.


    You will need the following:

         1) A Tennis Ball
         2) A Knife
         3) Several boxes of wooden matches (not safety matches)
         4) Hockey Tape
         5) Gunpowder
         6) A Sparkler
         7) Flint

    Method:
    -------

         1) Cut a small round hole in the ball with the knife
         2) Take the flint (the kind used for flip-top lighters) and crush
            it into a powder
         3) Separate the wire handle from the sparkler and grind it up
         4) Mix the flint and sparkler powder together with gunpowder
         5) Pour the mixture into the tennis ball
         6) Cut off the match-heads and pack the ball with them until you
            can't fit anymore into it.
         7) Use the tape to cover the hole completely
         8) The grenade will explode on contact with any solid surface,
            producing large amounts of flame and flaming projectiles.
         9) [optional] For a delayed blast grenade, insert a dry fuse into
            the hole before you tape it up.

    These babies are easy to make, light weight, conceilable and do plenty
    of damage for their size....in general, a kick-ass weapon. You can make
    dozens of them for hours of enjoyment.

                              The Boom-Box
_____________________________________________________________________________


         The Boom-Box is simple to make and is very effective. It is an anti-
    personnel device and works on one or more victims.


    Materials:
    ----------

              o A metal box with a hinged lid
              o String
              o A mouse trap
              o C-4 or any volatile plastic explosive
              o Tape

    Procedure:
    ----------

              1) Secure the mousetrap to the bottom of the box (inside)
`                with tape.
              2) Tie a piece of string to the trip-bar of the mouse trap
              3) Place a wad of C-4 where the chese would normally go and
                 be sure that the spring loaded bar will hit it
              4) Set the trap
              5) CAREFULLY tape the other end of the string to the inside
                 of the lid so that it is taught when only half open
              6) Close the box
              7) Leave the box somewhere where the intended victim will find
                 it, when he does...he will open it and BOOM!

                               Exploding Pen
_____________________________________________________________________________


         This device is hardly a weapon but it is a mild explosive and will
    serve as a good prank or practical joke. If you wanted to increase the
    power of the explosive, it would not be hard to hard to turn it into a
    destructive device with a few alterations to the construction.


    Materials:
    ----------

              1) A ball point "click" pen
              2) Gun powder
              3) 8-10 wooden match heads
              4) 1 wooden match
              5) A piece of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")


    Procedure:
    ----------

              1) Unscrew pen and remove all parts except for the button at
                 the top of the pen
              2) Stick the match inside the pen where the ink fill was
              3) Roll the sand paper around the match with the rough side
                 facing in so it touches the match head
              4) Put the remaining match heads in, be sure they are inside
                 the sand paper
              5) Put a wax stopper in the other end of the pen where the ball
                 point came out
              6) Fill the front part of the pen with gunpowder and make sure
                 that the wax prevents it from spilling out

    The finished pen should look like this:

       Wax stopper          Gun powder              Matches & Snadpaper
            \                    |                           |
             \                   |                           |

    Applications:
    -------------

              Basically, antwhere there is writing to be done, there is a
         target for this device. Think of exams!! Heh, I don't think many
         people will be asking to borrow a pen from now on.

                               The Cat Bomb
_____________________________________________________________________________


    This phyle is for amusement only. We suggest that you do not try this
    out at home. Thanks to Mark Blitz for this idea.

         It has come to my attention that a real panic can be generated by
    a cat-bomb in a supermarket or department store.

    A cat-bomb is a simple and inexpensive thing to make.


    Materials:
    ----------
    1 cat - large
    1 sparkler or 1 ft. of waterproof fuse
    1 acetylene/oxygen torch
    1 book of matches

    Procedure:
    ----------
    Squeeze all air and shit out of cat, being careful not to kill same.
    Insert torch nozzle into cat's ass.
    Turn on a 50/50 mixture of the gasses, inflating the cat to approximately
    1/3 larger than normal.
    Insert either sparkler or fuse into cat's ass being careful to minimize
    gas release (some recommend stapling the orifice shut after insertion
    of fuse) very messy!

    Deployment:
    -----------
    Place cat in a place of demonstration, and light fuse with matches.
    Retire quickly to a safe place, (entraails will be a-flying soon)

    Cautions:
    ---------
    Recent experiments with larger animals have shown a 10 minute railroad
    flare to be of substantially greater sealing capacity than the fuse or
    sparkler method. Greater gas retention and thus a greater explosion are
    possible in this manner.

     Part Two:     Chemical Explosives
     ---------     -------------------

_____________________________________________________________________________

                             Astrolite Mixtures
_____________________________________________________________________________


    Astrolite:
    ----------

              Astrolite is a liquid explosive which was a product of rocket
         propellant research in the 60's. Astrolite A-1-5 is said to be the
         world's most powerful non-nuclear explosive. It is approximately 2
         times more powerful than TNT and is safer to handle.


    Astrolite G
    -----------

         Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to pro-
         duce very high detonation velocity, 8600 mps (meters/sec.) compared
         with 7,700 mps for nitroglycerine and 6,900 mps for TNT............
         In addition, a very unusual characteristic is that the liquid expl-
         osive has the ability  to be absorbed easily into the ground while
         remaining detonatable.... In field tests, Astrolite G has remained
         detonatable in the ground for 4 days,  even after being exposed to
         rain.


    Procedure:
    ----------

         Mix 2 parts (by weight) of ammonium nitrate with 1 part anhydrous
         hydrazine. The 2:1 ratio is not exactly perfect but if you screw
         around with the mixture, you will find a better formula.

         Hydrazine is quite hard to get ahold of. t is used in; Rocket fuel,
         agricultural chemicals (maleic hydrazide), drugs (antibacterial &
         antihypertension), polymerization catalyst, solder fluxes, photo-
         graphic development & diving equipment. Hydrazine is a chemical
         that you should be careful with.


    Astrolite A/A-1-5
    -----------------

         Mix 20% (weight) aluminium powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then
         mix with the hydrazine. The aluminium powder should be 100 mesh or
         finer. Astrolite A has a detonation velocity of 7,800 mps.
