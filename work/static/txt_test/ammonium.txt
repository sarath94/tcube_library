Formulas For Ammonium Nitrate Compounds
---------------------------------------

(Note: In the Anarchist Cookbook, there are originally 61 formulas. I am
only including 10 of the 61 here for two reasons: 1) To cut disk space, and
2) Most of the formulas are VERY similar)

        The formulas listed above are for high explosives. They are not for
cherry bombs or Roman candles. The ingredients that make up these formulas
have several functions: The first is the explosive agent itself, the second is
the stabilizing agent, and third is a texturizer (paraffin). Below are listed
the most important and common ingredients that are used to form an explosive
compound, and a description of their purpose and function.

[Ammonium Nitrate]: An extremely unstable, white explosive, usually in
        crystalline form.
[Aluminum]: A silver metallic powder, when in pyro grade, it is a major
        ingredient in many ammonal explosive compounds.
[Ammonium Oxalate]: A very valuable stabilizing agent, especially for nitro.
[Barium Nitrate]: Nitrated barium, in white crystalline powdered form.
[Charcoal Powder]: A fine black powder, which is extremely absorbent, and used
        extensively in pyrotechnics.
[Guncotton]: Nitrated cellulose (sawdust) is fairly stable, but usually used
        with other ingredients rather than alone. It is about 13-14% nitrogen.
[Naphthalene]: This is a sensitizing agent that is normally in a white
        crystalline form.
[Paraffin]: This is a primary ingredient in plastique, and acts as a
        texturizer.
[Potassium Nitrate]: An explosive compound in itself, which is stable. It is
        usually in a white crystalline form.
[Potassium Perchloride]: A white powder used as an igniting agent in high
        explosives. It is an extremely common ingredient in low explosives.
[Resin]: A gummy substance, which is flammable, and used in high explosives as
        an igniting agent.
[Sodium Carbonate]: This white crystalline powder acts to neutralize acid,
        which may make the explosive more unstable than it normally is.
[Sodium Chloride]: This is nothing more than ordinary table salt, and is used
        as a cooling agent in many high explosives.
[Sodium Nitrate]: A stable explosive compound which has the advantage of
        being water-absorbent.
[Sodium Sulfate]: A stabilizing powder, which is water-resistant.
[Starch]: This can be either potato or corn starch, and acts as an absorbent
        in many explosive compounds.
[Sulfur]: A yellow crystalline powder, which should be used in flour form
        only.
[Vaseline]: A clear petroleum jelly used in a similar manner as paraffin, as
        a plasticizer, for many forms of exploding gelatins and plastic 
        explosives.
