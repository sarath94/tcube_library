ingredients:

-gasoline - 1 part
-oil - 1 half part
-styrofoam - 1

1) melt styrofoam.
  -Remember never at any time let the mixture get too hot.

2) Let cool to a thick viscosity.

3) Mix 3 ingredients together in following order:
   first add styrofoam, then oil, then gas.

4) Mix in a deep pot - keep mixture away from any type of fire! Do this

5) let the mixture cool to a little bit warmer than room temperature -
   around 88 degrees farenheit.

6) Mold the mixture how you want.
   (Different shapes will make it more or less lethal).

Optional: you can add nuts, bolts, and screws while mixing,
along with gunpowder, 2 m-80's, or any other type of explosive
to make it the equivilant of a molotov cocktail.

Note: the fragments (nuts, bolt, etc.) Are deadly.
They will penetrate a brick wall when the mixture is detonated.

:Detonation:
============

1) the mixture can be thrown, but sometimes detonation does not occur.

2) The mixture can be wired for an electric charge to be sent through
   it, it will detonate without doubt.
