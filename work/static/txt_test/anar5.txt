
NEXT ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB BOMB

Materials--->> An unbroken light bulb, a hand drill, gunpowder, wax or
               chewed up gum.

Procedure--->> Take the lightbulb and  drill a small, 1/4 - 1/2" hole in it.
     Be careful not to break the filament inside. Take the gunpowder and place
     it in the lightbulb. Pack it tight, but again, don't break the filament.
     Seal the lightbulb with with the wax or gum, and put it in a light
     fixture

       I hope you like this partial handbook. I can't take all the credit for
    all the designs. I had some help creating them. And one more thing, be
careful out there!


P.S-->> And thanks to ACE for writing this out.
P.S.S--->> Keep looking for volume 2
