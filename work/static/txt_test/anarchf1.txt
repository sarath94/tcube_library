   In this issue we will be dealing with the recreational or fun explosives, 
the Plans for offensive devices <landmines, letterbombs, pipebombs, etc..> I 
 will include in Issue 2. Of course anyone with an IQ high enough to melt Ice
can figure the stuff out how to make the things included here into said 
offensive devices, i wont actually include the plans. Well, I'll cut the 
Babbling and get on to the good stuff.....

  OK, now that that is done with, lets move on to the good stuff...
 
   well a problem i used to have alot is that i could never find chemicals, so 
that you wont encounter this, here is a list of household equivalants...

        ---------------                           ----------------
 
 
      SMOKE BOMB 
    --------------
 mix:
   4 parts sugar
   6 parts potassium nitrate
heat over low flame until mixture is melted. stir well. pour into container.
Before this solidifies place a few matched in it as fuses. I have found that
another good way to get this to start burning is to pur the melted mixture into
a paper cup, these are usually layred in parrafin wax, and there for burn very
well, so all you have to do is set the cup on fire....
 
    SMOKE BOMB #2
  ----------------
   mix:
    6 parts zinc powder
    1 part sulfur powder
 
  Insert a red-hot wire into the pile to ignite it.Once again placing the mix-
ture in a paper cup and dimply lighting the cups, is also usually effective.
 
 
OK, now for some of the REALLY fun stuff...
  
    Jug Bomb
   ----------
Get a glass jug.<with a metal cap>
Place a few drops of Gasoline in the jar and cap the top.
Now turn the jug around to coat the inner surfaces with gasoline thinly, so it
evaporates.
Now add a few drop of Potassium Permanganate. < you can get this really easy 
from a snake-bite-kit.>
This is detonated really easy by throwing it against a solid object, and 
running away FAST when this sucker goes off it has the force of a 1/2 stick,
plus glass will be flying everywhere.
 
 
     Acetyline Bomb
    ----------------
   *VERY DANGEROUS*
  get some Calcium Carbide Crystals < obtainable from hardware stores and 
      sporting catalogs>
  ordianary water <H20>
 
Take a few Pieces of the Calcium Carbide and place it in a jar with some water
and cap the jar tightly. The carbide reacts with the water to form Acetyline
Carbonate,  this is the stuff they use in cutting torches. Anyway, the glass
jar will soon burst from the mounting internal pressure..
if you leave a burning rag near by this will produce a nice fireball. 
 
 OK, here is a realatively simple, yet extremely fun bomb...
                  "Johnny (Fat Man) Campo Bomb" 
   
    Get a large cylindrical cardboard container; fill this container half full
of `Comet` (tm) < VERY important to avoid patent infringement! ><yeah..right>
<dont use `Ajax` , its not as good>. Poke a 1/8th inch hole in the side of the
container at the halfway point. Insert the explosive charge in the center of
the container, and run the fuse thru the hole. < i use  m-80's , but I have 
heard that h-100's work just as well. >pour more comet on the explosive charge
to the top of the container. Pack down well.  put the lid on the container.
tape the lid and base with electrical or duct tape <i prefer Duct tape>
when you light this run away QUICKLY , unless you like existing in a large 
flaming cloud of sink cleaner.
 
 
and now for the best known of the easy bombs....
 
     NITROGEN TRI-IODIDE   method #1
   -----------------------------------
 
add 6 - 9 g solid iodine crystals to 45ml ammonia in a 150ml beaker. stir,0|VHxlet stand for five minutes. do the following within 10 minutes. retain the 
solid, decant the liquid. Scrape the solid onto a peice of filter paper. Then 
divide this pile into eigths , and place each part on a separate peice of paper
. place these peices at least three feet apart < so they do not set each other
off..>. leave them undisturbed for about 45minutes, to dry..  when wet this 
compund is COMPLETELY safe <unless you do something really stupid, like eat it>
but when dry it is HIGHLY shock sensitive, to the point of a voice setting it 
off.
 
 
     NITROGEN TRI-IODIDE   method #2
   -----------------------------------
 
Mix 3 grams of Potassium Iodide and 5 grams in of iodine in a beaker with 50ml
of water . then add 20 ml of Ammonium Hydroxide(Ammonia water 10%)<on bottles 
of Amonia it says what the ratio of Ammonia to water is>
Filter and the resulting solid is Nitrigen Tri-iodide <follow the instructions
for method #1 for what to do at this point..>
 
     PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE
    -------------------
 
  powder 9 grams of Potassium Chlorate in a mortar and pestle < or something
similar >. Place 9 grams of powdered Potassium Chlorate and 1 gram of 
petroleum jelly <vaseline> in a wide bowl. Knead the ingredients with your 
hands until a uniform paste is obtained. Store this explosive in a waterproof
container until you are ready to use it. Once again, this compound is totally
safe when wet, but highly shock sensitive when dry. Throw it <far> against a 
hard object to make it go *B00M*
 
    NAPALM <basically>
   --------------------
 
   Make a mixture of 1/2 Joy <dishwashing liquid and 1/2 Gasoline. Take a soda
can <beer can, what ever..> with the top sawed off; and fill it half full with
this mixture. Take a drill or some other sharp object, and put a hole through
an Ammonia Pellet <available at farm supply stores..>; big enough to fit a 
nail. now put a nail through the pellet and wire the pellet to the top of the
can, so that the nail can be slipped out easily; allowing the pellet to drop.
*WARNING* letting the pellet fall into the liquid will explode the NAPALM,
  IN OTHER WORDS, DONT LET THE PELLET FALL INTO THE NAPALM!
maybe i shouldnt have included this here.. but i did...
 
 
    GUNPOWDER  <generic>
   ----------------------
    3 cups Potassium Nitrate < saltpeter, as i said earlier>
    2 cups Charcoal 
    1/2 cups Sulfur
 
*SEPARATELY* grind the chemicals to fine powders < once again, SEPARATELY!>
with a mortar & pastle < or simialar device >. Place all ingredients in a 
heat resistant bucket. add 1 cup water and stir thoroughly until everything is
dissolved. Add teo more cups of water to this mixture. Place bucket on a heat 
source < i use a Electric Heating Pad(its like a single burner from an electric
stove)>; and stir until small bubbles begin to form. 
*CAUTION* Do not boil mixture. Be sure all mixture stays wet. If any is dry, 
          as on sides of pan; it may ignite.
Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into a bucket with 5 PINTS of alcohol
(rubbing alcohol, etc.) *while stirring vigorously all the time*. Let alcohol 
stand for about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to obtain Black Powder.
Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around Black Powder and squeeze to remove all excess
liquid. Place screening <as from a screen door> on top of a DRY bucket. Place
workable amount of damp powder on screen and granulate by rubbing over screen.
Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about 1/2 inch thic
is formed.  This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably within one 
hour. The longer the drying period, the less effective the black powder.
 
 
 
          GUNCOTTON  <smokeless powder>
        --------------------------------
             <cellulose nitrate>
 
  Place a 250ml beaker in an ice bath. Add 70ml Sulfuric Acid, 30 ml Nitric 
acid. <in the BEAKER>. Divde 5g of absorbent cotton into as many .7g pieces as
you can.  With tings immerse each peice in the acid solution for one minute. 
Next, rinse each peice in 3 succesive baths of 500ml water. USE FRESH WATER FOR
EACH PEICE!  Then immerse in 250ml of 1M Sodium Bicarbonate. If it bubbles 
rinse in water once more, or until no bubbling occurs. Squeeze dry and spread
on paper towels to dry over night.
 
 
         PEROXYACETONE
       -----------------
 
  Add 4ML Acetone and 4ML Hydrogen peroxide to a Tes Tube. Then add 4 drops
concentrated Hydrochloric acid in 10-20 minutes a white solid should start to 
form.  If you dont see any change, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40
degrees centigrade.  Allow the reaction to continue for two hours.  Swirl the
slurry and filter it. Leave out on Filter paper to dry for two hours.  To 
ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it<STAY AT LEAST A METER
AWAY!>
 
 
 
  well OK, these have all been fairly simple experiments. I have tried them all
many times and they work just fine BE VERY VERY CAREFUL! especially with the 
Napalm bomb, that is the most dangerous one included here. I suggest that 
anyone who doesnt have much experience in chemistry and Explosives, READ THE
PYRO SERIES OF TEXTFILES! these are the best guide for beginners that i have 
encountered.  
 
I'd just like to Thank a couple of people ,
The Purple Snorkle-Whacker, for being VERY patient waiting for me to write this
Sketch/The Slipped Disk; for letting me post "inane" comments.
