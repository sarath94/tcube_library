SO YOU WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL. WELL, IF YOU ARE WANTING TO BE LIKE JAMES BOND
 AND OPEN A LOCK IN FIFTEEN SECONDS, GO TO HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
 PLACE YOUR GONNA DO IT. EVEN EXPERIENCED LOCKSMITHS CAN SPEND 5 TO 10 MINUTES
 ON A LOCK IF THEY'RE UNLUCKY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXTREMELY QUICK ACCESS,
 LOOK ELSEWHERE.
  THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN MOSTLY TO THE "LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE
 LOCK, SINCE IT IS THE EASIEST TO PICK. IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT DEMAND, I WILL
 LATER WRITE A FILE DISCUSSING THE OTHER FORMS OF ENTRANCE, INCLUDING DEAD-BOLT

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET. IF YOU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE YOU
 A SET. THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE. IF YOU FIND A
 LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. ITN'T GET DISCOURAGE ON YOUR FIRST TRY! IT WROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT
 20-30 MINUTES YOUR FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH
 PRACTICE.
  THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF ENTERING A HOUSE. IF YOU WOULD
 LIKE ANOTHER ITEM OR TWO DEVOTED TO THESE OTHER WAYS, LET THE SYSOP KNOW.







           How to Make a Landmine
                     by
           Merlin and Black knight

First you need to get a push button
switch... take the wires of it and
connect one to a 9 volt battery
connector and the other to a solar
igniter (if you can't get that then use
a thin piece of stereo wire).

Connect the other wire of the 9 volt
connector to to the other end of the
solar igniter (stereo wire).

Now... connect the end of a fuse (of
a pipe bomb, M80, whatever has a fuse)
to the solar igniter...

Dig a hole... not to deep but enough to
cover all the materials. Think about
what direction your enemy will coming
from and plant the switch, but leave
the button visible (not to visible).
Plant the explosive about 3 feet from
the switch because there will be a
delay in the explosion.
And when your enemy steps on it...

                           HIGHWAY RADAR JAMMING

   Most drivers wanting to make better time on the open road will arm
themselves with an expensive radar detector.  However this device will not work
against a gun type radar unit in which the radar signal is not present until
the cop has you car in his sights and pull the trigger. Then it is too late to
slow down.
   A better method is to continously jam any signal with a radar signal of your
own. I have tested this idea with the cooperation of a local cop and found that
his unit reads random numbers when your car approached him. It is suprisingly
easy to make a low power radar transmitter.  A nifty little semiconductor
called a Gunn diode will generate microwaves when supplied with 5 to 10 vdc and
enclosed in the correct size cavity (resonator). An 8 to 3 terminal regulator
can be used to get this voltage from a car's system.  However the correct
construction and tuning of the cavity is difficult without good microwave
measurement equipment.  Police radars commonly operate on the K band at 22 ghz.
or more often on the X band at 10.525 ghz.  Most microwave intruder alarms and
motion detectors (mounted over automatic doors in supermarkets, etc.) contain a
Gunn type transmitter/receiver combination that transmits about 10 milliwatts
at 10.525 ghz.  These units work perfectly as jammers.  If you can't get one
locally write to Microwave Associates in Burlington, Mass. and ask for info on
"Gunnplexers" for ham radio use.  When you get the unit it may be mounted in a
plastic box on the dash or in a weatherproof enclosure behind the plastic
grille.  Switch on the power when on the open highway.  The unit will not jam
radar to the side of behind the car so don't go speeding past the radar trap.
   An interesting phenomena you will notice is that drivers in front of you who
are using detectors will hit their brakes as you approach large metal signs or
bridges.  Your signal is bouncing off these objects and triggering their
detectors.

                      How to Have Fun at K-Mart
                          By: The Daredevil

                          The Police Station
                             612-934-4880


  Well, first off, one must realise the importance of K-Marts in
society today. First off, K-Marts provide things cheaper to those who
can't afford to shop at higher quality stores.  Although, all I ever
see in there is minorities and Senior Citizens, and the poor people in
our city.  Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead in there.  But, once,
I did.

  You see, once, after The Moon Roach and Havoc Chaos(Dear friends of
mine) and I were exploring such fun things as rooftops, we came along
a K-Mart.  Amused, and cold for that matter, we wandered in.  The
Tension mounts.

  As we walked up to te entrance, we were nearly attacked by Youth
Groups selling cheap cookies, and wheelchair sticken people selling
American Flags.  After laughing at these people, we entered. This is
where the real fun begins...

  First, we wandered around the store, and turned on all the blue
lights we could find. That really distracts and confuses the
attendents...Fun to do...

  The first neat thing, is to go to the section of the store where
they sell computers. Darkness engulf the earth the day they find Apple
Computers being sold there.  Instead, lesser computers like the
laughable Vic-20 can be found there...Turn it on, and make sure
nobody's looking...Then, once in Basic, type...

]10 PRINT "Fuck the world!  Anarchy Rules!" (or something to that
                                             effect.)
]20 GOTO 10 and walk away.

  Also, set the sample radios in the store to a santanic rock station,
and turn the radio off.  Then, set the alarm for two minutes ahead of
the time displayed there.  Turn the volume up all the way, and walk
away.  After about two minutes, you will see the clerk feebly attempt
to turn the radio down or off.  It's really neat to set ten or more
radios to different stations, and walk away.

  One of my favorite things to do, is to get onto the intercom system
of the store.  Easi5 typed then done.  First, check out the garden
department.  You say there's no attendent there? Good.  Sneak
carefully over to the phone behind the cheap counter there, and pick
it up.  Dial the number corrisponding to the item that says 'PAGE'...
And talk.  You will note that your voice will echo all over the bowels
of K-Mart.

  I would suggest announcing something on the lines of:"Anarchy
rules!!"

                       The Anarchy Manual
                      <------------------>
                       Written by: Jonin Meka of
                                   The Black Hand Society

Section One: The essence of terrorism

Welcome ! In the following text I will attempt to explain to you the way of
Anarchy and how to be an Anarchist. One major section of Anarchy is terrorism.
Terrorism is to me the best thing ever to grace man's path. Personally I love
terrorism because- well the reason is because I really hate strangers.
Sometimes I'll decide to blow someone's car or house or even the person all
together just because they don't look right. But now back to terrorism:
Terrorism defined as "mass-organized ruthlessness" and a terrorist is defined
as "one who rules by terror." Both of these descriptions are fairly accurate
but to me terrorism is the hatred of all good, organization, love, and
anything liked by normal morons who live in our disgusting society we all call
free ! Therefore terrorism is the destruction of society. I love that ! To be
a
terrorist you must have this attitude ! Don't read any farther unless you are
a terrorist. Well, now the we all have the understanding of terrorism we can
begin. Note- you don't have to have killed to be a terrorist. Just be sure you
love love to
cause terror !!!

Section Two: Simple Terrorism

Welcome again ! Before I write anymore I must tell you that the reason I am
writing this manual is because I wish to spread terroristic ideals and ideas.
Also I wish to tell you that Black Hand Society rules. Well, on with it. The
following are some of my own little goodies that I like to do once in a while.
One more thing- this manual does not explain how to make destruction devices
or any of that kind of stuff. And finally one more thing- I find
experimentation is best when trying to terrorize someone or something. Here we
go !

section two point one: ding dong ditch

Ding dong ditch (DDD) is probably one of the simplest forms of terrorism
known. It is played by millions and is also the check point for a future
terrorist. What I mean is that we a kid first plays DDD he sub-consciously
decides if he will be a terrorist. I still love to play this game but I add
little things here and there like ringing the door bell,running,and then
shooting the moron who answers with a BB gun or with a rock shot with a wrist
rocket. Other things are possible too such as ringing the doorbell, and not
running. This takes great courage and I find it stupid but extremely funny !
Like the time my friend rang some morons doorbell then pretended to be
selling....well shall I say sexual protection for both men and women. There
was one problem with this though- while my friend was talking I couldn't stop
cracking my head off ! So finally when the moron decided to (I can't believe
this happened) buy some I just had to stop the humility by taking an M-80 and
shooting it (with the Wrist Rocket) through the guys window. Boom ! That was
the end of "Trojan Distributing Western New York Division." (God was that a
laugh!)

section two point two: shoplifting

Ahhh my favorite. Here is the best and most economical way to obtain anything
you desire: Shoplifting ! One note- this is highly dangerous in these days of
hidden cameras and microphones so be very careful and if all else fails and
you're caught but some stupid moron of a "store-detective" just be sure to
keep a cube of "potassium chloride plastic explosives" with so you can light
it
while the moron has you by the arm and is taking you wherever it is they take
you when your caught. Well on to some safety clauses. For one always be silent
while shoplifting as of the microphones (if any). Next always look for two-way
mirrors, black spots on any store walls, and most of all people who stay in a
store for more than an hour- They're Narcs ! And now for some advanced
techniques. One I find to be fun is to stuff my jacket then go up to the
register and then buy something small ! That really confuses the people.
Another trick is to have your friend buy something while you talk to him and
at the same time have a goodie right in your own hand then just walk out of
the store still talking with your friend. One last thing- bagging goods with
stuff you already bought is stupid unless the store doesn't give reciepts but
what the f--k is you're good enough !!!

section two point three: illegal entry

Another of my favorites. What is there really to say about illegal entry
except for it is a great way to attract attention to a neighborhood. I mean
with all the cops that come around the next day. Also this is a great way to
obtain valuable goodies like electronic equipment. One thing never do this in
your own neighborhood because you won't be able to use the goodies you
obtain. Well here we go again. Never break into a house with people in it if
you are trying to obtain goodies and also never break into a house with an
alarm (no s--t!). Always observe the area you're going to break into before
entering and look through the window next to the front door to see if they
have an alarm. There are several ways to break in: One is to lockpick your way
through but to the novice this may take time and years of learning but one
advantage is that it is real silent and undetectable. Another way is to use
the BB gun Ice pick method. First bring your BB gun (pistol preferable) and
shoot a small hole next to the lock. Then use the Ice pick or some other
device to undo the lock on the window. Never leave anything of yours at the
scene. Cat numbers and the such are traced quick. One final
way to enter is to just crash the window with a stick. This is really noisy
but fun. If you want to do this the target window should be next to another
noisy place like a street or something. Also don't spend to much time in the
place after entering and most off wear gloves and a black suit and always
enter a night. One more,thing I find it enjoyable to paint some type of remark
or sarcastic saying (real big of course) on one of the main walls. Such an
example would be a certain symbol like a pentagram or a saying like "fuck off"
(simple but suggestive) or to be creative "you have bad taste in panties and
curtains" or my favorite "pigs have little dicks." Most of all be creative
when signing you're little messages usually I sign them by putting "You're
worst dream" and "love, John". You may find it wasteful to write such messages
but personally I think terrorism should be funny, sarcastic, and confusing.
Two more things- try not to leave any trace of yourself such as articles of
your clothing or even your blood (you might cut yourself if you break the
window). And if you consider yourself a common theif, DON'T! You are an
Anarchist and a Terrorist !!!

section two point four: Misc.

Here are other simple things you might like to do:

1) Enter a place with people in it and sneak up them and then totally surprise
the f--k out of them while theY're sleeping. You might do this by screaming
and
hollering at the foot of their bed or by setting their bedroom curtain on fire
and then scream and holler at the foot of their bed. Scream "Get out the house
!! There is a f--king fire !!!" Also if you're horny you might decide to
pretend to be the husband and molest the wife while she's sleeping. Think of
the possibilities. Pretending to be the husband is my favorite because....well
I'm horny. I start off by gently massaging the women's breast and then taking
my other hand and venturing into beaver land ! Another thing I find enjoyable
is if the the women is alone in the house I do the above but when she wakes up
I simply knock her out with the stick I used to break in with. If you plan to
do this be sure that as soon as she opens her eyes you give her a swift blow
to the head. Don't wait for her to scream for God's sake ! After you have done
this it's one for all and one for one. One more thing if you're really horny I
suggest you tie her up and then wait for her to wake. Note- Do note consider
this rape! It is not! It is terrorist tension relief. Also it was done under
pleasant circumstances.

2) Letting the air out of people's car tires has always been fun but I prefer
to blow the tires up with impact explosives better. Also I recommend blowing
up
the whole car. This is not only fun but it makes great reading light. May I
also suggest you do the above before you read the rest of the manual. That way
after you blow the car up you can sit next to a great reading light and read
some more of this manual while the car burns. And finally one more thing- I
love to watch the people scurrying trying to put the car out. I mean if they
had any brains they would not it is impossible especially if you put a buck
of Napalm in their front seat. Also I suggest you paint the ground surrounding
the car with impact explosives. That way when the car blows up (or just starts
on fire) as soon as the people run to the car and watch it burn they'll step
on the dried explosives and blow themselves up. Note- This is really cruel but
what the hell! You're a terrorist!

3) Lastly, suggest you....well fuck I'll let you create your own little
goodies for you to do. I've given you a start now go out and experiment !
Note- I have lots more but I don't want to give away all my secrets. (maybe in
later issues.)

Section Three: Destruction (and death as a result)

Many of you I suspect don't want to become murders so I suggest you don't read
any further.It takes a great hatred to kill a human being and I highly
recommend you don't do it. Not only is it really evil but you will have severe
guilt trips and may even commit suicide as a result. Personally I don't care
anymore and could give a fuck about everything but occasionally I do regret
all the things I've done. Please don't read the rest of the manual unless for
entertainment purposes otherwise welcome to the world of Hell. (ha ha ha!)
(Stupid ? Well yes to a mere human but to a terrorist the above is a sign of
greatness. I mean a terrorist should be crazy !!!)

(This concludes this volume of The Anarchy manual. Watch for volume two in the
next couple of months.)


          Kill Thy Neighbor


Preface
-------
     If you do indeed take the
information provided in this art-
icle seriously enough to do it,
please forget where you read it.

Poisons:
--------
     The first and probably least
known way to maime(such a nice word)
someone is through the use of
various herbal extracts..(no I
don't mean Sinsemella)

Diffenbachia (dumbcane)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Take 2-4 of the leaves and boil
them in water (don't inhale the fumes)
When the water becomes a greenish
color, take the leaves and throw
them away..Now take the liquid and
add it to the victims drink,food
etc..The victims voice goes kaput.

Oleander.
=-=-=-=-=
Take a twig of this bush and grind
it into a fine powder..Place the
powder in the salt shaker,or sub-
stitute it for any other type of
seasoning...Causes death within
3-4 hours...sometimes quicker

Poison Oak/Ivy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Take the leaves and do the above
process..Or boil the leaves and
when the water turns brownish/green
pour it out into a vial...Add a few
drops to the victims beverage..
It tends to destroy the victims
vocal cords...

Systemic roses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Take a rose bush and soak the ground
around it with a very poisonous
fertilizer..In the days following
the roses leaves,stems,etc will
become highly deadly..When the
victim gets scratched by it..He/she
dies..

Poisons Part 2
--------------
     The second and more common
poisons are that of deadly metals
and earthy extracts.

Sodium Arsenide.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This along with Lead Arsenide rank
in the top ten of leathal materials
Sodium Arsenide can be aquired at
a glass staining shop..It is placed
int the victims food,etc.

Potassium Cyanide.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This is chemical is contained in
appleseeds..To get it you must
grind up about 12 oz of apple seeds
..The effect is close to radiation
poisoning...It kills within 6 hours

      /
Curare.
=-=-=-=
This substance is basically a ba28rd
poison..It is various poisons
combined into a leathal dosage..It
kills within 45 minutes.

Lead.
=-=-=
Although this material is very common
it is also very deadly..Take about
30-40 grams of lead shavings(dust)
and put them in someones food..
It does wonders....<ack!>

Mercury.
=-=-=-=-
Mercury is a highly deadly material
that kills skin on contact...To use
most effectivly,place about 20 grams
wherever the victim might place
his hand or any other part of his
body for that matter..Or place
it in his food supply...It to does
wonders...<ack!>

Plutonium.
=-=-=-=-=-
This material along with Pulonium,
is <VERY> deadly...It causes cancer
in even the most minute dosages.
If the victim is exposed to it he
will die within a week of radiation
poisoning....<glow in the dark!>

Others (Unknown!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Although it is impossible to list
all of the deadly substances here
I will show how to make contact
poison...

(credit to Ima Hacker)
take 3 no-fly pest strips (tm)
place them in a jar of turpentine
overnight..In the morning scoop out
the white/brown gel at the bottom.

it kills in 60 seconds..Count 'em

(again credit must go to Ima Hacker)

Highway Accidents???
--------------------
     The following section describes
various was to seriously harm
the occupant by destroying the
victims car...

Explosions
=-=-=-=-=-
Take a film canister filled with
liquid drano and drop it into the
gas tank...Do this just before your
target enters his car...When he's
driving down the freeway or any
other part of the HTS his car will
suddenly become engulfed in flame.

Carbon Monoxide (CO)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Drill a small hole into the exhaust
system of the victims car..From it
run a length of tubing into the
passenger compartment..After 20
minutes he will fall onto the floor
and most probably die when he hits
something.

Stuck Accelerator
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Find the victims throttle cable and
cut it..now follow the piece coming
out of the manifold..Now supposing
you found where it intersects the
valve...There should be a small
spring there that keeps the valve
closed...Cut it...push the valve
open....clean up...When Mr. Victim
starts his car the engine will race.
when he shifts he should fly out of
control down the roadway..until
<KERASH>


Other more messy ways
---------------------
     This section is not really what
you would call classic..but i suppose
it'll have to do.

The Chain saw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Don a ski mask and follow your victim.
When he stops and turns around...
Give his limbs a vacation with
your nifty poulan chainsaw.......

The Exploding House.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Take one pound of plastique and a
blasting cap...hook the two wires
of the blasting cap onto your victims
telephone Box..insert the blasting
cap into the plastique..Now place
the plastique underneath the victims
gas meter..Go to a pay phone and dial
his number...when the phone rings

<BAAAARRROOOOOOMM!>
house and all...

                         Miscellanous Nasties
                            By: Lex Luthor

                          The Police Station
                             612-934-4880


                              FIREBOMBS

   Most fire bombs are simply gasoline filled bottles with a fuel
soaked rag in the mouth (the bottle's mouth, not yours). The original
Molotov cocktail, and still about the best, was a mixture of one part
gasoline and one part motor oil. The oil helps it to cling to what it
splatters on.

   Some use one part roofing tar and one part gasoline. Fire bombs
have been found whcih were made by pouring melted wax into gasoline.


                                NAPALM

    About the best fire bomb is napalm. It has a thick consistancy,
like jam and is best for use on vehilces or buildings.

    Napalms is simply one part gasoline and one part soap. The soap is
either soap flakes or shredded bar soap. Detergents won't do.

    The gasoline must be heated in order for the soap to melt. The
usual way is with a double boiler where the top part has at least a
two-quart capicity. The water in the bottom part is brought to a boil
and the double boiler is taken from the stove and carried to where
there is no flame.

   Then one part, by volume, of gasoline is put in the top part and
allowed to heat as much as it will and the soap is added and the mess
is stirred until it thickens. A better way to heat gasoline is to fill
a bathtub with water as hot as you can get it. It will hold its heat
longer and permit a much larger container than will the double boiler.


                           MATCH HEAD BOMB

   Simple safety match heads in a pipe, capped at both ends, make a
devestating bomb. It is set off with a regular fuse

   A plastic Baggie is put into the pipe before the heads go in to
prevent detonation by contact with the metal.

   Cutting enough match heads to fill the pipe can be tedious work for
one but an evening's fun for the family if you can drag them away from
the TV.


                       FUSE IGNITION FIRE BOMB

   A four strand homemade fuse is used for this. It burns like fury.
It is held down and concealed by a strip of bent tin cut from a can.
The exposed end of the fuse is dipped into the flare igniter. To use
this one, you light the fuse and hold the fire bomb until the fuse has
burned out of sight under the tin. Then throw it and when it breaks,
the burning fuse will ignite the contents.

Record Revenge
--------------
    One day when you and a friend are bored make a strong electromagnet that
will fit in a coat pocket then go into a record store and make like your
shopping picking up the tapes putting them back and if you made the
electomagnet strong enough when you walk by the tapes should erase, you can
do the same to video tapes causing the store to loose money.

Windows
-------
On a cold day take some rubber cement( the flammable kind) and go to someone's
house of whom you donot like put some rubber cement on the window, better if
you do it to a bay window, light it and leave.  The window should crack.

Parked Cars
-----------
If you find a car with its doors unlocked, especially at night go in turn on
the lights and leave, next morning the person will be pissed cause of his
stupidity to leave the lights on all night

Bike Track
----------
During the summer get together with some friends who have bikes(normal dirt,
not mechanical) and ride through people yards if you do this frequently then
the grass will ware away and you have a niffty little track.

Light Bulbs
-----------
Go up to someone's house and take out as many light bulbs as possible in one
night without being caught, be imaginative with your uses for them.

Trash
-----
Around spring cleaning time when people throw alot of stuff away.  Go out and
get stuff like carpet, televisions, tables, chairs, and set them up as if to
make a room right outside on their front lawn.

Painting
--------
If your mark lives in a single story house get some black spray paint and
paint all the windows.  Make paint bombs and throw at house for nice abstract
painting effect.  The bombs are easy to make and there are a couple of ways
to make them. One way is to take baggies and put paint inside close tightly
then throw or you can take milk cartons (small ones like at school) drink the
milk pour in paint reglue it and throw, these are excellent to throw at
parked cars from a moving car.  Florecent orange is great and if the people
don't really look harder to see on a white hose compared to black paint not
to mention the fun at night when their house starts to glow.

Barf
----
Barf is fun to use too and fake barf is more easier to obtain.  Here is a
recipe for it that works well.  Put all these things into a container,
baggie(zip-lock) in unlimited proportions.  Whipped cream, special K, grapes,
Hershey's Chocolate Syrup, maple syrup, dish detergent, and a little warm
water.  Zip-lock it and shake it should look brownish in color and smell
awlful.  Go to your marks house and dump on the front door, try to get inside
of screen, even more fun if the front door is open.

Delivery Services
-----------------
I know this kid who's a real ass and he works at a pizza shop so me and a
friend ordered a pizza to this house.  When he delivered it we threw rocks
and stuff at him.

Obstacles
---------
Get some fishing line, 20pound test kind.  Go up to someone's house and tie it
around their railing, at ankle level, and other things like trees, bushes and
something loose like lawn furnichure.  Then go up to their house and get them
to chase you, What fun!

Fireworks
---------
Get some bottle rockets and aim them right at your marks bay window, light.
Make a match stik bomb(end of file) and light on someones porch.  Ring bell
and run.

Swimming Pools
--------------
If your mark has a swimming pool get an awe and puncture the side of it as
close to the ground as possiable or maybe add some bubble bath to it ot if
you want to be really fuckin tight.  Get hold of some acid preferablly
hydochloric get the higher molar soulution you can then one night, right
before the have a pool party dump it in, it is going to take a lot but it
will be worth it tommarrow when they go in and a few minutes later they feel
really hot and their skin starts falling off.  If anybody out there has
gotten HCl on them and remember how it felt, think of it all over somebody.

Woodpiles
---------
The bigger they are the better they fall.  Get some friends together and have
them line up along the pile.  On the count of three push then get the hell
out of there.

     Whatever you do at night have fun doing it and don't get caught.  Some
recommendations, learn the yards around your neighborhood, knowing who has a
dog is useful too, learn to identify cars (cops, marks). Never chicken out if
someone in your group gets caught and you get away, have a set up where if
the mark takes the person in the house, have everyone else throw rocks at the
house so the person can escape.  If someone starts chasing you, get them to
chase you behind peoples houses then lead them to where you know there is a
wood pile. knock it over and keep running, chances are that if there are a
bunch of kids chasing you the guy will come out and assume they knocked over
his wood pile and fuck them over. Later.

Matchstik bomb
--------------
It is not a bomb that blows up but is more of a flare.  Go to a store like CVS
or Pathmark and buy some matches(they come in boxes and are about 43cents
each) rip apart package saving the cardboard box.  Get some good sharp
siccors and cut just below the match head, do this to the whole package
putting heads in cardboard box.  Get a container and put them in there.  I'll
use a tennis ball with a hole poked in it, get a fuse or take an old shirt
rip into little strips and substitute.  Put the fuse in the hole and pour in
matchheads, you may need 2 or more boxes.  Pack them tightly, then dump some
lighter fluid on the fuse ,light and get away.  You can put tape around the
hole so matchheads won't fall out.

Dealing with Bitches
--------------------
Call up a girl whose a real bitch and make sure her parents answer.  Then
talking very nervously explain to her parent that you and her daughter had a
relationship and it ended when you got her pregnant and that your really
sorry then hang up.  Some kids did this to this girl I know and her mother
grounded her ass.  Now she isn't allowed to answer the phone if there is a
boy on the other end.

Lawn Fun
--------
Get hold of a lawn fertilizer, fill it with salt and spread across some
pecker's lawn.  About 2 months later, no lawn.

Obstacles
---------
If the mark is very private and lives in a house where the garage is part of
the house and they own one of those garage door openers.  Place things in
front of the doors so when they back out, they go right over it.  Me and a
friend took this guys love chair and put one leg of it in the handle of the
garage door. The next morning it busted his garage door opener and he
couldn't get his car out so he had to take a taxi to work.

Parked Cars
-----------
Get a couple of car jacks and place them under a car right under the axle then
raise it so that the wheel is just off the ground.

Porch Raiders
-------------
Go to some ones house with a couple of friends all armed with eggs, ring the
door bell and when someone comes to the door throw the eggs!

Gardens
-------
Now that it is spring people are starting to plant fruits and vegtables, when
they are ripe have a feast or take some veggies and do Porch Raiders
subsituding the eggs for their crop!

Getting Caught
--------------
No one wants to but stuff like this is easy to start but hard to stop.  Always
carry something so that if someone comes up you have a chance.  I carry a
substance that is corrosive to the eyes.  If you are unfortunate enough to get
caught everyone gang up on the person and beat the shit out of them.

Cookouts
--------
Find a cookout and go up and say "Hi, food almost done?"  Basically invite
yourself to everything.  If done the right way the people will be totally
baffeled!  Or if there is one at night and no one outside around the grill go
and take all the food!




OK, SO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN FIREWORKS?  NOTE: ALL THE AMOUNTS
GIVEN IN THESE DIRECTIONS ARE IN PARTS BY WEIGHT.  DO NOT USE PARTS BY VOLUME
(LIKE TEASPOONS OR SOMETHING), OR ELSE YOU COULD HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. 
ALWAYS MIX THESE CHEMICALS BY SHAKING THEM ON A SHEET OF PAPER OR SOMETHING. 
IF YOU GRIND THEM, STIR THEM, ETC. THEY COULD EXPLODE IN YOUR FACE!(AFTER
ALL, I DON'T WANT YOU TO KILL YOURSELF WHILE DOING THIS!)

FUSE:      1. DISSOLVE AS MUCH POTASSIUM NITRATE AS YOU CAN IN ABOUT A PINT OF
WATER AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.
           2. SOAK 5-6 INCH PIECES OF STRING OR PAPER IN THIS SOLUTION AND LET
THEM DRY.
           3. LIGHT THE FIREWORKS WITH THE STRING OR A PIECE OF PAPER ROLLED
INTO A TIGHT TUBE.

FLASH POWDER:      1. MIX:  1 PARTS POWDERED MAGNESIUM METAL & 4 PARTS
POWDERED POTASIUM NITRATE.
                   2. IGNITE WITH A VERY LONG FUSE.  THIS STUFF EXPLODES WITH
A HUGE WHITE FLASH, AND MAY BE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SCREW UP YOUR EYES IF YOU
LOOK STRAIGHT AT IT.

"SNAKES":      1. MIX:  5 PARTS POTASSIUM NITRATE
                       10 PARTS POTASSIUM DICHROMATE

               2. MIX THESE POWDERS WITH ENOUGH MUSCILAGE OF ACACIA (THAT
GOOEY BROWN GLUE YOU CAN GET AT A DRUGSTORE) SO THAT YOU CAN MOLD THEM INTO
CONES ABOUT 1/2 AN INCH HIGH.
               3. WHEN DRY, LIGHT THE TIPS OF THE CONES WITH A MATCH.

FOUNTAIN #1:      1. MIX:  1 PART POWDERED MAGNESIUM METAL

IT.







                    "83 Ways to Trash Your School"  6/23/86
                    ---------------------------------------

     Liberate your life!  Smash your school!  The public schools are slowly
killing every kid in them, stifling their creativity and individuality and
making them into non-persons.  If you are a victim of this one of the things
you
can do is fight back.

     This chapter is not written for people who are not yet sure whether
school
is good or bad.  It is written for students that realize the way that
compulsory
education and grades destroy the natural curiosity so many children feel... 
Who
realize how the tracking system keeps the poor people and minorities in our
society on the bottom while keeping the rich and powerful on the top...  Who
realize the danger of teaching complete obedience to authority and who are fed
up with the racism and sexism in schools.  It is written for students who have
"gone through channels" trying to correct these problems and who are tired of
helplessly waiting while the schools destroy more and more minds each day.  It
is written for young people who realize that because they are trapped in
school
they don't have a chance to learn what they need to know to create a free and
good life.

     Before trying any of the ideas in here you should think about the effect
they will have in view of the situation in your particular area.  Not all of
them will be effective at all times in all areas.  If you think of other ideas
please send them to us so we can print them in future editions.

  What You Can Do...

  1.  Get a syringe (minus the needle)
or similar device.  Mix two tubes of epoxy glue with a little rubbing alcohol.
You now have about half an hour to fill locks, door jams, etc., before glue
hardens.  If you can't get the epoxy glue and syringe, a tube of airplane
cement
can also be used although it is not as permanent.

  2.  An alternative use for the syringe is to pretend to shoot up while a
teacher is watching.  If they speak to you tell them you have to do it because
school is so horrible.

  3.  Call the school and leave the phone off the hook.  The way some (but not
all) phone systems work this will tie up their phone for as long as yours is
off
the hook.

  4.  Protest U.S.  aid to reactionary regimes abroad by defoliating plants
around the school or by digging a bomb crater on the front lawn.  When the
ecology freaks complain, ask them where they were when the U.S.  was doing the
same thing to Indochina.

  5.  Draw or paste something "obscene" on pull-down wall maps or movie
screens.

  6.  Get some of the punch cards that your school uses for taking attendance.
Punch new holes in them either with a keypunch machine or a screwdriver. Then
switch the cards with others wherever they are stored.  If you can figure out
the code the cards are punched by this has even more possibilities.  You can
often be just as effective without actually repunching the cards by
redistributing them a few days after you collect them (particularly when
they're
used for attendence).

  7.  Start an information service to let new students voice their opinions
and
warnings about the teachers and administrators before enrollment day.

  8.  Bad food?  Have a good old fashioned food riot.

  9.  In gym classes or in hallways between classes have massive searches
for "lost" contact lenses telling people not to walk through the hall or "you
might step on it".

  10.  If your school still has a dress code, protest it, having everyone do
something disruptive that does not violate the code.  For example, dye your
hair
green with food coloring.

  11.  Free all the animals in the biology classroom.

  12.  Write a "consumer report" on the "education" you've been consuming.
Distribute it to parents at school functions.

  13. Periodically have students go to the office to have some rumor confirmed
or denied.

  14.  Perform citizen's arrests of administrators for destroying the minds of
youths, then telephone the police to come and take the criminals into custody.
(This would be an excellent guerilla theatre action.)

  15.  Rip off dishes and silverware from the cafeteria, towels from the gym,
stencils and paper from the duplicating room, layout equipment from the art
and
drafting departments, tools from the wood shop, and light bulbs from the
sockets.  Give them to a needy movement group.

  16.  During lunch turn on and light all the gas jets in the science labs.

  17.  Demand to see your school records on file.  (Everyone can see them.)

  18.  You can make a very effective fuse by inserting a non-filter cigarette
in
a book of matches so that it touches the head of some matches and will ignite
them when it burns down that far.  Then loosly crumple paper around the
matches
and cigarettes so that they are hidden.  Toss it in a wastebasket or any other
area with a lot of papers, preferably in the office.  It takes 5 minutes to
ignite...  By then you can be on the other side of the building. Practice this
at home before trying it.

  19.  Have giant coughing or sneezing epidemics in class or study hall.

  20.  Rub lipstick, glue, or vaseline onto the doorknobs of the school's
administrative offices.

  21.  Swallow some snake bite antidote.  Then walk into the principal's
office.
 The antidote (most types are harmless, make sure you get that kind) will make
you vomit.  Do so all over his carpet, desk, clothing, etc.  Then apologize
profusely.

  22.  Pick up some dog training liquid at any pet store.  It smells like
concentrated urine.  And if you can't figure out what to do with that then you
shouldn't be reading this.

  23.  Remove contents of teacher's mailboxes.  Print up everything that's
confidential or interesting.

  24.  Leave notes and hints that "Tuesday's the day".

  25.  Impersonate parental voices and make irritant phone calls to the
office.

  26.  Make a super stink bomb out of hydrogen sulfide and put somewhere in
the
ventilating system.  This has cleared school buildings for days.

  27.  If your school has a suspended ceiling, (that is a ceiling composed of
rectangles or squares resting on a frame so that the rectangles can be pushed
up) you can put a dead fish -- or anything else -- above them.  Or put it into
empty lockers and glue them shut.

  28.  Put signs on your locker saying "This locker will self-destruct if
opened
for inspection".

  29.  Give your school library a subscription to a good underground newspaper
from your area and insist that they make it available to students.

  30.  Print up false notices frequently using the same format as the school
uses and distribute them to the teachers' mailboxes.  Eventually they'll never
know what to believe.

  31.  Make your own passes, forms, tickets, etc.  Or lift them out of
teachers'
desks.

  32.  Need a signature?  Collect things that have teachers' signatures on
them.
 Paste them all down on a sheet of white paper and either xerox or print up a
bunch of copies.  Forge when useful.  When getting started you might put a
piece
of carbon paper under the signature with the carbon paper facing down on what
you want signed. Then trace over the name with a steady relaxed hand. Practice
makes perfect.

  33.  Do some revolutionary wall painting.  All you need is a can of spray
paint (red?) plus a little imagination and courage.  Then write your favorite
slogans on walls, sidewalks, blackboards, etc.  If you are a perfectionist you
can make a stencil, But that limits the size of what you can do.  Wear gloves
or
you will certainly get tell-tale paint on your spraying finger.

  34.  Are certain teachers or administrators misbehaving?  Print up a rat
sheet
with their names and telephone numbers and distribute it.  Now students can
call
up at any time and reprimand them...  3.00 a.m.  for example.  Also you could
order them pizzas, plumbers...  Think big!

  35.  Break into your school at night and burn it down.  To get inside you
can
either hide in the building during the day and wait until the janitor leaves
(know in advance what time that is) or come in later at night and either force
your way through the door, find an open window, or break a window.  If you use
the latter method do it a few hours or days in advance so you don't get caught
if it attracts attention.  Be careful not to leave fingerprints.  Wear gloves
all the time if possible.  Once inside make sure the walls will light well by
placing loose paper or wood around them, or squirting lighter fluid, kerosene,
or gasoline onto them.  If alot of burnable boxes are stacked in one area,
spread them around.  Start the fire from the inside of the building so it will
take longer before it can be seen from the windows.  Make sure the fire has a
way to travel from one burnable area to another.  Of course you should wear
dark
clothes and know exactly where you are going when you split.

  36.  Get hold of a film to be shown at a school assembly and splice in parts
of another movie of your own choosing before the assembly.  A little
imagination
on your part will make for an unforgettable day.

  37.  Clog up the drains of sinks with clay then turn on the water after
everyone leaves school.

  38.  Teachers often leave gradebooks, conduct sheets, and attendance records
unguarded.  Take every chance to help yourself.

  39.  Put up posters all around the school.  To make them stick permanently
use
wet evaporated milk for glue.

  40.  You could ice-pick tires as a warning...  But make sure you have a
total
enemy before you put sugar in their gas tank.

  41.  Start wailing in the halls.

  42.  If you can't find any skunks, let chickens loose in the school, or
pigeons.

  43.  Create the "web of thread" in
your classroom.  Have everybody in your class bring a spool of thread, with
extras for people who forget.  Tie your thread onto something and pass the
spools around till you run out, winding thread around everything.  It is best
to
pick on one of your more dullwitted teachers for this one.  Explain that you
did
it in the name of art.

  44.  Carry and pretend to sell oregano rolled in papers and aspirin with the
name filed off.

  45.  Put calcium carbide (available in some parts of the country as
"gopher-go".  Also available in some hobby and joke shops) in a gelatin
capsule
and flush down a toilet or sink. Calcium carbide reacts violently with water,
quickly producing large amounts of gas and bursting pipes, etc. as soon as the
water disolves the capsule.

  46. Ride a bicycle down a busy hall.

  47.  Save your book reports and essays.  Give them to other students to use
next year or re-use them yourself with different teachers.

  48.  Play with lighting and microphone controls during "important"
assemblies.

  49.  Flush things down the toilets (preferably faculty johns) like balloons
filled with air, baseballs, M80's, huge amounts of toilet paper, etc. Then
build
an ark.

  50.  Start a campaign to have the letter Z appear everywhere as the mark of
angry students.

  51.  You can short-circuit the school's wiring by taking a regular plug with
a
short cord attached.  Connect the two wires with a switch between them. Plug
it
in, turn the switch on, and you've blown a fuse.  Turn it off.  Pull it out
and
try another.  You don't have to use the switch, but if you don't sometimes the
current will arc and weld the plug to the socket.

  52.  Set up a fake school and hire away the lousy teachers - or put up
notices
inviting the entire school to a going away party for a teacher who isn't
really
leaving.

  53.  Read the school budget. Reprint and distribute a list of the stupid
expenditures.

  54.  Take booze to lunch in a thermos and pass it around.

  55.  During some important test (SAT, ACT, etc.) on each subject have some
student who is good at that subject stand up and read the correct answers for
as
long as possible.  When they're finished or silenced have someone else stand
up
and do the same thing.  The test results will be worthless and it will have to
be given over at great cost to the school.

  56.  Take down the American flag in front of the school and put up one of
your
own.  The best way to do this is to lower the flag that's already up, replace
it
with your flag and cut the rope about a foot below where the flag is attached.
Then tie a slip knot around the other end of the rope that is hanging down to
raise the flag.  At this point there is no way your flag can be lowered
without
someone climbing up the flagpole.

  57.  Put alarm clocks in various lockers set on "loudest".  Set the alarm
clocks so they will go off about every 10 minutes then close and lock the
lockers.

  58.  Have a group of people march around the school with a flag singing the
star spangled banner.  If the administration tries to punish you telephone
your
local radio stations and patriotic groups and complain that your school is
being
run by pinkos.

  59.  In a class where there is a rule against chewing gum have everyone blow
a
bubble at the same time one day.

  60.  Many schools have automatic sprinkler systems which go off
automatically
when sensors in the ceiling feel too much heat.  Find the sensors and hold up
a
match to them.

  61.  Persuade the graduating class to use their senior gift money for
something useful or subversive.

  62.  Reprint the "Schoolstoppers Textbook" in your underground paper or on a
leaflet or buy bulk copies and pass them around.

  63.  Demand that all equipment being stored rather than being used be made
available to students.

  64.  If your school won't have a teacher evaluation, make up some forms and
do
it yourself.  Compile the result and publicize them to students, faculty,
school
board, and community.

  65.  Use your "free choice" book reports, term papers, etc.  to read
revolutionary literature and further the political education of you and your
class.

  66.  Have a student lie on the ground.  When a teacher comes, scream, "He
jumped!" and point to the roof or third floor window.  Mumble, "Fred dared
him,"
or, "maybe it was LSD."

  67.  Make an address list of disliked adults in your school. Answer sex ads
for them - or order them a few gross items (C.O.D.  of course).

  68.  Toss handfuls of BBs on the floors of busy halls, assemblies,
graduation
ceremonies, weddings, funerals.

  69.  Steal cafeteria trays or plates. Burn large holes in them and turn them
into the school washer saying, "I guess the food did it".

  70.  Leave phony letters of resignation from teachers or administrators on
the
principal's desk.

  71.  Get a small group to always carry screwdrivers and slowly dismantle the
school.

  72.  Lots of bomb scares tend to break up the boredom especially during
exams
or on beautiful days.

  73.  Photograph teachers and administrators constantly...  even without
film.

  74.  If you've got the nerve, urinate in your pants while giving an oral
report.

  75.  Splice into your school's intercom system (from a remote hidden spot).
Now you have your own guerrilla radio station.  Play on!

  76.  Drop large bottles of ether in science class.

  77.  Hang your teacher!  Hang a hangman's noose from a tree.  Make a dummy
and
hang the dummy from the noose. Pin notes on it like "Weatherbee in '73". To
add
realism put holes in the body. Then let dilute ketchup trickle down.

  78.  Newspaper stands in buildings are usually left unguarded.  Take out
papers and replace with rotten comics or papers.

  79.  Put a rotten apple or stale sandwich on teacher's desk.

  80.  If your school intercom has phones that connect into the intercom
switchboard, put a small magnet either where the cord comes out of the handset
or in the part where you hear.  If the intercom just has a speaker, put the
magnet near or on one of the electrical connections of the speaker. In either
case it will short out the system.  It may take weeks for them to find the
trouble.

  81.  Take the door of the administration offices off its hinges but leave it
standing there so that when the principal tries to open the door in the
morning
it will have a slightly crushing effect.


Hmm.  Someone miscounted somewhere!... There were supposed to be 83!
Really!...

%                                                                            #

%   You will need the following items:                                       #
% 1) 8-10 bungi sticks about 7 inches long each                              #
%[Note]: Bungi sticks are just sticks that have one end sharpened to a point.#
%        If you want to get fancy 1-1/2 inch dowel works great!              #
% 2) A shovel                                                                #
% 3) A victim                                                                #

%    First off pick a spot where the victim will walk that is soft ground or #
% dirt. Then proceed to dig a hole about 2-3 feet deep and about 2 feet in   #
% diameter. Once the hole is dug take the bungi sticks and line the hole with#
% them so that they are pointing downward at an angle like this:             #
%       hole wall--> !\ <--bungi stick--> /! <--hole wall                    #
%                    !\                   /!                                 #
%                    !---------------------!                                 #
%   Cover the hole to match the ground cover (use twigs and leaves with      #
% dirt or whatever matches on top) and find a nice hiding spot. When the     #
% victim steps into the hole the stakes will do nothing to him but maybe snag#
% his pants, but when he trys to remove his foot he will be going against the#
% stakes and they will drive into his ankle...                               #
% [P.S.]-For a nice touch you could also put the stakes on the hole floor... #
%                                                                            #

%   To make this trap work you must have access inside the victims house and #
% it helps if you don't like them very much. To start go into the kitchen or #
% where ever your mom keeps her ammonia, and put some in a sealable container#
% that it won't eat through. Next, aquire a medical syringe. Go to the house #
% of the victim and get into a room by yourself. Go to the nearest lamp or   #
% light fixture that has a light bulb in it and remove the light bulb. Fill  #
% the syringe with the ammonia and make a small puncture in the light bulb.  #
% It may sound impossible but it's actually pretty easy. Once you have the   #
% the ammonia touching the filament in the light bulb stop injecting and re- #
% place the bulb. Leave the room and try and stay out of there until the     #
% light is turned on. When it is turned on the red hot filament and the      #
% ammonia do all sorts of fun stuff!!....Have fun,    Anselot The Slayer     #

         Disclaimer: This stuff is DANGEROUS!!! This file is for information
purposes only and is not to be thought of as an endorsement for the making of
this blasting gelignite. If you do make it and blow your face (head, arms,
legs, feet, hands, etc.) off you deserve it because this stuff is just
downright dangerous!! (I have a friend who had some blow up in his face and he
has nice third degree burns all over his face which means fun stuff like skin
grafts, etc.)

 The Best Blasting Gelignite..

     To try and tell you about the potency and danger of this stuff, I want
you to know that one time some friends of mine and I (Disk Slasher, Romper
Stomper) were very careful and made some of this stuff. After it was made, we
were scared as shit of it and carried it on a ten foot pole. (literally!)
Near to my house there is a club that has a Coke machine outside. So we went
over there at about 3 in the morning and stuck this stuff all over the Coke
Machine and set it off. The whole Coke Machine damn near split in two (well
anyway the front door was blown off) and the Cokes and money came spilling out
We helped ourselves to both and got the hell out of there which was good
because the police and fire department were there in about 15 minutes because
all the people around that the blast had waken up had called them because they
thought there was a fire or something. So if you make this stuff (Which we
don't endorse you doing) BE CAREFUL!!!!!!

 The Best Blasting Gelignite..

     The Recipe:

     Note: None of these items are too hard to get but you damn well better
not think that this stuff is not powerful because of that. if you think that,
you had better get prepared to lose part of your body.

     Further Note: A step marked with a star '*' should be done behind a blast
shield of some kind. We used a big sheet of plexiglas.

         Stuff you need

         1) 50 parts water
         2) 20 parts sugar (provides oxygen)
         3)  1 part  baking soda
         4)  5 parts Corn Flakes (I'm not kidding, this is VITAL as a
                                  stabilizing agent)
         5) 30 parts Charcoal (Very finely ground Fishtank charcoal- No
                               Barbeque charcoal)
         6) 10 parts Sulphur (You can sometimes get this at grocery stores
                              [especially Kroger] in the drug section)
         7) 30 parts Saltpetre (You can also get this at grocery stores
                                sometimes. Kroger is the only one I know of
                                but ther might be others. get it in the drug
                                section.)
         8) A Jar of Vaseline


     The Actions...

       1) Get a deep metal pan to cook over the stove on and put the water in
          it. Stir in the sugar until it all dissolves. if you can't get all
          of the sugar to dissolve, add more water until all of the sugar has
          dissolved. Now stir in the baking soda until it dissolves. if you
          can't get all of the baking soda to dissolve, don't worry about it,
          just leave it.

       2) Heat the pan over a medium flame (You don't need to stir) until it
          begins to boil. Now stir in the corn flakes until they are all in
          water and the whole thing begins to look like hot breakfast cereal.
          let the mixture sit on the burner until it begins to boil again.
          (This could be a long time or it could be a very short time
          depending on the water and the elevation, etc.)

       3) As soon as the mixture begins to boil, stir it constantly until it
          is a sludgy mass that is sort of half solid and half liquid.

       4) Now dump this mixture out onto a greased cookie pan (so it dosen't
          stick) It should be just solid enough to almost stay in a lump. Now
          mix in the Charcoal and the Sulphur. If it gets really gritty, don't
          worry. Just mix it together as well as you can. Now stick in the
          oven at 150 degrees. Make sure that is 150 degrees. if it is much
          higher, this stuff will burn up in your oven and take your whole
          house with it. Constantly monitor the pan until all of the sludge
          is baked dry and has no wetness in it at all.

     * 5) Get the pan out of the oven when it is ready and  put it in the
          refrigerator or let it cool down by itself (The refrigerator is
          faster). Now take it out of the pan and pound it into dust. This
          might need to be done behind a blast shield because even though I
          have heard that it can't blow up or burn up if it is cool at this
          stage, When I pounded up my batch I made some sparks and so I got
          a blast shield just in case.

     * 6) When you have the dust. put it in a tupperware or something like
          that and put it, the saltpetre, and the vaseline in the fridge until
          they are all cold. This definately needs to be done behind a blast
          shield as this is the part where it gets very unstable. Get a cooler
          and fill it with ice and put an open container in the ice but don't
          let ice get in the container. Mix all of the dust and saltpetre
          together. Get a big glob of vaseline and get it
          nice and soft and quickly mix as much of the dust into
          it as you can. If the mixture get above about 35 degrees Celcius, it
          will blow up so try to not keep it in your hands too long (I
          definately advise wearing gloves to keep your hands from heating the
          mixture.) When you have mixed all of the dust possible
          into the lump of vaseline, drop it into the container in the cooler
          and get some more vaseline and make a new lump. When all of the dust
          is gone, close the container and put it in the fridge. When you want
          it to blow up (And it will blow up big!) just get it hot. We did
          both by sticking firecrackers in it and lighting them and running
          like hell (Very Dangerous!) and by model rocket ignition system
          model rocket igniters which we stuck in the stuff.


     If you are crazy and stupid enough to do this, then watch out! it is a
good way to hurt yourself.

                Car Phun

           BY: System Crusher

Ok you real sick bastards so your so
called friend screwed you right so do
we get mad??? Of course not JUST EVEN!!
Now say he just got a car or has a good
one as it is gee let's see what phun
we can have with it:

FLAME THROWER
=============

Take a cup of gas and poor it down the
exahuast pipe when the dude starts it
**POOF** he has a 30 foot flame thrower
Now that doesnt do anything thats just
to make the guy shit in his pants.

PRETTY DESIGNS
==============

Ok now take his windshield wiper and
attach some tacks to it Gee what
pretty designs they leave on the car
window when he turns then on.
lets see:

HOT HAND
========

Ok now you got this dick for a teacher
so it's 9th period and you see him or
her in the office or something. You go
over to their car and heat the handle
with a lighter till its practically red
then wait...When you hear a "Shit!" you
know you did it right and you get a good
laugh out of it..(HEHEHE)

POTATO TRICK
============

Just take your average potato and stuff
it in someones exhaust pipe.The car
wont start if there somewhere else
they will have to get it towed.If there
stupid they will have to ask a mechanic
Ok they will probably have to go to a
mechanic and ask to get it out boy
wont they ever look stupid! and cost
them $$$$$ or a pain in the ass to do
it themselves..

Nitro triodide
==============

I saw a message on this its the ammonia
and iodine mixture well you take the
shit and smear it on the tire treads and
when he pulls out **BOOM**.

WAYS TO HAVE A CHEAP THRILL... AT THE EXPENSE OF LAW-ABIDING AMERICAN
CITIZENS:

1) ORDER A BB MACHINE GUN.  THEY GO FOR ABOUT $10 IF YOU SHOP AROUND, AND ARE
CAPABLE OF WREAKING TOTAL HAVOC.  THEY CAN HOLD AROUND 1000 BB'S, ARE LIGHT-
WEIGHT (PLASTIC, PVC) COME WITH SHOULDER STOCK, AND CAN BE POWERED WITH A
STANDARD FREON CAN, OR COMPRESSOR.

2) ASSEMBLE SOME HOME-BREW MX MISSILES.  GO OUT AND BUY A DOZEN SMALL ESTES
ROCKETS - ONE STAGE, NO CHUTE NECESSARY (NOSE CONE SHOULD BE REMOVABLE) AND
PREFERABLY ONE WITH A HOLLOW, PLASTIC NOSE PIECE.  THEY COST AROUND 3 DOLLARS
A THROW.  ARM THESE WITH M-80'S (OR ANY OTHER DEATH DEVICE) TIGHTLY PACKED
IN THE NOSE CONE.  USE A C-ENGINE WITH A FUSE OR ELECTRIC LAUNCHER.  THE KICK-
BACK FROM THE ENGINE SHOULD, IF THE BODY IS SHORT AND YOU DON'T USE WADDING,
IGNITE THE FUSE.  I'VE FOUND BEST SPORT IS TO FIRE THESE BUGGERS AT PASSING
BOATS AND SHIPS FROM THE WEST SIDE (DESERTED) ELEVATED HIGHWAY AT NIGHT.
USE ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FOR OPTIMUM BANG-FOR-THE-BUCK.

3) ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO TO A PHONE BOOTH WITH A WHITE PAGES BOOK
ATTACHED TO IT, IS TO USE A TORCH TO MELT THE BACK OF THE HANDSET AND WELD IT
TO THE PLASTIC COVER OF THE BOOK.

4) PHONE PHUN - IF YOU ARE BORED OF CHEATING GM EXECS OUT OF DOUGH BY USING
THEIR ACCOUNTS ON TRAVEL NET AND CALLING OUTER MONGOLIA, TRY SOME >REAL<
PHONE PHUN.  BE IMAGINATIVE.  ASK KEDORG ABOUT THE TIME HE GOT A WOMAN TO
CUT OFF HER PHONE'S GREEN (RECEIVING) WIRE... HE EVEN HAS A TAPE OF THE
SESSION
THE NICE THING ABOUT PHONE PHUN IS THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY ALMOST FREE.  YOU
CAN ALSO DO SOME AWESOME STUFF IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE LINES.  TRY CALLING DIAL
A PRAYER AND CONNECTING IT WITH SOME POOR SLOB.  HE'LL THINK DIAL A PRAYER
MADE THE CALL.... OR IF YOU WANNA SEE FEATHERS FLY, AND CHICKENS SQUABBLE,
CALL TWO OPERATORS AND PATCH 'EM IN TOGETHER.

5) BB GUN FUN - IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BB GUN WITH A SCOPE, YOU CAN DO SOME
AMAZING DAMAGE.  I HAVE A CROSSMAN 766 WITH A BUSHNELL 4X SCOPE WHICH ALLOWS
ME TO USE .177 CAL. PELLETS, OR 5 BB ROUNDS SHOT-GUN STYLE.  KILLING
PIGEONS IS FUN.

WHAT WAS I UP TO? 6? ANYWAY, A GOOD BB GUN WITH PELLETS AT 650-700 FPS CAN
KNOCK
OUT A GOOD PLATE WINDOW FROM 100 YARDS OR SO.  DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF POINT
THE PELLET HAS, YOU CAN MAKE PUNCTURE HOLES, OR SMASH THE ENTIRE WINDOW.

8) WRIST ROCKETS - OK, SO YOU'RE TOO CHEAP TO BUY A RIFLE... THEN GO OUT AND
GET
A WRIST ROCKET.  ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS POWERFUL, THEY CAN BE
EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED AS TERROR INSTRUMENTS.  IF YOU'RE STRONG, YOU CAN KNOCK
OUT
MOST NORMAL WINDOWS AT 100 YARDS.  SEE IF YOU CAN KNOCK OUT A BUS WINDOW... I
SWEAR TO GOD, THOSE NEW GM BUSES HAVE WINDOWS MADE OF TITANIUM OR SOMETHING.

8) YOU CAN WREAK MUCH HAVOC OFF A GOOD ROOF AS WELL.  ASK MR. DEATH ABOUT
THAT!
IN GENERAL, YOU WANT TO BE ON AS HIGH A ROOF AS POSSIBLE WHICH WILL ALLOW
ACCURATE BOMBARDMENT.  THIS WAY, ESPECIALLY IF THE BUILDING HAS SEVERAL APTS.
AND TERRACES, YOUR TARGET WILL BE UNABLE TO LOCATE YOU.  FIREWORKS DROPPED
FROM
ROOVES IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING.  EGGING IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO PASS SOME TIME
TOO.  DURING PARADES AND SHIT YOU CAN REALLY WREAK TREMENDOUS DISRUPTION BY
THROWING EGGS BY THE DOZEN INTO THE CROWD.  THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN
WAS MR. DEATH EGGING A WOMAN IN THE WEST VILLAGE HALLOWEEN PARADE WHO DRESSED
AS
A CLOWN... THE EGG JUST LANDED ON HER TECHNICOLOR AFRO-WIG AND SHOWERED HER.

9) PIGEON FUN - THIS IS REALLY A SEPARATE CATAGORY FOR YOU PIGEON DIE-HARDS
OUT
THERE.  I MENTIONED PLUGGING THEM WITH BB'S... YOU CAN ALSO TRY: TYING THEIR
LEGS TOGETHER... JUST WATCH THES TRY TO LAND ON A LEDGE; TYING M-80S TO THEIR
FEET... WHAT A TRIP!  TYING STRING AROUND THEIR BODY SO THEY CAN'T USE THEIR
WINGS AND DROPPING THEM OFF A BUILDING, AND MY ALL TIME FAVORITE, STRAPPING
THEM
TO AN ESTES HOME-BREW MX MISSILE, AND WATCHING THE FEATHERS FLY.

10) FLY FUN - THIS IS MY LATEST HOBBY.  MY HOUSE WAS RECENTLY INVADED BY A
SWORM
OF SICKLY HUGE (I MEAN >HUGE<) FLIES, AND I HAVE BEEN DEVISING CONSTRUCT- IVE
WAYS OF TERMINATING THEM... AND I HAVE COME UP WITH SEVERAL EFFECTIVE AND
ENTERTAINING MEANS. MY FAVORITE WAY IS TO SHOOT THEM WITH RUBBER BANDS (THICK,
STRONG).  REMEMBER TO HAVE A VACUUM HANDY THOUGH, SINCE THEY USUALLY BREAK UP
INTO ITY-BITY PIECES.  TRY SWATTING THEM IN MID-AIR.  IF YOU HIT THEM HARD
ENOUGH, YOU CAN HEAR THEM GO "CLICK" AND SAIL ACROSS THE ROOM... THEM FIND
THEM
AND DISPOSE OF THEM.  ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU FIND THEM AND THEY ARE ONLY
STUNNED,
TAKE A SPOOL OF THREAD AND TIE THE END AROUND ITS NECK.  LEAVE THE SPOOL WITH
SOME SLACK IN A VISIBLE PLACE, AND YOU HAVE AN INSTANT CONVERSATION PIECE! 
JUST
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL THINK!  THIS IS NOT ADVISABLE WITH NYC FLIES...
YOU WILL PROBABLY CONTRACT A TERRIBLE DISEASE AND DIE A FIERY DEATH.  FLY'S
REVENGE.

WELL, THAT'S IT FOR NOW.  GO OUT AND HAVE SOME REAL FUN.  WHO NEEDS TO PLAY
SPY HUNTER OR GALAXIAN WHEN YOU CAN WREAK >TRUE< HAVOC AROUND YOUR BLOCK?
I'LL BE BACK WITH THE LATEST IN FALL FUN NEXT TIME, ON EVERYONE'S FAVORITE
SHOW ---- CAPTAIN CRASH AND THE DEATH SQUADS OF THE COMMUNIST MUTANT WORLD!

    CHEMICAL IGNITERS FROM THE BOOK:

THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND BY KURT SAXON

CHEMICAL DELAY IGNITERS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN POPULAR WITH THE MORE VERSITILE
MILITANTS. THE MOST COMMON SUCH IGNITER
IS THE SULFURIC ACID-POTASSIUM CHLORATE
AND SUGER GOODY.

THE IGNITER IS A MIXTURE OF HALF
POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND HALF GRANULATED
SUGAR. IT BURSTS INTO FLAME WITH THE
APPLICATION OF A DROP OF SULFURIC ACID.

THE IDEA IS TO PUT SOME OF THE MIXTURE
INTO A GLASS OR PLASTIC TUBE AND THEN
STUFF IN SOME COTTON, OR PAPER. SOME
ACID IS THEN PUT INTO THE TUBE WITH A
MEDICINE DROPPER, BOUGHT AT A DRUG OR
HOBBY STORE.

THE ACID IS SUPPOSED TO SEEP SLOWLY
THROUGH THE BARRIER AND FINALLY IGNITE
THE MIXTURE. THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS
SYSTEM IS THAT IT OFTEN DOESN'T WORK OR
IT WORKS TOO FAST.

WHEN SULFURIC ACID EATS THROUGH
VEGATABLE MATTER THERE IS A REACTION OF
GREAT HEAT. THIS IS OFTEN ENOUGH TO
BREAK THE GLASS TUBINGOR MELT A PLASTIC
DRINKING STRAW AND CAN STOP THE ACTION
RIGHT THERE.

IF THE GLASS TUBING HOLDS, THE ACID
STILLL LOSES ITS POTENCY AS IT REACTS
WITH THE VEGATABLE MATTER AND THAT
WHICH REACHES THJE MIXTURE MAY BE TOO
WEAK.

THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN,
HOWEVER, IS THAT IT WILL WORK TOO FAST.
THE ACID CAN EAT THROUGH THE BARRIER IN
SECONDS INSTEAD OF THE MINUTES YOU
THINK YOU HAVE.

THIS COULD BE DISASTROUS IF YOU
LOITERED IN THE AREA FOR A MINUTE TO
AVOID LOOKING SUSPICIOUS. IF YOU ARMED
THE DEVICE BEFORE GOING INTO THE TARGET
AREA, YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN GET THERE.

TO AVOID SUCH HANGUPS YOU SHOULD USE
A NON-REACTIVE BARRIER SUCH AS ASBESTOS
FIBERS, BOUGHT FROM ANY BUILDING SUPPLY
STORE. THE ACID WILL SEEP THROUGH THE
ASBESTOS FIBERS, MAKING HEAT AND WITH-
OUT LOSING ITS POTENCY. AND SINCE IT
DOESN'T EAT THE ASBESTOS, IT CAN BE
TIMED WITH MUCH MORE CERTAINTY, WHICH
MAKES IT SAFER AND MORE SURE.

POWDERED HIGHWAY6 FLARE IGNITER CAN BE
SUBSTITUTED FOR THE POTASSIUM
CHLORATE-SUGAR MIXTURE.  IT IS OVER
HALF POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND IS SIMPLER.
IN FACT, IF THJE PLASTIC STRAW IS
PUSHED OVER A FUSE COATED WITH FLARE
IGNITER, THE FUSE NEEDS NO OTHER IGNITE
R.

ANOTHER CHEMICAL IGNITION DEVICE USES
GLYCERINE TO REACT WITH POTASSIUM
PERMANGANATE. POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE
IS A RELATIVELY STABLE OXYGENATOR AND
CAN EASILY BE BOUGHT AT THE DRUG STORE.
IT IS ALSO USED FOR STAINING MICROSCOPE
SPECIMENS, DISINFECTING FISH TANKS.

THE POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE IS GROUND TO
A POWDER AND MIXED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT
OF FUSE POWDER AND MIXED WITH THE SAME
AMOUNT OF FUSE POWDER OR THE HIGHWAY
FLARE IGNITER. COTTEN CAN BE USED AS A
BARRIER AS IT DOESN'T REACT WITH
GLYCERINE.

AT LEAST AN INCH OF GLYCERINE IS PUT
INTO THE TUBE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU USE A
BARRIER. WHEN IT REACHES THE MIXTURE
IT TAKES FROM THREE TO FIVE MINUTES FOR
THE IGNITION TO TAKE PLACE.

IF THE IGNITER IS POTASSIUM CHLORATE
AND SUGAR OR FLARE IGNITER OR POTASSIUM
PERMANGANATE, IT NEEDS A BARRIER TO
KEEP IT IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THE FIRE
TRAIN BURNS PAST THJE BARRIER TO THE
FUSE, THJE BARRIER SHOULD BE FLAMMABLE.
TO MAKE MATERIAL FOR THIS BARRIER, MIX
COTTEN WITH WET FUSE POWDER OR FLARE
IGNITER.  THEN DRY IT AND PULL OFF
PINCHES AS NEEDED.

TO ARM THESE DEVICES A MEDICINE
DROPPER FILLED WITH ACID OR GLYCERINE
CAN BE CARRIED UP-ENDED IN A TEST TUBE
IN THE SHIRT POCKET. A PLASTIC FELT-TIP
MARKER WITH A CLIP TO HOLD IT UPRIGHT
IN THJE POCKET CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF
THE TEST TUBE.  IT IS SIMPLY HOLLOWED
OUT AND THE DROPPER FITS IN NICELY.

TO AVOID BURNED FINGERS, A STRING IS
TIED TO THE DROPPER SO IT CAN BE
PULLED OUT OF THE CONTAINER.







The Chemist's Corner
Article #1: Explosives
By Zaphod Beeblebrox/MPG

     This article deals with the instructions for creating some dangerous
explosives. If you intend to make any of these explosives, do so in SMALL
AMOUNTS ONLY, as they are all dangerous and could seriously injure or kill you
if done in larger amounts. If you don't know anything about chemistry, DON'T
DO
THESE EXPERIMENTS! I am not joking in giving this warning. Unless you have a
death wish, you shouldn't try any of the following unless you have had prior
experience with chemicals.

     I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this
information. It is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who
are
interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.

==============================================================================
=


I. Common "weak" explosives.

 A. Gunpowder:

     75% Potassium Nitrate
     15% Charcoal
     10% Sulfur

      The chemicals should be ground into a fine powder (seperately!) with a
morter & pestle. If gunpowder is ignited in the open, it burns fiercely, but
if
in a closed space it builds up pressure from the released gases and can
explode
the container. Gunpowder works like this: the potassium nitrate oxidizes the
charcoal and sulfur, which then burn fiercely. Carbon dioxide and sulfur
dioxide
are the gases released.

 B. Ammonal:

     Ammonal is a mixture of ammonium nitrate (a strong oxidizer) with
aluminum
powder (the 'fuel' in this case). I am not sure of the % composition for
Ammonal, so you may want to experiment a little using small amounts.

 C. Chemically ignited explosives:

  1. A mixture of 1 part potassium chlorate to 3 parts table sugar (sucrose)
burns fiercely and brightly (similar to the burning of magnesium) when 1 drop
of
concentrated sulfuric acid is placed on it. What occurs is this: when the acid
is added it reacts with the potassium chlorate to form chlorine dioxide, which
explodes on formation, burning the sugar as well.

  2. Using various chemicals, I have developed a mixture that works very well
for imitating volcanic eruptions. I have given it the name 'MPG Volcanite'
(tm).
Here it is: potassium chlorate + potassium perchlorate + ammonium nitrate +
ammonium dichromate + potassium nitrate + sugar + sulfur + iron filings +
charcoal + zinc dust + some coloring agent. (scarlet= strontium nitrate,
purple=
iodine crystals, yellow= sodium chloride, crimson= calcium chloride, etc...).
  3. So, do you think water puts out fires? In this one, it starts it.
Mixture:
ammonium nitrate + ammonium chloride + iodine + zinc dust. When a drop or two
of water is added, the ammonium nitrate forms nitric acid which reacts with
the
zinc to produce hydrogen and heat. The heat vaporizes the iodine (giving off
purple smoke) and the ammonium chloride (becomes purple when mixed with iodine
vapor). It also may ignite the hydrogen and begin burning.

     Ammonium nitrate: 8 grams
     Ammonium choride: 1 gram
     Zinc dust: 8 grams
     Iodine crystals: 1 gram

  4. Potassium permanganate + glycerine when mixed produces a purple-colored
flame in 30 secs-1 min. Works best if the potassium permanganate is finely
ground.

  5. Calcium carbide + water releases acetylene gas (highly flammable gas used
in blow torches...)

II. Thermite reaction.

  The Thermite reaction is used in welding, because it generates molten iron
and temperatures of 3500 C (6000F+). It uses one of the previous reactions
that
I talked about to START it!

  Starter=potassium chlorate + sugar
  Main pt.= iron (III) oxide + aluminum powder (325 mesh or finer)

    Put the potassium chlorate + sugar around and on top of the main pt. To
start the reaction, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid on top of the
starter mixture. STEP BACK! The ratios are: 3 parts iron (III) oxide to 1 part
aluminum powder to 1 part potassium chlorate to 1 part sugar. When you first
do
it, try 3g:1g:1g:1g! Also, there is an alternative starter for the Thermite
reaction. The alternative is potassium permanganate + glycerine. Amounts: 55g
iron (III) oxide, 15g aluminum powder, 25g potassium permanganate, 6ml
glycerine.

III. Nitrogen-containing high explosives.

  A. Mercury(II) Fulminate

      To produce Mercury(II) Fulminate, a very sensitive shock explosive, one
might assume that it could be formed by adding Fulminic acid to mercury. This
is
somewhat difficult since Fulminic acid is very unstable and cannot be
purchased.
I did some research and figured out a way to make it without fulminic acid.
You
add 2 parts nitric acid to 2 parts alcohol to 1 part mercury. This is
theoretical (I have not yet tried it) so please, if you try this, do it in
very
small amounts and tell me the results.

  B. Nitrogen Triiodide

      Nitrogen Triiodide is a very powerful and very shock sensitive
explosive.
Never store it and be careful when you're around it- sound, air movements, and
other tiny things could set it off.

Materials-

   2-3g Iodine
   15ml conc. ammonia
   8 sheets filter paper
   50ml beaker
   feather mounted on a two meter pole
   ear plugs
   tape
   spatula
   stirring rod

  Add 2-3g Iodine to 15ml ammonia in the 50ml beaker. Stir, let stand for 5
minutes.

DO THE FOLLOWING WITHIN 5 MINUTES!

   Retain the solid, decant the liquid (pour off the liquid but keep the brown
solid...). Scape the brown residue of Nitrogen Triiodide onto a stack of four
sheets of filter paper. Divide solid into four parts, putting each on a
seperate
sheet of dry filter paper. Tape in position, leave to dry undisturbed for AT
LEAST 30 minutes (preferrably longer). To detonate, touch with feather. (WEAR
EAR PLUGS WHEN DETONATING OR COVER EARS- IT IS VERY LOUD!)

  C. Cellulose Nitrate (Guncotton)

       Commonly known as Smokeless powder, Nitrocellulose is exactly that- it
does not give off smoke when it burns.

Materials-
  70ml concentrated sulfuric acid
  30ml concentrated nitric acid
  5g absorbent cotton
  250ml 1M sodium bicarbonate
  250ml beaker
  ice bath
  tongs
  paper towels

    Place 250ml beaker in the ice bath, add 70ml sulfuric acid, 30 ml nitric
acid. Divide cotton into .7g pieces. With tongs, immerse each piece in the
acid
solution for 1 minute. Next, rinse each piece in 3 successive baths of 500ml
water. Use fresh water for each piece. Then immerse in 250ml 1M sodium
bicarbonate. If it bubbles, rinse in water once more until no bubbling occurs.
Squeeze dry and spread on paper towels to dry overnight.


  D. Nitroglycerine

    Nitroglycerine is a *VERY* dangerous shock sensitive explosive. It is used
in making dynamite, among other things.

    I am not sure as to the proportions and amounts of chemicals to be used,
so
I shall use estimates.

Materials-
  70ml conc. sulfuric acid
  30ml conc. nitric acid
  10 ml glycerine
  ice bath
  150ml beaker

   Put the 150ml beaker in the ice bath and make sure that it is very cold.
Slowly add the 70ml sulfuric and 30ml nitric acids to the beaker, trying to
maintain a low temperature. When the temperature starts to level off, add
about
10 ml glycerine. If it turns brown or looks funny, **RUN LIKE HELL**. When
Nitrog lycerine turns brown, that means it's ready to explode... If it stays
clear and all works well, keep the temperature as low as you can and let it
sit
for a few hours. You then should have some Nitroglycerine, probably mixed with
nitric and sulfuric acids. When you set it off, you must not be nearby.
Nitroglycerine can fill 10,000 times its original area with expanding gases.
This means that hat if you have 10ml's of Nitroglycerine in there, it will
produce some 100,000 ml's of gases. To make it into dynamite, the
Nitroglycerine
must be absorbed into somethin g like wood pulp or diamaeceous earth (spelled
something like that).

IV. Other stuff

  A. Peroxyacetone

   Peroxyacetone is extremely flammable and has been reported to be shock
sensitive.

Materials-
  4ml Acetone
  4ml 30% Hydrogen Peroxide
  4 drops conc. hydrochloric acid
  150mm test tube

 Add 4ml acetone and 4ml hydrogen peroxide to the test tube. Then add 4 drops
concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to
appear. If no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40
celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours. Swirl the slurry and
filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours. To ignite,
light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while staying at least a
meter away).

  B. Smoke smoke smoke...

   The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke. Since this
reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary for
larger amounts of smoke.

   6g zinc powder
   1g sulfur powder

    Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back. A lot of smoke should be
created.

    There are many other experiments I could have included, but I will save
them
for the next Chemist's Corner article. Upcoming articles will include Glow-in-
the-dark reactions, 'party' reactions, things you can do with household
chemicals, and more...

    I would like to give credit to a book by Shakashari entitled "Chemical
Demonstrations" for a few of the precise amounts of chemicals in some
experiments.


   This is it for Chemist's Corner #1... look for Chemist's Corner #2: What to
do with household chemicals...

Article #2: Household chemicals
By Zaphod Beeblebrox/MPG

     This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting
experiment with common household chemicals. Some may or may not work depending
on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and brands. I
would
suggest that the person doing these experiments have some knowledge of
chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.

     I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this
information. It is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who
are
interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.

etc...


EXP #1: Ye old fizz experiment

     Mix vinegar with baking soda. It produces sodium acetate and carbonic
acid.
Carbonic acid quickly decomposes into carbon dioxide and water, resulting in
the
"fizz".

     This simple reaction can be contained in a small bottle or something, and
when enough pressure builds up it will break open. I sincerely doubt that it
will blow "all four walls off the house" as some loser wrote in his Safehouse
article. The same basic thing can be done with dry ice & water, baking powder
&
water, citric acid & baking soda, and many other combinations.

EXP #2: A fruity battery

 If you're ever in need of a little power, get your hands on these:

 a citrus fruit (lemon, orange, etc)
 a small zinc strip
 a small copper strip

  Just stick the zinc strip in one end of a lemon and a copper strip in the
other. You now have a 1.5 volt battery! Just attach the wires to the copper &
zinc strips...

EXP #3: Generating chlorine gas

     This is slightly more dangerous than the other two experiments, so you
should know what you're doing before you try this...

 Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say 'DO NOT mix with chlorine bleach',
and vice-versa? That's because if you mix ammonia water with Ajax or something
like it, it will give off chlorine gas. To capture it, get a large bottle and
put Ajax in the bottom. Then pour some ammonia down into the bottle. Since the
chlorine is heavier than air, it will stay down in there unless you use large
amounts of either Ajax or ammonia (DON'T!). For something fun to do with
chlorine stay tuned....

EXP #4: Chlorine + turpentine

     Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine. Quickly drop it into
the bottle of chlorine. It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably
start burning...


EXP #5: Generating hydrogen gas

     To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with that acid. Try vinegar (acetic acid) with zinc, aluminum, magnesium, etc.
You can collect hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter than
air... Light a small amount and it burns with a small *pop*. Another way of
creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water. This involves seperating
water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current. To do this, you
need a 6-12 volt battery, two test tubes, a large bowl, two carbon electrodes
(take them out of an unworking 6-12 volt battery), and table salt. Dissolve
the
salt in a large bowl full of water. Submerge the two test tubes in the water
and
put the electrodes inside them, with the mouth of the tube a iming down.
Connect
the battery to some wire going down to the electrodes. Thi s will work for a
while, but chlorine will be generated along with the oxygen which will
undoubtedly corrode your copper wires leading to the carbon electrodes... (the
table salt is broken up into chlorine and sodium ions, the chlorine comes off
as a gas with oxygen while sodium reacts with the water to form sodium
hydroxide....). Therefore, if you can get your hands on some sulfuric acid,
use
it instead. It will not affect the reaction other than making the water
conduct
electricity.


EXP #6: Hydrogen + chlorine

      Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with your thumb. Keep
it inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine (not one that has
reacted
with turpentine). Say "goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle. The
hydrogen and chlorine should react and possibly explode (depending on purity
and amount of each gas). An interesting thing about this is they will not
react
if it is dark and no heat or other energy is around. When a light is turned
on,
enough energy is present to cause them to react...

EXP #7: Preparation of oxygen

     Get some hydrogen peroxide (from a drug store) and manganese dioxide
(from
a battery- it's a black powder). Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off
oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered, pressure will build up and shoot it off.
Try
lighting a wood splint and sticking it (when only glowing) into the bottle.
The oxygen will make it burst into flame. Experiment with it. The oxygen will
allow things to burn better...

EXP #8: Alcohol

     Buy some rubbing alcohol in a drug store. Usually this is either 70% or
99%
alcohol and burns just great. You can soak a towel in water and then in
alcohol,
light the towel, and when it finishes burning the alcohol, the flame should g
o
out and leave the towel unharmed. Nice for "party tricks", etc.

EXP #9: Iodine?

     Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine. To
seperate
them, put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat it over a
candle. Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the tincture
(about
4-6 inches above it) with ice on top of it. The alcohol should evaporate, and
the iodine should sublime, but should reform iodine crystals on the cold metal
lid directly above. If this works (I haven't tried), you can use the iodine
along with household ammonia to form Nitrogen Triiodide (discussed in article
#1).

Effective Neck-breaking techniques:
----------------------------------

                  *Crossneck*

  This method will only work if you are much taller (1 1/2 - 2 feet) than your
target, or the target is sitting down (guards, teachers, etc.)

   Approach the target from the behind SLOWLY as not to startle, then place
your left arm around the neck, and the right arm across the neck (over the
left)
and grab your upper-left arm with your right arm.  Move the right arm upward
sharply, and the left arm left firmly around the neck.  Pop the neck out of
the
spinal cord, and seperate the head from the rest of the body. The neck should
be
quite twistable now.  Damage the spinal cord, so the victim has little/no hope
for survival.  Don't even think about whipping out a knife.  This method is
for
killing without leaving a single mark.

                   *Throat demolition*

  When using this technique, be sure to rid your concience of any regrets
while
attempting this.  You will be staring your victin eye-to-eye, and you dont
want
to cower out.  Your victim will have a scared-shitless look of "Why me?" They
will look so innocent, it might make you chicken out.  Check out "The Cypher's
guide to the elimination of the concience" if you have these problems.  It
could
mean the difference between life and death...

  Creep up to your mark while they are leaning over (reading, loading gun,
etc.)
 Stare down at what they're doing by their RIGHT side, then place the left arm
around the neck from the underside. In other words, extend the right arm under
their chin, then reach back around to the back of the head.  Grab the neck
tightly, plpace your shoulder on their chest, flip them over onto the table or
floor, then punch them AS HARD AS YOU CAN right in the throat.

I'm not sadistic (yeah, sure, you say,) and I am somewhat of an animal lover,
but a good way to practice this technique is with pigs.  Go down to any
forestry
project, and then find out where some of the pigs are...  This will not be too
hand to do.  Just look for severe underbrush.  Wait, and they will come. 
Ambush
from behind, and the pigs neck is yours.  Im not sure if this kind of hunting
is
legal (bare hands) but it is essential for proper exercises in the art of the
elimination of the concience.

EXPLOSIONS: Effective demolition.
---------------------------------

   We will be using this brand of Pipe Bomb in most all of our elimination
exploits:

One 1 foot length of pipe (threaded)
two caps for the ends of the pipe.
one baby-food jar
about a baby-food jar full worth of vinegar
baking soda
some gravel

To construct the pipe bomb:

1. Cap one end of the pipe with a metal cap TIGHTLY!
2. Fill the baby-food jar with vinegar, cover, AND WIPE CLEAN!
3. Drop the baby-food jar into the pipe lightly as not to break, and add
   some gravel.
4. Pour baking soda to the rim into the pipe bomb.
5. Cap the other end very tightly.

Synopsis:

Once you crack the pipe hard enough to break the baby food jar, it will cause
the baking soda to create such pressure, that it will explode.  The explosion
is
more than effective.  Rumor has it that when it was thrown into an old car, it
blew the doors about ten feet away, and the roof three feet into the air. When
this device was constructed by myself, I just stuck it under an old tree, and
it
was removed. You have about five minutes to wait, so you might still have time
to acquire a quick alibi.

USING THE PIPE/PRESSURE BOMB
----------------------------

  Someone you hate? Well, creep out of your house REAL LATE at night (3-4:00)
and walk up to their house. Crack it to start on the driveway, and throw under
the car.  Run home, then read the police reports. Once you have been better
acquainted with device, it can be used to help you out.  Throw it under the
stage of a play, or leave it in the bathroom of your school, etc.


MOLOTOV COCTAILS IMPROVED:
-------------------------

  Well, the origional Molotov coctail was used differently..  Its not REALLY
improved, but its better this way.  Molotov created this weapon in the Russian
revolution (give them a taste of their own medicine) and the formula was 50%
gasoline, alchohol, and 50% oil.  With the oil, it sticks to what it hits. 
Much
more effective...

MODIFYING MOST SEMI-AUTOMATICS
------------------------------

   Whats this B.S. about spending $3000 for a full-auto kit?  All we did was
file down the firing pin, and it worked almost perfectly.  File down the part
by
the springs that rubs against the tracks, so it is free.  This works best with
a
good-old M-16, or most HK rifles.

SURVIVALIST PYROTECHNICS
------------------------

  It is almost imperative for the modern-day snow camper to carry around a bit
of gasoline (i know, only the shitbaits do that, but the wind gets pretty
rough
out there) with you.  Once that much has been done, you are ready for the
Survivalist's bomb: in other files, the GENERIC BOMB.  This bomb is
infamous among bulletin boards, but because it suits this method better, I
call
it the survivalists bomb.

1 jar, pipe, etc. few drops of gasoline. a few drops of potassium permanganate
found in most all snakebite kits

I.   Put in a few drops of gas into the jar, pipe, etc... and coat the surface
inside.

II.  Once the gas has evaporated, put in a few drops of Pot. Permangate, and
     close the jar shut.

Throw the jar at your target, or the truck under you, or into the crowd at the
mardi-gras and be far away.  This bomb will pack 1/2 stick of standard GCM
dynamite.  Handy, indeed.

SIMPLE SMOKE BOMB FOR CAFETERIA USE
-----------------------------------

Get ten packets for sugar, and ten packets of salt.  Grab a straw, and have a
lighter nearby.  Pour all of this into an ash-tray, and heat the bottom with a
lighter, until it melts.  Stir occasionally.  Once it has been all melted,
stick
a bunch of matchheads (if possible) into the goop.  When done, stick a straw
into the goop nice and deep.  Stop heating, and leave it on a chair so it
solidifies.  Drop some matchheads into the straw.  When it is nice and solid,
light the straw and leave.  It will fill a moderately-sized cafeteria with
thick
white smoke.  If you want to improve, pour maldahyde (SP?) into the solution
for
instant tear-gas.

As for knives, etc.  Use your own judgement.   I will not go into all the
details on such a large subject. I deal in mostly improvisational tactics.

Enjoy.

by The Kid & Co. and The Shadow

  An inspection of you local Telco offi ce trash receptacles can reveal a
wealth
of documents of great interest to a tel ecommunications hobbiest.  The fone
company doesn't expect anyone except ma ybe bums to paw through their refuge,
and therefore often disposes some inter esting materials.  In all the
installation we have investigated, the  Company doesn't shred or incinerate
anything.  Most sites have their garbag e in trash bags convenient for removal
an leisurely inspection at home.

  A case in point.  The authors of this  article have been engaged in trashing
for about three months, finding quite i nformative info, but when we escorted
two phriends from the city on an expedi tion, we didn't know the most
efficient
methods.  They came out of the boondock s of New Jersey to inspect the wealth
of
AT&T and Bell installations in the region.  They were quite expert at
trashing,
having more experience in the art, so we merely watched an copied their
technique.

  Our first hit of the night was of an AT&T Information Systems office
building.  We gathered a large mass of manuals and binders.  Then we moved
onward to hit AT&T Communcations, the local business office, our central
office, and another Bell site.  After a successful session, we decided to call
it a night.

  We sorted the piles of garbage for things of merit.  Our phriends gathered
the majority of the really interesting items, but we salvaged several things
of worth.  This sorting session was conducted in the center of town, to the
amusement of passers-by.  It was interesting to explain to friends that passed
by what we were doing.  We BS'ed an inquisitive young lady into thinking that
we were a local group of Boy Scouts cleaning the area as a project for our
Eagle Scout badge.  Following the tendency of the masses to follow falsehoods,
she complimented us on how clean the town looked, for she had been out of the
country for the last couple of months.  A couple of times we alsmost
contradicted each other as everyone got into the flow of falsehoods.

  Numerous things of interest can be found in Bell trash.  Ones that are of
use
to anyone are binders and notebooks with the Bell logo on them, good for
impressing friends.  Also, supplies of Bell letterhead are good for scaring
phriends.  Documents of more interest to phreaks can also be found.  Cosmos
printouts abound in any CO trash.  In house telephone directories list
employees of Bell, goot to try social engineering on.  Manuals also have merit
for the phreak.  Maintenance reports, trunk outages reports, line reports,
network control analysis (NCA), TSPS documents, and lists of abbreviations
used
by the fone company can be found.  The latter is of great importance as it
allows one to decipher the cryptic documents.  Bell seems to love ridiculous
and mysterious abbreviations and anacronyms.

                            "Looking for Notebooks"

  The expert trasher must be willing to physically enter the dumpster.  Only
reaching in for easily obtainable objects misses heavy manuals that tend to
sink to the bottom.  Huge bulky printouts, directories, and obese manuals as
well as binders settle out of reach.  Also, once in the dumpster, inquisitive
security can't see you.                

  Speaking of security, what are the dangers of trashing?  Well, we don't
know,
having never been caught at it.  The basic fact which protects the trasher is
the ludicrousness of someone stealing your garbage.  Probably the most they
can
get you for is trespassing, and most of the time they'll probably just throw
you off of the property.  Good excuses for being around the dumpster are that
you are passing through on a shortcut, that a ball or frisbee has flown in, or
you are looking for notebooks for school.

  A good way to avoid unnecessary surveillance by Telco employees is to trash
late at night, after most have gone home.  Weekends, especially Sunday nights,
leave the sites deserted, except for security or janitorial staff.  Before
starting on a trashing run, be sure to reconnoiter the area, and find out the
schedule of garbage collection.  That way you can hit the trash at the fullest
and most profitable time.

  One thing that simplifies trashing runs is the use of a car.  A car will
allow one to hit trash sites farther afield, as well as assisting in the
removal of bags and boxes of trash to sort at your leisure.  Trash sorting
really shouldn't be done on site as it increases the possible time for your
discovery by security.  Removing garbage by foot invites stares and limits the
amount that can be removed.  The car should drop off the trashers and return
about a half hour later, depending on the amount of trash there.  Before
dropping them off, be sure to investigate if there is any trash in the first
place for, as past experience has shown, they tend to get quite angered when
they have spent the last hour staring at an empty trash container.

  The on-site trashers should be willng to hop into the dumpster.  As we
mentioned, this maximizes the amount of trash that can be reached.  They
should
rip open any bags, shoving the uninteresting ones to the rear and botton of
the
container, while bringing new ones to the forefront.  Boxes in the trash
should
be used to carry the documents into the trunk of the car for leisurely
sorting.
This should be done with a minimum of noise and light, if flashlights are to
be
used.  The trasher shouldn't attempt to take the best stuff, just to grab as
much as looks interesting.

  At the appointed time, the car should return and pick up the trashers. 
Boxes
should be stuffed in the trunk as quickly as possible.  Smell won't be much of
a problem, as all you are taking are papers.  Occasionally a bag of coffee
grinds smells up the works, but you, at all costs, should avoid cafeteria
dumpsters as the rotting food really reeks, and contains little of value to
the
telecommunications hobbiest.

  The car should then drive off to a safe and secluded spot to sort the trash.
The location should be well lit and have another dumpster handy to throw the
real trash out permanently.  The valuable stuff should be take home and sorted
according to type.  By keeping all of the similar stuff together, patterns can
be recognized. Here, abbreviation lists come in handy.  The date and location
where the trash is located helps to keep the junk organized.

  A carful inspection of local Telco trash receptables can be informative and
fun.  Any real phreak should find out at the least what the switching
equipment
for his/her/its area is.  Proper trashing technique is gained by experience,
so
climb on in!  Well, happy trashing and have a phree day.

       : ELECTRONIC TERRORISM :

    It starts when a big, dumb lummox rudely insults you.  Being of a
rational, intelligent disposition, you wisely choose to avoid a (direct)
confrontation.  But as he laughs in your face, you smile inwardly---your
revenge is already planned.

Step 1:  Follow your victim to his locker, car, or house.  Once you have
  chosen your target site, lay low for a week or more, letting your anger
  boil.

Step 2:  In the mean time, assemble your versatile terrorist kit (details
  below.)

Step 3:  Plant your kit at the designated target site on a Monday morning
  between the hours of 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM.  Include a calm, suggestive
  note that quietly hints at the possibility of another attack.  DO NOT
  WRITE IT BY HAND!  An example of an effective note:
    "Don't be such a jerk, or the
     next one will take off your
     hand.  Have a nice day."
  Notice how the calm tone instills fear, as if written by a homicidal  
psycho.
 
Step 5:  Choose a strategic location overlooking the target site.  Try
  to position yourself in such a way that you can see his facial contortions.

Step 6:  Sit back and enjoy the fireworks!


Assembly of the versatile, economic, and effective Terrorist Kit #1:
The parts you'll need are:
 1) 4 AA Batteries
 2) 1 9-Volt Battery
 3) 1 SPDT Mini Relay (Radio Shack)
 4) 1 Rocket Engine(Smoke Bomb or M-80)
 5) 1 Solar Ignitor (any hobby store)
 6) 1 9-Volt Battery connector

Step 1:  Take the 9-volt battery and wire it through the relay's coil.
  This circuit should also include a pair of contacts that when separated
  cut off this circuit.  These contacts should be held together by trapping
  them between the locker,mailbox, or car door.  Once the door is opened,
  the contacts fall apart and the 9-volt circuit is broken, allow-
  ing the relay to fall to the close  postion thus closing the ignition
  circuit. (If all this is confusing take a look at the schematic below.)

Step 2: Take the 4 AA batteries and wire them in succession.  Wire the
  positive terminal of one to the negative terminal of another, until
  all four are connected except one positive terminal and one negative
  terminal.  Even though the four AA batteries only combine to create
  6 volts, the increase in amperage is necessary to activate the solar
  ignitor quickly and effectively.

Step 3:  Take the battery pack (made in step 2) and wire one end of it
  to the relay's single pole and the other end to one prong of the solar
  ignitor.  Then wire the other prong of the solar ignitor back to the
  open position on the relay.

Step 4:  Using double sided carpet tape mount the kit in his locker, mailbox,
  or car door.  And last, insert the solar ignitor into the rocket engine
  (smoke bomb or M-80).

     Your kit is now complete!

    HOW TO MAKE A FLASHLIGHT BOMB

A FLASHLIGHT BOMB IS FAIRLY EASY IT
MAKE AND CAN BE CONCEALED SO WELL, THAY
IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT
IT. HERES WHAT TO DO:
 
GET YOURSELF ONE FLASHLIGHT OF ANY
SIZE, SHAPE, OR CREED, AND THE 
BATTERY/BATTERIES THAT GO ALONG WITH
IT.  NOW IT IS TIME FOR AN IMPORTANT
DECISION.  DEPENDING UPON THE TYPE
OF BOMB YOU REQUIRE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A CHOICE IN MATERIALS.  HERE ARE YOUR
CHOICES:
 
[1] MERCURIC CHLORIDE - GAS BOMN
[2] PURE SODIUM+WATER - FLAME BOMB
[3] SULFURIC NITRATE  - ACID BOMB
[4] GUNPOWDER (TNT)   - BOOOOOOOOM!
 
NOW, TAKING THE MATERIAL FOR THE TYPE 
OF BOMB YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE, 
PROCEED TO PUT ROCKS, BB'S, GLASS
PELLETS, ETC... IN THE BOTTOM OF A
HOLLOWED OUT BATTERY/BATTERIES, UNLESS
YOU ARE MAKING A FLAME BOMB, WHICH IN
THAT CASE READ ON.  THEN LINE A 
MAGNESIUM STRIP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE
FLASHLIGHT APPRERING ON TOP OF THE
FLASHLIGHT SO YOU MAY LIGHT IT.  NEXT,
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF THE
EXPLOSIVE YOU CHOSE IN THE BATTERY. 
[ NOT YOU MAY LIGHTLY PACK IT IN, BUT
DO NOT HIT IT!!! MY FRIEND WAS PACKING
A HOME-MADE BOMB ONE DAY, AND HAMMERED
THE COVER ON, AND BLEW A HOLE RIGHT 
THROUGH HIS LIQUOR CABINET ] NEXT,
SECURE THE TOP, LEAVING ROOM TO INSERT
THE MAGNESIUM STRIP.  IT SHOULD LOOK
LIKE THIS:

     -----------
     \         /
      \       /
       \_____/
       ! BMB !
       ! BMB !
       ! BMB !
       ! BBB !
       !     !
       !_____!

IN THE LAST DIAGRAM, (B) STANDS FOR 
BATTERY AND (M) FOR MAGNESIUM.  ALSO
INSIDE THE BATTERY SHOULD BE THE AMMO
AND THE EXPLOSIVE.  
 
NOW FOR THE FLAME BOMB...THE SODIUM,
SHOULD BE ON THE TOP, AND THE WATER
IN A BABYFOOD JAR.  THE SODIUM USED
HERE IS NOT TABLE SALT!!!  YOU WON'T
NEED THE MAG. STRIP BEAUSE NUMBER 1,
BECUASE ALL YOU NEED DO IS HIT THE
FLASHLIGHT AGAINST SOMETHING HARD.
DO NOT HOLD IT---THROW IT AS FAR AS
YOU CAN!!!


           remember DONT GET CAUGHT!

                              EXPLOSIVE PENS



     Here are the instructions for building a device no agent should be

without.  From the mind of "Q" himself, a device for your evaluation.



Materials......



           [1]-(1) "Felt" Tip Pen

           [2]-(1) "Ball" Point Pen

           [3]-(1)  High quality firecracker!

           [4]-(1)  8 gram measure potassium parmagranite (optional)

           [5]-(x)  Scotch Tape

           [6]-(1)  Large Paper Clip

           [7]-(2)  Packages of matches

           [8]-(1)  Pair of scissors

           [9]-(1)  Length of Beige thread



Assembly......



[1]- Use thread to friction saw the felt tip pen in half at the point

     where the cap "snaps" onto the pen. (about mid-section)
[2]- Remove the innerts of the felt tip pen, and throw them away.

[3]- Pull the innerts out of a bic ball point pen and remove the ball

     point assembly at the front of the pen.

[4]- Use scissors to widen the hole in the "felt" end of the pen.  Insert

     the ball assembly and make sure it is a tight fit.  It should now

     look as if the felt tip pen was constructed as a ball point pen.

[5]- Cut off abrasive strips from the packs of matches.  It is best if they

     have not been used. Tape these to the top of the firecracker near
     the fuse, the strips should run parallel to the outstreched fuse.

     Wrap fuse over the top of one strip and tape down so fuse runs parallel

     to abrasive strips.

[6]- Unbend paperclip and tape a match to the metal rod, the match should

     be parallel to the rod and it should be taped tight using as little

     tape as possible.

[7]- Insert the match head 1/5 of the way between the abrasive strips

     and wrap tape around the assembly.  It should now look like this.



                         ------______-----

            [][][]a[][][]-----------------(b)

                                 (())---------------------

                         ______------_____               |(c)

                                          |(d)

     (a)-Explosive/(b)-Fuse/(c)-Match attached to metal rod/(d)-Abrasives

     The entire assembly should be thin enough to slip into the case of

     the felt tip pen.

[8]- Using scissors drill a small hole in the "non-tip" end of the felt

     tip pen case.  Insert the assembly so the metal rod fits through the

     hole in the end of the pen case.

[9]- The assembly will not quite fit properly.  The firecracker will

     protrude from the cut half of the felt tip case.  Slip the removed

     end of the case over the firecracker. (join the halfs together over

     the firecracker in the center) and mount the cap of the felt tip pen

     on the end of the metal rod.  Glue any loose parts.  You are done!



To Detonate...



     Simply hit the cap (mounted at end of pen permanently) and throw

it at your target, or hand it to your target.  My favourite is to say

"Think Fast" and throw them your felt tip pen. (make it a easy throw)

Your victim will catch it, and it will then explode.  Cutting off many

small appendages if you coat the firecracker with potassium parmagranite.

Or killing your target if you use contact poison in place of the potassium.



Theory of operation...



     Quite simple, by hitting the cap you are ramming the match head at

the end of the metal rod between the tight abrasive strips causing

combustion. Or the "Orgasm" effect. (the term Axis Agents use!) The

fire lights the fuse and from there, the pen is history! (pardon the pun)

After hitting the cap you have a average time limit of 2.5 seconds to

rid yourself of the pen. (plenty of time actually...)

   So, you want to learn about some explosives, eh sonny? Well,
you have come to the right place. Starting with this file, a
series begins that will try to bring that world of demolitions
and fun ( ha ha ) a little closer to you. This serier,
ingeniously dubbed the "Explosive Files" will go through the
many types of explosives around. In addition, a few sidetracks
will be made on the way in the areas of fireworks or whatever
seems appropriate. As you delve through what is contained in the
files, you may find some helpful information, you may not. But
have fun reading them anyway.

   If you haven't figured this one out yet, this file is
formatted for 80 columns. And the rest of the files are the same
way. So, using a quote I saw once on a file on a board,

                           EXPLOSIVES
                ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


   To start learning about explosives, you have got to start at
the begining. I plan to be as thorough as possible, but I may
forget things every now and then. The files should still be
complete though. So now to start at the begining......

   An explosive is a substance that, under the influence of heat,
shock, or some other agency, undergoes a chemical reaction that
causes it to decompose or break up quickly with more or less
violence ( whew ). Explosives fly to pieces because the materials
composing them react in such a way that solids or liquids are
suddenly converted into gases, which tend to expand and rapidly
fill a larger volume of space. Heat is also developed and acts as
a catalyst ( something that changes the speed of the reaction in
some way. In this case it speeds it up. ). The noise associated
with an explosion is caused by air waves. An explosion is an
intensified combustion also.
   The history of explosives is too long for one file, but
certain events are covered in individual files. For instance,
gunpowder's history is in the gunpowder file.
   Lets narrow the scope a little here and get a little
introduction into explosives. How they are classified is a good
thing to know, so here it is.

   There are basically 3 differnt types of explosives existing.
All explosives fall into one of these categories somewhere. What
follows is a listing of each of these categories with a brief
description and some examples.


I. Propellants

   Propellants, or low explosives, are combustible materials,
containing within themselves all oxygen needed for their
combustion. They burn themselves out but do not explode, and
function by producing gas which explodes.

Examples are Black powder and smokeless powder.


II. Primary Explosives

   Primary Explosives, or initiators as they are sometimes
called , explode or detonate when they are heated or subjected
to shock. They do not burn and sometimes they do not even
contain the elements necessary for combustion. The materials
themselves explode, and the explosion results whether they are
confined or not. Their brisance, or the shock which they produce
when they explode, differs considerably in different explosives,
as does their sensitivity to heat and the amount of heat they
give off.

Examples : Mercury Fulminate, Lead Azide, Fulminating Gold,
the mixture of Red Phosphorus with Potassium Chlorate, Copper
Acetylide, Nitrogen Sulfide, and Tetracene.


III. High Explosives

   High Explosives detonate under the influence of the shock
of the explosion of a suitable primary explosive. They do not
function by burning. Most of them can be ignited by a flame
though and in a small amount generally burn tranquilly and can
be extinguished easily. If heated to a high temperature by
external heat or by their own combustion, they will sometimes
explode. They are generally more brisant and powerful than
primary explosives. They exert a mechanical effect on whatever
is near them when they explode, whether they are confined or
not.

Examples : Dynamite, Trinitrotoluene, Tetryl, Picric Acid,
Nitrocellulose, Nitroglycerin, Liqiud Oxygen mixed with wood
pulp, fuming Nitric Acid mixed with Nitrobenzene, Ammonium
Nitrate , Ammonium Perchlorate, and Nitroguanidine.


   So Now you have taken the first step toward your explosive
education. The next file will be on igniters and will be
important for detonating stuff. See ya then.

    A small but major part of any explosive is how to ignite it.
Some materials, like gunpowder, will ignite quickly when in
contact with flame. But some explosives will not light by just
a flame and hence they require some thing with some more power,
maybe even another explosive. What follows is a list of your
basic igniters.


BLACK MATCH

          Black match is made with fine, soft cotton twine and
meal powder. It is easily made by twisting 3 or 4 strands of the
twine together and covering the resulting cord with a paste made
by mixing the meal powder with water. The excess paste should be
wiped off and the cord should be allowed to dry while stretched
across a frame. A slower match can be made by twisting the twine
and using a homemade black powder as the paste. This powder is
made by mixing 6 parts Potassium nitrate, 1 part sulfur, and 1
part soft wood charcoal. This match and slight derivations are
used on nearly ever firework available. Its cheap, reliable if
made right, and easy.


QUICK MATCH

          Quick match is black match inserted into a paper tube
which does not need to fit tightly. When light, the black match
burns through the tube at a extremely quick rate.


MINERS FUSE

     Miners Fuse is also called Safety Fuse or Bickford Fuse. It
consists of a central thread surrounded by a core of black powder
enclosed within a tube of woven threads, which is then surrounded
by waterproof materials, etc. It commonly burns at the rate of 1
foot a minute. When the fire reaches the end, a jet of flame
about 1 inch long shoots out for the purpose of igniting black
powder or lighting a blasting cap.


DETONATING FUSE

     Detonating Fuse, or Cordeau, is a narrow tube filled with
high explosive. When the explosion is initiated at one end by a
detonator, the explosion travels along the tube with a high
velocity which causes other high explosives in its path to
explode. In America, cordeau is made from lead tubes filled with
TNT, from aluminum or tin tubes filled with Picric Acid, and from
tubes of woven fabric filled with Nitrocellulose or PETN ( yes,
thats Pentaerythrite Tetranitrate ).


BLASTING CAPS

     Instead of making a whole seperate file out of blasting
caps, my first intention, I will just put the stuff here.

     Blasting caps were invented in 1867 by Alfred Nobel, who
also first made Nitroglycerin, invented dynamite and blasting
gelatin, and provided funding to start the Nobel prizes. What a
cool dude. There exist 3 different kinds of blasting caps,
varying from a simple fuse wrapped by explosive to a complicated
waterproff cap involving an electrical detonation. . There is
also 8 grades, or strengths of caps, denoted by numbers (  No. 1,
No. 6, etc. ). Usually the strength is marked on the cap.

     SIDENOTE : Electrically ignited caps are the most common
type available. If you live anywhere near a quarry, try to get a
tour of the place. Watch wherever you walk. blasting caps abound
in areas like this. When nobodys looking, pocket a few.

     What follows is a generally useless chart, but here it is
anyway. It shows a little about the strengths of each cap type
( see another file about mercury fulminate ).

the best ones out of the whole group.

     Here we are with a list of primary high explosives. It's not
much, but there are not many of them. There are many more
secondary high and low explosives ( see the next two files ).

Mercury Fulminate
:::::::::::::::::

     Mercury Fulminate is an initiating explosive, commonly
appearing as white or gray crystals. It is extremely sensetive to
initiation by heat, friction, spark or flame, and impact. It will
detonate when initiated by any of the ways. When stored
continiously at temperatures above 100 degrees F it gradually
becomes inert. A dark-colored product of deterioration gives
evidence of this condition. Mercury Fulminate is commonly stored
underwater except in places where freezing is possible. Then it
is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.


Lead Styphnate
:::: :::::::::

     Lead Styphnate is an initiating explosive, usually appearing
in orange or white crystals. It is easily ignited by heat and
static discharge, but cannot be used to start secondary high
explosive reliably. Lead Styphnate is an ingredient in priming
mixtures for small arms ammunition. Lead Styphnate is stored
underwater except where freezing is possible. Then it stored
under water and alcohol.


Lead Azide
:::: :::::

     Lead Azide is an initiating explosive produced as a white to
buff crystalline substance. It is more reliable than Mercury
Fulminate and it does not decompose during long storage at
moderately elevated temperatures ( 90 and above ). It should not
be loaded into copper or brass containers because Copper Azide,
an extremely sensitive explosive, can be formed in the presence
of moisture.


DDNP
Diazodinitrophenol
::::::::::::::::::

     DDNP is a primary high explosive. It is used extensively in
commercial blasting caps that are initiated by black powder
safety fuse. It is superior to Mercury Fulminate in stability
but is not as stable as Lead Azide. DDNP is desenzitized by
immersion in water.

   This section is a rather complete listing of secondary high
explosives. They are listed in no particular order and thay all
have a bit of information about them again, just like the
primary high explosives. I think that this is probably the best
file in the whole group so have fun.


TNT
TRINITROLOLUENE
:::::::::::::::

     TNT is produced from Toluene, Sulfuric acid, and Nitric
acid. It is powerful high explosive. It is well suited for steel
cutting, concrete breaching, general demonlition, and underwater
demolition. It is a stable explosive and relatively insensitive
to shock. It may be detonated by a blasting cap or primacord.
TNT is toxic and its dust should not be inhaled or allowed
contact with the skin.


NITROSTARCH
:::::::::::

     Nitrostarch is composed of Starch Nitrate, Barium Nitrate,
and Sodium Nitrate. It is more sensitive to flame, friction, and
shock than TNT but not as powerful. It is initiated by
detonating cord.


TETRYL
::::::

     Tetryl is a fine, yellow crystalline material and exhibits
a very high shattering power. It is commonly used as a booster
in explosive trains. It is stable in storage. It is used in
detonators.


RDX
CYCLONITE
:::::::::

     RDX is a white crystalline solid that exhibits very high
shattering power. It is commonly used as a booster in explosive
trains or as a main bursting charge. It is stable in storage.


NITROGLYCERIN
:::::::::::::

     Nitroglycerin is manfactured by treating Glycerin with a
nitrating mixture of Nitric Acid and Sulfuric acid. It is thick,
clear to yellow-brownish, and extremely powerful and shock
sensetive. Nitroglycerin freezes at 56 degrees farenheit in
which state it is less sensitive to shock than in liquid form.


COMMERCIAL DYNAMITE
:::::::::::::::::::

     Commercial dynamite comes in three principal types.
Straight dynamite, Ammonia dynamite, and Gelatin dynamite. Each
type is further divided into a series of grades. All dynamites
contain Nitroglycerin in varying amounts and the strength of the
explosion is related to the Nitroglycerin content. Dynamite
ranges in detonation velocity from 4000 to 23,000 feet per
second and is sensitive to shock. Dynamite is initiated by
electric or nonelectric blasting caps.


PETN
PENTAERYTHRITE TETRANITRATE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     PETN is one of the most powerful of military explosives and
is almost equal in force to nitroglycrerine and RDX. When used
in detonating cord, it has a detonation velocity of 21,000
f.p.s. and is relatively insensitive to friction and shock from
handling and transportation.


MILITARY DYNAMITE
:::::::::::::::::

     Military ( construction ) dynamite, unlike other commercial
dynamite, does not absorb or retain moisture, contains no
nitroglycerine, and is much safer to store, handle, and
transport. It detonates at a velocity of about 20,000 feet per
second and is good for military construction, quarrying, or
demolition. It may be detonated with an electric or nonelectric
military blasting cap or detonating cord.


AMATOL
::::::

     Amatol is a high explosive, white to buff in color. It is a
mixture of Ammonium nitrate and TNT, with a relative
effectiveness slightly higher than TNT alone. Amatol is used a
main bursting charge in artillery shells and bombs. Amatol
absorbs moisture and can form dangerous compounds with copper
and brass.


BLASTING GELATIN
::::::::::::::::

     Blasting gelatin is a translucent material of an elastic,
jellylike texture and is made in a number of different colors.
It is considered to be the most powerful industrial explosive.
It is more water resistant than Gelatin dynamite.


COMPOSITION C4
::::::::::::::

     Composition C4 is a white plastic explosive more powerful
than TNT. It consists of 91% RDX and 9% plastic binder. It
remains plastic over a wide range of temperatures (-70 F. to 170
F. ), and is as sensitive as TNT. It is eroded less than other
plastic explosives when immersed is water for long periods. It
is well suited for cutting steel and timber and breaching
concrete.


COMPOSITION B
:::::::::::::

     Composition B is a high explosive mixture with a relative
efffectiveness higher than that of of TNT. It is also more
sensetive that TNT. It is composed of 59% RDX, 40% TNT, and 1%
wax. Because of its shattering power and high rate of
detonation, Composition B is used as the main charge in certain
bangalore torpedoes and shaped charges.


AMMONIUM NITRATE
::::::::::::::::

     Ammonium Nitrate is a white crystalline substance that is
extremely water absorbent and is therefor usually packed in a
sealed metal container. It has a low velocity of detonation (
3600 f.p.s ) and is used primarily as an additive to other
explosives. It is only 55% as powerful as TNT.


HMX
:::

     HMX is a solid high explosive commonly used as a booster
and sometimes as a main charge where its shattering effect is
needed. It is a white substance with a rather high melting
point; hence it is usually pressed into its container. It may be
initiated by Lead azide or Mercury fulminate.


PENTOLITE
:::::::::

     Pentolite is a high explosive made from equal mixtures of
PETN and TNT. It is light yellow and is used as the main
bursting charge in grenades, small shells, and shaped charges.
Pentolite should not be drilled to produce cavities; forming
tools should be used.


PICRIC ACID
:::::::::::

     Picric Acid is a yellow crystalline, high explosive
bursting charge. it is initiated by Lead azide or Mercury
fulminate and has the same effectiveness as TNT. When in contact
with lead, Picric acid produces Lead Picrate, a sensitive and
violent explosive.


GUN COTTON
::::::::::

     Gun cotton is a nitrocellulose explosive made from cotton
fibers containing 13% or more of nitrogen. Although primarily
considered a propellant, it is sometimes used as a base charge
in electric detonators.


AMMONAL
:::::::

     Ammonal is a high explosive mixture composed of 22%
Ammonium nitrate, 67% TNT, and 11% flaked or powdered aluminum.
It is sometimes used as a filler for artillery shell. The
composition is 83% as effective as TNT and explodes with a
bright flash upon detonation.


IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     Plastic explosive filler can be made from Potassium
Chlorate and petroleum jelly. The Potassium chlorate crystals
are ground into a very fine powder and then mixed with the
petroleum jelly. This explosive can be detonated with a No. 8
commercial blasting cap or with any military blasting cap. The
explosive must be stored in a waterproof container until ready
to use.


TETRYTOL
::::::::

     Tetrytol is a high explosive bursting charge containing 75%
Tetryl and 25% TNT. It is used as a demolitions explosive, a
bursting charge for mines, and in artillery shells. It is about
as strong as TNT.

     Probably the most common explosive you will ever encounter
in your travels is gunpowder. It is nearly everwhere. Most every
firework will use gunpowder. It is the easiest to make, and the
cheapest of all the explosive. How about a little bit of history
here...

     Gunpowder is the oldest of all the known explosives. It's
invention is credited to the Chinese, the Arabs, and the Hindus,
but the first one to publish anything definite on it was friar
Roger Bacon of Oxford in 1242. He wrote a book telling how to
make an explosive mixture containing saltpeter. For this reason
Roger Bacon is sometimes considered the inventor of gunpowder.
     Berthold Schwartz, a monk, also played his part in
gunpowders history by helping to develop firearms using
gunpowders properties. By 1326 cannons were being used.
     Certainly gunpowder helped change the course of the world.
It has been used in things such as warfare to mechanical
assistance.
     By the way, Saltpeter is Potassium Nitrate ( KNO3 ). Also,
doesn't it seem a bit funny that most of the people involved in
the history of explosives were religious people?
     The modern gunpowder is commonly called Black Powder, but
is made in about the same way as its ancestors. Saltpeter,
charcoal, and sulphur are mechanically mixed into a fix powder.
The rate of ingition depends on the grain size ; the smaller the
grains, the faster it burns. The exact proportions of each
material can vary, and each mixture is a little different. But
the most effective powder has been found to be in the ratio of 6
parts Saltpeter, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part sulphur. Here are a
few other mixtures though for your enjoyment.

     Brown powder, also called cocoa powder, was discovered and
it was found that it could be used as a replacement for normal
black charcoal. Brown powder is slower burning than its brother
and was used extensively in guns before smokeless powder was
developed. Cocoa powder is more sensitive to friction than
ordinary black powder. Samples have ingited when shaking in
canvas bags. As before, here are some exciting different
formulas.


           Saltpeter      Brown Charcoal      Sulphur

               80               20              0


     There are a few more variations of gunpowder existing too,
so check out the next file for a listing.

     A common myth about gunpowder is that it explodes. This is
wrong ( I know a few people out there are saying I'm full of
shit, right ? Well, it's the truth ). To really understand waht
happens it is necessary to know a little about chemistry. I'll
try to explain it to the average person now.
     The formula for saltpeter is KNO3 ( Potassium nitrate ). If
you don't know yet, the O stands for an oxygen atom, and there
are 3 of them. The 3 is supposed to be sub-scripted by the way,
so just imagine that it is. This means that in the gunpowder
mixture, there is a whole bunch of oxygen atoms. Well, pure
oxygen burns. But how does it break out of the KNO3 ? The oxygen
is attracted to the sulphur and charcoal, but is bonded to the
nitrogen ( N ) and can't get away normally. When it is lit, the
ignition breaks the N-O bonds and in an instantaneous moment
solid and gaseous products are formed. What ends up happening is
that the gases cause the explosion. Its is really more
complicated than that, but I would take a good 50 sectors going
into detail. For a better understanding of this, pick up an
encyclopedia or ask your chemistry teacher.

    They couldn't let black powder get all lonesome by being the
only worthwile powder useful in explosives, so somebody invented
a few more. Some of these are better than black powder, some
worse, some more expensive, some more convenient. But they are
all powders.

BLASTING POWDER

     Since normal black powder burns rather quickly when mixed
well, a slower and cheaper powder is needed for blasting. A
powder of this type can be obtained by reducing the amount of
Potassium Nitrate. The French government has manufactured and
sold the following kinds of blasting powder.

              SALTPETER         CHARCOAL         SULFUR
              :::::::::         ::::::::         ::::::

                 72                15              13
                 40                30              30
                 62                18              20


     In the United States, most blasting powder is made from
Sodium nitrate. Some samples taken show the following ratios.

          SODIUM NITRATE        CHARCOAL        SULFUR
          ::::::::::::::        ::::::::        ::::::

                68                 10             22
                73                 11             16

     Pellet powders, made from Sodium Nitrate, are becoming
popular. They are cylindrical pellets, 2 inches long, wrapped in
paraffined paper cartridges, and are from 1 and 1/4 to 2 inches
in diameter. The pellets resemble cartridges of dynamite. From 2
to 4 pellets whice are perforated in the direction of their axis
are wrapped in the cartridges and a 3/8 hole is bored for
insertion of fuse for firing. The pellets are also sold in most
hardware stores for use in welding torches under names like Solid
OX pellets and generally cost about $ 8.00 for a can of 7 or 8
sticks. You can buy these pellets and grind them up for a good
source of Sodium Nitrate powder. It makes a hell of a black
powder.


II. AMMONPULVER

     Propellant powder made from Ammonium nitrate is about as
powerful as smokeless powder and has long had a limited use for
military uses, especially in Germany and Austria.
     In 1855, a powder was patented called Amidpulver. Later the
formula was improved, giving the powder a flashless discharge
whan fired in a gun and only a moderate amount of smoke.
Ammonpulver which contains no Potassium nitrate explodes with no
flash and little smoke.

                        AMMONIUM       POTASSIUM
                        NITRATE         NITRATE        CHARCOAL
                       ::::::::::     :::::::::::     ::::::::::

Amidpulver                 38             44              16
improved Amidpulver        37             14              49
other formula              85              -              15

   Ammonpulver has the advantages of being cheap, powerful,
flashless, and almost smokeless. It is insensitive to shock and
friction, and is more difficult to ignite than black powder. In
use it requires a strong igniter charge.




III. POUDER BRUGERE

   Pouder Brugere is made by grinding together the following
composition :

                 Ammonium nitrate           54 parts
                 Potassium nitrate          46 parts

The powder is pressed and granulated as in the making of black
powder. It is more powerful than black powder and gives less
smoke.



FRENCH AMMONAL

   French Ammonal is an easily improvised low explosive mixture
of 86% Ammonium nitrate, 6% Stearic acid, and 8% Aluminum powder.
It is generly less effective than and equal weight of TNT.
Initiation by a Engineer's special blasting cap is recommended.

BUILDING A FLAME THROWER FROM THE BOOK:
THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND BY KURT SAXON
 
AN EXCELLENT LITTLE FLAME THROWER
CAN BE MADE, USING JUST ABOUT ANY METAL
OR PLASTIC HAND SQUIRTER. THE ONLY
CONSIDERATION IS THAT THE LIQUID MUST
COME OUT IN A STREAM INSTEAD OF AN
ATOMIZED SPRAY.

SOME OIL CANS SHOOT A STREAM 30
FEETS. SPRAYERS CAN OFTEN BE ADJUSTED
FROM A SPRAY TO A STREAM. SPRAYERS OF
VARIOUS KINDS CAN BE FOUND IN AUTO
SUPPLY, GARDEN AND GROCERY STORES.
 
A SIX-INCH TUBE, USUALLY ALUMINUM
OR BRASS, IS FITTEN ON THE NOZZLE. A
WICK OR PIECE OF HEAVY CLOTH IS WIRED
ONTO THE OTHER END OF THE TUBE. THE
FUEL IS GASOLINE, ACETONE OR LIGHTER
FLUID.
 
TO USE, THE TUBE IS TILTED DOWNWARD
SLIGHTLY. THE SPRAYER IS SQUEEZED
SLOWLY SO THE FUEL WILL DRIBBLE OUT
AND SATURATE THE WICK ALL AROUND.
 
THE WICK IS THEN LIT AND THE DEVICE
IS AIMED AND SQUEEZED. QUICK, HARD
SQUEEZES WILL SQUIRT THE FUEL THROUGH
THE TUBE AND PAST THE BURNING WICK.
THE WICK IGNITES THE FUEL AND YOU HAVE
SUCH A DANDY WEAPON YOU WILL NEVER STOP
BRAGGING! IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER,
HE CAN TAKE IT TO SCHOOL FOR SHOW AND
TELL.

                             INTRODUCTION

     SO YOU WANT TO BE A TERRORIST? YOU LIKE MAKING HOME-MADE CHEMICAL
CARBOMBS,
AND MAKING PEOPLE SUFFER, THAT'S NEAT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU FOR SURE THAT NO
SELF-RESPECTING TERRORIST WOULD GO OUT INTO THE CRUEL WORLD ALL BY HIS
LONESOME
WITHOUT A PIECE OF PROTECTION. I AM OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT SUBMACHINE-GUNS
AND
ASSAULT RIFLES. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE THAT FULL-AUTO
PROTECTION. WELL, I WILL TRY TO BEGIN TO INFORM YOU ON THE WAYS OF GETTING A
FULL-AUTO FIREARM. THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO: LEGAL & ILLEGAL.

                                LEGAL

     THERE ARE A FEW WAYS OF GOING ABOUT IT LEGALLY. IN ALL CASES
YOU NEED APROVAL FROM THE BATF (BUREAU OF ALCHOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS).
APPROVAL INVOLVES SENDING A LETTER TO THE BATF TELLING THEM WHERE YOU LIVE,
AND
WHY YOU WANT TO OWN A FULL-AUTO FIREARM. WHEN YOU WRITE THIS PORTION OF THE
LETTER, IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA NOT TO TELL THEM YOU WANT TO BLOW DUDES AWAY
WITH IT BECAUSE YOU MOST PROBABLY WOULD NOT GET APPROVAL. ONCE YOU GET
APPROVAL,
YOU MUST PAY A $200 TRANSFER TAX. THE BIG MYTH THAT GOES ARROUND IS THAT FULL-
AUTO WEAPONS ARE THEMSELVES EXPENSIVE, THAT'S NOT TRUE, THEY COST JUST AS MUCH
AS THEIR SEMI-AUTO COUNTERPARTS. THE BIG THING THAT MAKES LEGAL FULL-AUTOS
COST
SO MUCH IS THE TAX.

STEPS.

     EVERYTHING YOU DO GOES IN STEPS, AND IT'S THE SAME
WITH GETTING A FULL-AUTO. HERE THEY ARE...

     1. CHOOSE THE GUN YOU WANT. YOU GET FULL-AUTOS FROM CLASS /// GUN
DEALERS.

     2. ADD UP ALL THE COSTS FOR THE RIFLE OR SMG AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
ENOUGH
BUCKS TO PAY FOR IT.

     3. IF YOU ARE UNDER 21 YEARS OF AGE, GET PARENTS PERMISSION TO REGISTER
THE
GUN IN HIS/HERS NAME. THEN PUT HIS/HER NAME ON THE LETTER TO THE BATF.

     4. SAVE THE GUN AT THE CLASS /// DEALERSHIP. ASK OWNER FOR HELP IN
GETTING
BATF'S APPROVAL, THEY CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT, MORE THAN I CAN HERE, AND GET
ALL THE FORMS YOU NEED. REMEMBER, THE DEALERS ARE USUALLY VERY COOPERATIVE,
MAINLY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SELL THEIR GUNS.

     5. GET BATF APPROVAL. PAY $200 TRANSFER TAX(SHOULD ALREADY BE CALCULATED
INTO YOUR EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT--SEE STEP 2).

     6. BUY YOUR FULL-AUTO AND TAKE IT HOME.

     7. TAKE GUN TO SAFE PLACE TO PRACTICE YOUR FIRING, NOW THAT WE WENT
THROUGH
ALL THIS, WE DON'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR DISTURBING THE PEACE, DO WE?

     WELL, THAT IS A VERY BASIC DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO
TO
GET A LEGAL FULL-AUTO. REMEMBER THIS, THOUGH, YOUR GUN IS NOW REGISTERED IN
THE
GOVERNMENT FILES AS A FULL-AUTO HAZZARD TO THEM. BE VERY CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU
GET
CAUGHT DOING WITH YOUR PIECE NOW THAT YOU HAVE IT.

                                    ILLEGAL

     I TOLD YOU THERE WERE TWO WAYS, WELL HERE IS THE OTHER ONE. ILLEGAL. THAT
MEANS IF YOU GET CAUGHT WITH ONE OF THESE YOU WILL GET THE WEAPON CONFISCATED,
AND A MASSIVE FINE. NOW ALL THAT IS GREAT, BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW YOU HAVE ONE
UNLESS YOU DO ONE OF A FEW THINGS THE FEDS HAVE TO TIP THEM OFF TO ILLEGAL
FULL-AUTO OWNERS. ONE IS MAIL-ORDERS. SOME MAIL ORDERS THAT YOU SEND AWAY FOR,
LIKE INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS TO CONVERT CERTAIN GUNS TO FULL- AUTO, ARE JUST
FRONTS
FOR THE FEDS.  THEY SEND YOU THE BOOKLET, GIVE YOU TIME TO MAKE THE
CONVERSION,
THEN COME AND BUST YOU FOR HAVING ILLEGAL FIREARMS. ANOTHER THING THAT TIPS
OFF
THE COPS IS "CONCERNED CITIZENS" THAT HEAR FULL- AUTOS, AND GET SCARED SHIT-
LESS THINKING SOMEONE IS GOING TO BLOW THEM AWAY. THEY CALL THE COPS, AND THEY
COME RUNNING, LOOKING FOR THE OFFENDER.

     I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU A FEW OF THE RISK FACTORS BEFORE I GET
INTO
THE ACTUAL MECHANICS OF GETTING ILLEGAL FULL- AUTOS.  IF YOU PLAY IT SAFE,
THIS
METHOD CAN COST LESS THAN BUYING ONE LEGALLY.  OK, THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO
WAYS
TO GET FULL-AUTOS ILLEGALLY. CONVERT SEMI-AUTOS TO FULL-AUTO, OR SELECTIVE
FIRE,
AND BUYING A PREMADE FULL AUTO ON THE BLACK MARKET.

     I WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY SUGGEST THE SECOND METHOD, YOU GET IN CONTACT WITH
SOME REAL HEAVY DUDES, SOME REAL HARDASSES THAT WOULD JUST AS SOON SHOOT YOU
AS
SELL YOU A GUN. THIS METHOD IS NOT WISE, OR PRUDENT, OR ALL THAT CRAP, BUT I
TOLD YOU ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS THERE, AND IT IS AN OPTION.

     THE CONVERSION OF A SEMI-AUTO TO FULL-AUTO IS USUALLY A COMPLICATED
PROCESS, AND THE METHODS ARE DIFFERENT FOR EACH DIFFERENT KIND OF RIFLES. THE
AR-15/M-16 IS THE ONE EXEPTION TO THIS RULE. IT IS EXTREMELY EASY TO CONVERT
TO
FULL-AUTO. BUT ANYHOW, THE WAY YOU GO THROUGH IT IS YOU FIRST CHOOSE YOURSELF
A
GOOD SEMI-AUTO RIFLE THAT USES A BOX MAGAZINE(ALSO CALLED "CLIP") IT IS ALSO
PREFERABLE TO BUY A WELL KNOWN SEMI-AUTO SO THE CLIPS ARE CHEAP, AND
CONVERSION
PLANS ARE READILY AVAILABLE. A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE UZI, AR-15, MINI-14,
MAC-10, KG-99 OR OTHER GOOD, COMMON GUNS.

     ALL RIGHT, SO NOW YOU HAVE A GUN PICKED OUT IN YOUR MIND. SEND FOR A
MANUAL
THAT EXPLAINS THE PROCEDURE FOR CONVERTING YOUR GUN. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT
WHEN YOU DO THIS, YOU BUY FROM A WELL KNOWN PUBLISHER LIKE PALADIN PRESS, OR
BILL MOORE PUBLICA- TIONS. OK NOW, VERY CAREFULLY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO
THE
LETTER. YOU DO NOT WANT OT SCREW UP YOUR FIREARM BY GRINDING IN THE WRONG
PLACE,
OR THROWING AWAY THE WRONG PART.

      THIS IS BASICALLY ALL I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED
PROCEDURE THAT TAKES ALOT OF TIME TO EXPLAIN, BUT I CAN GIVE SOMETHING OF USE
TO
ALL OF YOU WHO OWN A MINI-14. YOU KNOW, MADE BY RUGER. WHEN I TELL YOU THIS, I
AM ASSUMING YOU KNOW AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR GUN. IF YOU DON'T KNOW A
FUCK ABOUT THE INSIDES OF THE MINI-14 LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE! I DON'T WANT
YOU
TO SCREW IT UP ON ACCOUNT OF ME.

     OK, LOOK IN THE MANUAL THAT CAME WITH YOUR GUN. THERE IS A PART CALLED
THE
SECONDARY SEAR. THIS IS WHAT PREVENTS YOUR MINI FROM BEING MIGHTY. TAKE APART
THE MECHANISM AND REMOVE THE SECONDARY SEAR & THE SPRING BEHIND IT. REASSEMBLE
THE MECHANISM, MAKING SURE YOU DON'T FORGET TO PUT ALL THE OTHER PIECES IN
THEIR
RIGHT PLACES. YOUR RIFLE IS NOW A SLAM-FIRING FULL AUTO. KEEP THE SECONDARY
SEAR, IN A SAFE PLACE, BECAUSE TO CONVERT IT BACK TO SEMI- AUTO, AND BACK TO
LEGAL, YOU JUST PUT IN THE SECONDARY SEAR. REMEMBER, THIS METHOD IS THE
"CHEAPO"
AND CONVERTS YOUR MINI TO FULL-AUTO ONLY. WHEN YOU LOAD IT UP AND PULL THE
TRIGGER, IT WILL FIRE ABOUT TWO SHOTS IF YOU JUST SNAP THE TRIGGER AND RELEASE
IT QUICKLY.  DO NOT HOLD THE TRIGGER DOWN!!!! THIS WILL CAUSE THE FIREARM TO
BECOME UNCONTROLABLE, AND THUS DANGEROUS TO YOURSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS.

     THAT'S ALL FOR NOW, BUT BE LOOKING FOR MY FOLLOW-UP ARTICLES ON HOW TO
CONVERT UZIS, AR-15S, AND KG-99S.  STAY SANE, AND KILL A COMMIE FOR MOMMIE!

     I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED TO THIS TO THE FULLEST! LATER,

                                THE ANGEL OF DESTINY.

+-------------------------------------+
! KING ARTHUR'S DEMOLITION ARTICLE #1 !
+-------------------------------------+

     LIKE ALL CHEMISTS I MUST ADVISE
YOU ALL TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE AND
CAUTION WHEN YOU ARE DOING THIS.  EVEN
IF YOU HAVE MADE THIS STUFF BEFORE.

     THIS FIRST ARTICLE WILL GIVE YOU
INFORMATION ON MAKING NITROGLYERIN, THE
BASIC INGREDIENT IN A LOT OF EXPLOSIVES
SUCH AS STRAIGHT DYNAMITES, AND GELETIN
DYNAMITES.

---------------------------------------

MAKING NITROGLYCERIN

---------------------------------------

     1. FILL A 75-MILLILITER BEAKER TO
THE 13 ML. LEVEL WITH FUMING RED NITRIC
ACID, OF 98% PURE CONCENTRATION.

     2. PLACE THE BEAKER IN AN ICE BATH
AND ALLOW TO COOL BELOW ROOM TEMP.

     3. AFTER IT HAS COOLED, ADD TO IT
THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FUMING
SULFERIC ACID (99% H2SO4).  IN OTHER
WORDS, ADD TO THE NOW-COOL FUMING
NITRIC ACID 39 ML. OF FUMING SULFERIC
ACID.  WHEN MIXING ANY ACIDS, ALWAYS
DO IT SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY TO AVOID
SPLATTERING.

     4. WHEN THE TWO ARE MIXED, LOWER
THIER TEMP. BY ADDING MORE ICE TO THE
BATH, ABOUT 10-15 DEGREES CENTIGRADE.
(USE A MERCURY-OPERATED THERMOMETER)

     5. WHEN THE ACID SOLUTION HAS
COOLED TO THE DESIRED TEMPERATURE, IT
IS READY FOR THE GLYCERIN. THE GLYCERIN
MUST BE ADDED IN SMALL AMOUNTS USING
A MEDICINE DROPPER.  (READ THIS STEP
ABOUT 10 TIMES!)  GLYCERIN IS ADDED
SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY (I MEAN CAREFUL!)
UNTIL THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE ACID
IT COVERED WITH IT.

     6. THIS IS A DANGEROUS POINT SINCE
THE NITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE AS SOON
AS THE GLYCERIN IS ADDED. THE NITRATION
WILL PRODUCE HEAT, SO THE SOLUTION MUST
BE KEPT BELOW 30 DEGREES CENTIGRADE!
IF THE SOLUTION SHOULD GO ABOVE 30
DEGREES,  IMMEDIATELY DUMP THE SOLUTION
INTO THE ICE BATH!  THIS WILL INSURE
THAT IT DOES NOT GO OFF IN YOUR FACE!

     7. FOR HTE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF
NITRATION, THE MIXTURE SHOULD BE
GENTLY STIRRED.  IN A NORMAL REACTION
THE NITROGLYCERIN WILL FORMAS A LAYER
ON TOP OF THE ACID SOLUTION, WHILE THE
SULFERIC ACID WILL ABSORB THE EXCESS
WATER.

     8. AFTER THE NITRATION HAS TAKEN
PLACE, AND THE NITROGLYCERIN HAS
FORMED ON THE TOP OF THE SOLUTION, THE
ENTIRE BEAKER SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED
SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY TO ANOTHER BEAKER
OF WATER.  WHEN THIS IS DONE THE
NITROGLYCERIN WILL SETTLE AT THE
BOTTEM SO THE OTHER ACIDS CAN BE
DRAINED AWAY.

     9. AFTER REMOVING AS MUCH ACID
AS POSIBLE WITHOUT DISTURBING THE
NITROGLYCERIN, REMOVE THE NITROGLYCERIN
WITH AN EYEDROPPER AND PLACE IT IN A
BICARBONATE OF SODA (SODIUM BICARBONATE
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW) SOLUTION.  THE
SODIUM IS AN ALKALAI AND WILL
NUETRALIZE MUCH OF THE ACID REMAINING.
THIS PROCESS SHOULD BE REPEATED AS MUCH
AS NECESARRY USING BLUE LITMUS PAPER
TO CHECK FOR THE PRESENCE OF ACID.  THE
REMAINING ACID ONLY MAKES THE NITROGLY-
CERIN MORE UNSTABLE THAN IT ALREADY IS.

     10. FINALLY! THE FINAL STEP IS TO
REMOVE THE NITROGLYCERIN FROM THE BI-
CARBONATE.  HIS IS DONE WITH AND EYE-
DROPPER, SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY.  THE
USUAL TEST TO SEE IF NITRATION HAS
BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS TO PLACE ONE DROP OF
THE NITROGLYCERIN ON METAL AND IGNITE
IT.  IF IT IS TRUE NITROGLYCERIN IT
WILL BURN WITH A CLEAR BLUE FLAME.

** CAUTION **
NITRO IS VERY SENSATIVE TO DECOMPOSI-
TION, HEATING DROPPING, OR JARRING,
AND MAY EXPLODE IF LEFT UNDISTURBED AND
COOL.

     I have decided to skip the article
on mercury fluminate for a while and
get right into the dynamite article.
     Dynamite is nothing more than just
nitroglycerin and a stablizing agent to
make it much safer to use.  For the
sake of saving time, I will abbreviate
nitroglycerin with a plain NG.  The
numbers are percentages, be sure to mix
these carefully and be sure to use the
exact amounts.  These percentages are
in weight ratio, not volume.

sucrose                    cane sugar
zinc chloride          tinner's fluid

     Keep this list handy at all times.
If you can't seem to get one or more of
the ingredients try another one.  If
you still can't, you can always buy
small amounts from your school, or
maybe from various chemical companies.
When you do that, be sure to say as
little as possible, if during the
school year, and they ask, say it's
for a experiment for school.

     Again, I hate to bore ya, but be
sure to follow instructions carefully.
  If you fail to do so, your parents
might have to pick up your ashes.

     This article will cover the production of plastic explosives of the type
'C-2' and 'C-3'.  These are highly undesirable because of certain trait each
has
and they don't produce as much power as 'C' and 'C-4' compounds.

     It is not recamended you make these two types of plastique, this article
was written for imformatative purposes only.  (Just so you can act like you
know
what you are doing).

     Composition 'C-2' is harder to make than 'C-4' and is TOXIC TO HANDLE. 
It
is also unstable in storage and is poor choice for home explosive manufature.
It
also has a lower detonation velocity than either 'C-4' or 'C-3'.

     It is manufactured in a steam jacketed (heated) melting kettle using the
same procedure used in incorperation of 'C-3'.  Its composition is as follows:

R.D.X................. 80%
  (Equal parts of them following:)
        Mononitrotolulene
        Dinitrotolulene
        T.N.T. guncotton
        Dimethylformide......... 20%

           (See Below for rest of recipe)

     'C-3' was developed to eliminate the undesirable aspects of 'C-2'.  It
was
standardized and adopted by the military as following composition:

R.D.X................ 77%
Mononitrotolulene.... 16%
Dinitrotolulene......  5%
Tetryl...............  1%
T.N.T. guncotton.....  1%

     'C-3' is manufactured by mixing the plastisizing agent in a steam
jacketed
melting kettle equipped with a mechanical stirring attachment.  The kettle is
heated to 90-100 degrees Celcius and the stirrer is activated.  Water wet
R.D.X.
is added to the plastisizing agent and the stirring is continued until a
uniform
mixture is obtained and all water has been driven off.  Remove the heat source
but continue to stir the mixture until it has cooled to room temperature.

     This explosive is as sensitive to impact as is T.N.T.  Storage at 65
degrees Celcius for four months at a relative humidity of 95% does not impair
it's explosive properties.

     'C-3' is 133% as good as an explosive as good as an explsive as is T.N.T.
The major drawback of 'C-3' is its volatility which causes it to lose 1.2% of
its weight although the explosives detonation properties are not affected.

     Water does not affect explosives preformance.  It therefore is very good
for under-water demolition uses and would be a good choice for such an
application.

    When stored at 77 degrees Celcius considerable extrudation takes place. 
It
will become hard at -29 degrees Celcius and is hard to detonate at this
temperature.

    While this explosive is not unduely toxic, it should be handled with care
as it contains aryl-nitro compounds which are absorbed through the skin.

    It will reliably take detonation from a #6 blasting cap but the use of a
booster is always suggested.  This explosive has a great blast effect and was
still is avaliable in standard demolition blocks.

    Its detonation velocity is approximately 7700 M/second.

     Nitroglycerin <heretofore Nitro>
is a very powerful high explosive.  I
am not sure who invented it but he
probably didn't -- the first person to
make it probably blew himself up and
his friend got the info off his notes.
Well anyway, the next best thing to
Nitro is TNT which is ten times harder
to make but also ten times safer to
make.  If you can't use it then don't
even TRY to make this stuff!!!

To Make Nitro:
     Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid
(for best results it should have a
specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume')
with 200 parts sulphuric acid.  This is
going to be HOT at first -- it won't
splatter if you pour the nitric INTO
the sulphuric but don't try it the
other way around.  The acid solutions
together can disolve flesh in a matter
of seconds so take the proper measures
for God's sake!!!  When cool, add 38
parts glycerine as slowly as possible.
Let it trickle down the sides of the
container into the acids or it won't
mix thouroughly and the reaction could
go to fast -- which causes enough heat
to ignite the stuff.  Stir with a
**GLASS** rod for 15 seconds or so then
CAREFULLY pour it into 20 time it's
volume of water.  It will visibly
precipitate immediately.  There will be
twice as much Nitro as you used
glycerin and it is easy to separate.
Mix it with baking soda as soon as you
have separated it -- this helps it not
to go off spontainiously.

NOTES:
     Parts are by weight and the Baume'
scale of specific gravity can be found
in most chem. books.  You can get
fuming nitric and sulfuric acid
wherever good chemicals or fertilizers
are sold.  It is positively *STUPID*
to make more than 200 grams of Nitro at
a time.  When mixing the stuff wear
goggles, gloves, etc.  When I first
made the stuff I had the honor of
having it go off by itself (I added
too much glycerine at the time.) I was
across the room at the time, but I felt
the impact -- so did the table it was
on as well as the window it was next to
--- they were both smashed by only 25
grams in an open bowl.)  Oh, yes,
glycerine you can get at any pharmacy
and you need no adult signature for the
acids.  Any bump can make Nitro go off
if you don't add the bicarbonate
(baking soda) -- but even with that,
if it gets old I wouldn't play catch
with it.

     Once you have made the Nitro and
saturated it with Bicarb. you can make
a really powerful explosive that won't
go off by itself by simply mixing it
with as much cotton as you can and then
saturating that with molten (parifine
-- just enought to make it sealed and
hard.)  Typically use the same amounts
(by weight) of each Nitro, cotton and
parifine.  This, when wrapped in
newspaper, was once know as "Norbin &
Ohlsson's Patent Dynamite," but that
was back in 1896.

**Carefully** mix equal amounts of
nitric acid and sulphuric acid togther
in a graduated cylinder or other tall,
thin container.  Slowly add ordinary
glycerin a stir very lightly.  Wait a
while, and pour off the liquid on top.
This liquind is nitroglycerine, and
should be handeled with caution.
Washing it with sodium carbonate will
improve the purity.

As for the use of what you just made
let me know......

               WRITTEN BY..

              THE ARCHITECT
--------------------------------------

The growing world of household weapons
would not be complete without the 
infamous PEN GUN. This versatile weapon
which doubles as a household pen, can
be shot up to 2 feet and still do sub
stantial damage to the enemies' eyes
or what not.

STEP 1: acquire a "push pen", one that
snaps in and out when you press the 
back of the pen.

STEP 2: next, disassemble this pen so that you have the 4 parts needed to fire
your semi-automatic weapon.

1> the pusher (found in the back)
2> the little pusher (found in the pusher)
3> the spring (found on top of the ink case)
4> the ink case (the long thing with ink in it)

Once you have discovered these parts.
arrange them in such a way so that you
can see each of the parts.

STEP 4: now, you must follow these 
instructions closely.

1> put the pusher in it's old place. 
be sure not to put the little pusher in
it!
2> put the spring in next (all this goes in the back of the pen)
3> on top of the spring goes the little
pusher. 
4> put the ink case on top of the little
pusher and replace the front. (this
cram all of the little parts together
and make them stick in there.
5> remove the top. and leave the ink case
in, as this will be the pain inflicting
element.

To activate this little gun, just push
the pusher! (some extra force may be
required)

This little weapon/writing utensil, can
be used to write a paper or blind an
enemy! It's also good for shooting the
person in front of you in class (be 
sure he's wearing thick clothes unless
you want to hurt him)

Enjoy!

                        HOW TO MAKE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES

A PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER CAN BE MADE FROM POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND PETROLEUM
JELLY. THIS EXPLOSIVE CAN BE DETONATED IN ANY MILITARY BLASTING CAP. (FIND A
FRIEND IN THE SERVICE OR IN THE RESERVE, OR STEAL ONE).

MATERIALS:
----------
POTASSIUM CHLORATE - THIS CHEMICAL IS USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES, AND IN
                     THE MANUFACTURE OF MATCHES.

PETROLEUM JELLY - JUST GET SOME VASELINE OR NO-NAME BRAND.

PIECE OF ROUND STICK

WIDE BOWL OR OTHER CONTAINER FOR MIXING INGREDIENTS.


PROCEDURE:
----------
1) SPREAD THE POT. NIT. CRYSTALS THINLY ON A HARD SURFACE.  ROLL THE ROUND
STICK
   OVER THE CRYSTALS TO CRUSH INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHEAT FLOUR.

2) PLACE 9 PARTS POWDERED POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND 1 PART PETROLEUM JELLY IN A
   WIDE BOWL OR SILILAR CONTAINER.  MIX THE INGREDIENTS WITH YOUR HANDS
(KNEAD)
   UNTIL A UNIFORM PASTE IS OBTAINED.

STORE THE EXPLOSIVE IN A WATERPROOF CONTAINER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO USE IT.



PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES-

    MIX 7 PARTS POTASSIUM CHLORATE FOR EVERY ONE PART OF PETROLEUUM JELLY
    (VASELINE WILL DO) THEN USE AN ELECTRIC CHARGE OR A FUSE.

NITRO IODIDE-

    OK, THIS IS HOW TO MAKE NITRIC IODIDE. MIX SOME SOLID IODINE WITH
    HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA. WAIT OVERNIGHT. POUR OFF THE LIQUID. LET THE MUD FROM
    THE BOTTOM DRY ON A HARD SURFACE OUTSIDE LIKE CONCRETE. THROW SOMETHING ON
    IT. IT WILL GO OFF AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE BECAUSE IT IS SO UNSTABLE.

KITCHEN IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES
BY TIM LEWIS PART II  RDX MANUFACTURE

RDX IS THE MAIN INGREDIANT IN THE REST
OF THE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES I WILL COVER.
THE PRODUCTION OF RDX IS VERY DANGEROUS
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY OF THIS IF YOU WISH
TO LIVE TILL YOUR NEXT BIRTHDAY!

SINCE THE FIRST PART OF WWII THE ARMED
FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
SEARCHING FOR THE PERFECT PLASTIQUE
EXPLOSIVES TO BE USED IN DEMOLITION
WORK. THIS SEARCH LEAD TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE 'C' COMPOSITION
PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVES. OF THIS GROUP
C-4 BEING THE LASTEST FORMULATION THAT
HAS BEEN READILY ADOPTED BY THE ARMED
FORCES. THIS FORMULATION WAS PRECEDED
BY C-3, C-2, AND C.

IN THIS SERIES OF ARTICLES, I WILL
COVER ALL THESE EXPLOSIVES IN THEIR
CHRONOLOGICAL PROGRESSION AS THEY WERE
DEVELOPED AND STANDARDIZED BY THE ARMED
FORCES. ALL THESE EXPLOSIVES ARE
CYCLONITE OR R.D.X. BASE WITH VARIOUS
PLASTISIZING AGENTS USED TO ACHIEVE THE
DESIRED PRODUCT.
THIS PLASTISIZER, USUALLY COMPOSES
7%-20% OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE
PLASTIQUE.
CYCLOTRIMETHYLENETRINITTRIME OR
CYCLONITE IS MANUFACTURED IN BULK BY
THE NITRATION OF
HEXAMETHYLENETETRAMINE, (METHENAMINE,
HEXAMINE, ETC., ETC.) WITH STRONG RED
100% NITRIC ACID.
THE HARDEST PART OF THIS REACTION IS
OBTAINING THIS RED NITRIC ACID. IT WILL
MOST LIKELY HAVE TO BE MADE. MORE ON
THIS LATER.
HEXAMINE OR METHENAMINE CAN USUALLY BE
BOUGHT IN BULK QUANTITIES OR HEXAMINE
FUEL BARS FOR CAMP STOVES CAN BE USED
BUT THEY END UP BEING VERY EXPLENSIVE.
TO USE THE FUEL BARS THE NEED TO BE
POWERED BEFORE HAND.
THE HEXAMINE CAN ALSO BE MADE WITH
COMMON AMMONIA WATER (30%) AND THE
COMMONLY AVALIABLE 36% FORMALDEHYDE
SOLUTION. TO MAKE THIS COMPONANT PLACE
185 GRAMS OF CLEAR AMMONIA WATER IN A
SHALLOW PYREX DISH. TO THIS ADD 500ML
OF THE FORMALDEHYDE SOLUTION TO THE
AMMONIA WATER. ALLOW THIS TO EVAPORATE
AND WHEN THE CRYSTALS ARE ALL THAT
REMAINS IN THE PAN PLACE THE PAN IN THE
OVEN ON THE LOWEST HEAT THAT THE OVEN
HAS. THIS SHOULD BE DONE ONLY FOR A
MOMENT OR SO TO DRIVE OFF ANY REMAINING
WATER. THESE CRYSTALS ARE SCRAPED UP
AND PLACED IN A AIRTIGHT JAR TO STORE
THEM UNTIL THEY ARE USED.
TO MAKE THE RED NITRIC ACID YOU WILL
NEED TO BUY A RETORT WITH A GROUND
GLASS STOPPER.  IN THE RETORT PLACE 32
GRAMS SULFURIC ACID, (98%-100%), AND TO
THIS ADD 68 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM NITRATE
OR 58 GRAMS OF SODIUM NITRATE.  GENTLY
HEATING THIS RETORT WILL GENERATE A RED
 GAS CALLED NITROGEN TRIOXIDE. THIS GAS
IS HIGHLY POISONOUS AND THIS STEP, AS
WITH ALL OTHER STEPS, SHOULD BE DONE WI
TH GOOD VENTILATION.
THIS NITRIC ACED THAT IS FORMED WILL
COLLECT IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND
FORM DROPLETS THAT WILL RUN DOWN THE
INSIDE OF THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND
SHOULD BE CAUGHT IN A BEAKER COOLED BY
BEING SURROUNDED BY ICE WATER.
 
THIS SHOULD BE HEATED TILL NO MORE
COLLECTS IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND
THE NITRIC ACID QUITS DRIPPING OUT OF
THE NECK INTO THE BEAKER.
THIS ACID SHOULD BE STORED UNTIL ENOUGH
ACID IS GENERATED TO PRODUCE THE
REQUIRED SIZE BATCH WHICH IS DETERMINED
BY THE PERSON PRODUCING THE ECPLOSIVE.
OF COURSE THE BATCH CAN BE LARGER OR
SMALLER BUT THE SAME RATIONS SHOULD BE
MAINTAINED.
TO MAKE R.D.X. PLACE 550 GRAMS OF THE
NITRIC ACID PRODUCED BY THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE IN A 1000 ML. BEAKER IN A SAL
TED BATH. 50 GRAMS OF HEXAMINE,
(METHENAMINE) IS ADDED IN SMALL
PORTIONS MAKING SURE THAT THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE ACID DOES NOT GO
ABOVE 30 DEGREES CELCIUS. THIS
TEMPERATURE CAN BE MONITORED BY PLACING
A THERMOMETER DIRECTLY IN THE ACID
MIXTURE. DURING THIS PROCEDURE A
VIGEROUS STIRRING SHOULD BE MAINTAINED.
IF THE TEMPERATURE APPROCHES 30
DEGREES, IMMEDIATLY STOP THE ADDITION
OF THE HEXAMINE UNTIL THE
TEMPERATURE DROPS TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL.
AFTER THE ADDITION IS COMPLETE CONTINUE
THE STIRRING AND ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE
TO DROP TO 0 DEGREES CELCIUS AND ALLOW
IT TO STAY THERE FOR 20 MINUTES
CONINUING THE VIGEROUS STIRRING. AFTER
THE 20 MINUTES ARE UP, POUR THIS
ACID-HEXAMINE MIXTURE INTO 1000 ML. OF
FINELY CRUSHED ICE AND WATER.
CRYSTALS SHOULD FORM AND ARE FILTERED
OUT OF THE LIQUID.
THE CRYSTALS THAT ARE FILTERED OUT ARE
R.D.X. AND WILL NEED TO HAVE ALL
TRACES OF THE ACID REMOVED. TO REMOVE
THIS TRACE OF ACID, FIRST WASH THESE
CRYSTALS BY PUTTING THEM IN ICE WATER
AND SHAKING AND REFILTERING. THESE
CRYSTALS ARE THEN PLACED IN A LITTLE
BOILING WATER AND FILTERED. PLACE THEM
IN SOME WARM WATER AND CHECK THE
ACIDITY FOR THE RESULTANT SUSPENSION
WITH LITMUS PAPER. YOU WANT IT TO READ
BETWEEN 6 AND 7 ON THE PH SCALE. IF
THERE IS STILL ACID IN THESE CRYSTALS
REBOIL THEM IN FRESH WATER UNTIL THE
ACID IS REMOVED AND THE LITMUS PAPER
SHOWS THEM BETWEEN 6 AND 7, (THE CLOSER
TO 7 THE BETTER).
TO BE SAFE THESE CRYSTALS SHOULD BE
STORED WATER WET UNTIL READY FOR USE.
THESE CRYSTALS ARE A VERY HIGH
EXPLOSIVE AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH
THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE! THIS
EXPLOSIVE IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN
T.N.T.
TO USE, THESE WILL NEED TO BE DRYED FOR
SOME MANUFATURING PROCESSES IN THE NEXT
FEW ARTICLES. TO DRY THESE CRYSTALS,
PLACE THEM IN A PAN AND SPREAD THEM
OUT AND ALLOW THE WATER TO EVAPORATE
OFF THEM UNTIL THE ARE COMPLETELY DRY.
THIS EXPLOSIVE WILL DETONATE IN THIS
DRY FORM WHEN PRESSED INTO A MOLD TO
A DENSITY OF 1.55 GRAMS CUBED, AT A
VELOCITY OF 8550 M/SECOND!

                              Pool Phun
                         By: Long John Silver

                          The Police Station
                             612-934-4880


     First of all, you need know nothing about pools.  The only thing
you need to know is what a pool filter looks like.

     Second, dress casual.  Preferably, in black.  Visit your
"friends" house, the one whose pool looks like fun!!)  Then you
reverse the polarity of his/her pool, by switching the wires around.
They are located in the back of the pump. This will have quite an
effect when the pump goes on.  In other words. Boooooooooooommm!
Thats right, when you mix + wires with - plugs, and vice- versa, the
4th of July happens again.

     Not into total destruction??? When the pump is off, switch the
pump to "backwash".  Turn the pump on and get the phuck out!  When you
look the next day, phunny.  The pool is dry.  If you want permanant
damage, yet no great display like my first one mentioned, shut the
valves of the pool off. (There are usually 2)  One that goes to the
main drain and one that goes to the filter in the pool.  That should
be enough to have one dead pump.  The pump must take in water, so when
there isn't any...

     Practical jokes:  These next ones deal with true friends and
there is *no* permanent damage done.  If you have a pool, you must
check the pool with chemicals.  There is one labeled orthotolidine.
The other is labeled alkaline (ph).  You want orthotolidine. (It
checks the chlorine).  Go to your local pool store and tell them
you're going into the pool business, and to sell you orthotolidine (a
CL detector)   Buy this in great quantities if possible.  The solution
is clear.  You fill 2 baggies with this chemical.  And sew the bags to
the inside of your suit.  Next, go swimming with your friend!  Then
open the bags and look like you're enjoying a piss.  And anyone there
will turn a deep red!  They will be embarrased so much, Especially if
they have guests there! Explain what it is, then add vinegar to the
pool.  Only a little.  The "piss" disappears.





         POTASSIUM NITRATE


     MORE THINGS TO DO WITH POTASSIUM
NITRATE (BESIDES GUN POWDER). WELL A 
GREAT THING TO DO IS TO MIX IT 50%
WITH SUGAR AND PUT IT IN A TIN CAN WITH THE TOP SAWED OFF. MIX IT WELL THEN
LIGT
AND MAKE A LOT OF SMOKE. IT WILL MELT 
CAN TO THE GROUND. FOR THE PURISTS
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE POTASSIUM
NITRATE IS OXIDIZING THE SUGAR WHICH
AND GOOD BIO STUDENT KNOWS HAS HIGH
ENERGY IN IT!!! SO WATCH WHAT IS HAPPENINGIN YOUR BODY AND A SLIGHTLY
ACCELERAT.

     Today boys and girls we will tell you all about having fun with a few
simple items that you can buy easily or may even have in your home.

     Since most of you are simple-minded, uncoordinated morons, I will start
you
out slowly and simply (like you).

     Our first project is a sure fire way to be the life of the party.  Real
sure fire.  This item is called a "Handy House Warmer."  All you need are
three
items which can easily be obtained.  The first item is a roll of electrical
tape
(starts easy).  Second, a large can of Sterno, easily bought at any camping or
hardware store.  Third, an M-80 or other similar explosive plaything.

     Step one in the construction of our pyrotecnic wonder is to remove the
top
of the sterno and, using an ice pick or other sharp item, punch a hole in the
top of the can.  Step two is placing the M-80 into the sterno gel.  Make sure
it
is well covered by the gel.  Step three is to replace the cap, making sure to
thread the M-80 fuse through the hole in the cap.  After securing the lid
tightly on the can, you can start the final phase to fun.  The last step is
simply to wind tape tightly around the entire can, making sure to cover it
completely with at least three layers of tape but not more than six layers.

     Now, as you can tell, when you go to use our incendiary toy to cheaply
and
efficiently heat any home in your neighborhood, all you have to do is light
the
fuse and run.  The other advantages of this are that Sterno sticks to almost
anything and is very difficult to put out, needing to be completely smothered,
and that Sterno is highly prone to reignition (very similar to napalm).  This
type of firecracker is handy in small areas such as inside cars, small rooms,
phone booths, rectums, etc...

     Now, I am not advocating the use of this item for anything but your own
personal fireworks displays and enjoyment, but where and what you call
enjoyment
I won't judge.

     Well, boys and girls, that's all for today.  Hope you enjoyed our time
together and remember my motto:  DEATH IS JUST A STATE OF MIND.

                                 BY: MR. DEATH

     HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO BUILD YOUR OWN WARHEAD CARRYING ROCKET? WELL NOW
YOU CAN WITH THE NEW "BLOW-EM-UP" ROCKET BOMB PLANS FROM MR. DEATH. FIRST YOU
MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPERIENCE IN MODEL ROCKETRY. THEN GO OUT AND BUY A "D"
OR "E" ENGINE ROCKET THAT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.

     MAKE THE ROCKET LIKE THEY SAY AND THEN FILL THE NOSE CONE WITH SOME
SUBSTANCE THAT HAS THE SAME WEIGHT OR CLOSE TO FLASH-POWDER. DETACH THE NOSE
CONE FROM THE SHOCK CORD SO THAT ONLY THE BODY WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE
PARACHUTE. GET A GOOD STOPWATCH AND A PAIR OF GOOD BINOCULARS AND LAUNCH THE
ROCKET STRAIGHT UP. WATCH THE ROCKET AND START TIMING WHEN THE EJECTION CHARGE
BLOWS THE CONE FREE AND STOP TIMING RIGHT WHEN THE CONE IMPACTS ON THE GROUND.

     THEN RETRIEVE THE BODY AND GET ANOTHER NOSE CONE. FILL THE NOSE CONE WITH
FLASH POWDER AND BLOCK UP THE HOLE WITH MODEL CEMENT. MAKE SURE TO HAVE A NICE
LITTLE FUSE STICKING OUT OF THE CEMENT. THAT FUSE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SMALLER
THAN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK FOR IMPACT. (SMALLER TIME-WISE) FIGURE THAT IF
IT TOOK 30 SEC. TO FALL THEN THE FUSE SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ABOUT 25 SEC. NOW
THIS IS GOOD FOR A BOMB THAT WILL GO STRAIGHT UP AND COME STRAIGHT DOWN. NOW
IF
YOU WANT TO SHOOT IT ON AN ANGLE, THEN YOU MUST USE SOME FORMULA TO FIGURE OUT
HOW HIGH THE ROCKET WILL BE WHEN EJECTION OCCURS SO THAT YOU CAN TIME YOUR
FUSE
RIGHT. REMEMBER TO USE A NO-TIME DELAY ENGINE SO THAT THE EJECTION CHARGE WILL
OCCUR IMMEDIATELY. HAVE FUN.

   This is an anti-personnel bomb meant for milling crowds. The bottom of a
soft
drink can is half cut out and bent back. A giant firecracker or other
explosive
is put in and surrounded with nuts and bolts or rocks. The fuse is then armed
with a chemical delay in a plastic drinking straw.

   After first making sure there are no children nearby, the acid or glycerine
is put into the straw and the can is set down by a tree or wall where it will
not be knocked over. The delay should give you three to five minutes. It will
then have a shattering effect on passerbys.

   It is hardly likely that anyone would pick up and drink from someone else's
soft drink can. But if such a crude person should try to drink from your bomb
he would break a nasty habit fast!

STINKUM:  FROM THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND BY KURT SAXON TYPED BY THE PENGUIN

IRON SULFIDE IS SOLD FOR $.35 FOR ONLY 1/8TH OF AN OUNCE. EASIER TO MAKE AND
JUST AS POTENT AND COSTING ABOUT $.50 A QUART IS AMMONIUM SULFIDE. IT STINKS
TO HIGH HEAVEN LIKE ROTTEN EGGS AND NO ONE CAN STAND TO STAY AROUND IT ONCE IT
HAS BEEN SPILLED ON THE FLOOR OR VAPORIZED BY AN EXPLOSION.

TO MAKE SOME, YOU MIX 4 OUNCES OF SULFE R WITH 8 OUNCES OF HYDRATED LIME
IN A STEW POT. A QUART OF WATER IS ADDED AND THE MESS IS HEATED AND
STIRRED UNTIL THE SULFER HAS COMPLETELY BLENDED. THE HYDRATED LIME WILL SINK
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AND THE YELLOW LIQUID IS THEN POURED OFF INTO A
BUCKET

TAKE THE BUCKET OUTSIDE, IF YOU HAVE ANY SENSE, AND ADD 1 POUND OF SULFATE
OF AMMONIA. STIR IT A MINUTE AND HOLD YOUR NOSE. THEN COVER THE BUCKET WITH
PLASTIC WRAP AND LET IT SET FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. THEN POUR OFF THE LIQUID
SLOWLY THROUGH A CLOTH FILTER INTO A BOTTLE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN OUTSIDE
YOU CAN USE YOUR BATHROOM, JUST HOPE NO ONE HAS TO GO FOR AN HOUR OR SO. THE
LIQUID IS VILE BUT NOT POISON.

A 5 POUND BAG OF SULFATE OF AMMONIA FOR $1.65 CAN BE BOUGHT AT ANY GARDEN
STORE
AND GARDEN SULFER IS VERY HIGH GRADE AND MAKES EXCELLENT GUN POWDER. IT HAS
10% INERT INGREDIENTS SO 10% MORE SHOULD BE ADDED TO ANY FORMULA REQUIR-
ING SULFER. I BOUGHT THE HYDRATED LIME FROM A BUILDING SUPPLY STORE FOR $.10
A POUND.

STINKUM IS EITHER POURED ON THE FLOOR, SHOT FROM A WATER PISTOL, THROWN IN A
BOTTLE OR LIGHT BULB OR VAPORIZED BY A FIRECRACKER. THE SAME GOES FOR THE
FORMALDEHYDE OR ACROLEIN. TO VAPORIZE THE ABOVE NASTIES, A LITTLE BOMB IS
USED. THE BEST BOMB CASING IS A PLASTIC COIN HOLDER WITH A SCREW CAP. THESE
CAN
BE BOUGHT FROM ANY COIN SHOP FOR $.10 EACH. THE THIN BRASS TUBING IS BOUGHT
AT A HOBBY SHOP. THE WAX IS BOUGHT AT A GROCERY IN THE CANNING SECTION. TO
KEEP
THE FIRECRACKER FROM GETTING WET, DIP IT AND PART OF THE TUBING INTO MELTED
WAX. ENOUGH GOODY IS POURED INTO THE COIN HOLDER TO MAKE IT FULL WHEN THE
FIRECRACKER IS PUT IN AND THE LID IS SCREWED ON. IT IS FILLED AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE BEFORE USING.

IT IS IGNITED WITH A CHEMICAL IGNITER, SHOWN FURTHER ON, OR WITH A MATCH OR
CIGARETTE. THE SAME SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN A GLASS BOTTLE BUT THAT MIGHT INJURE
SOMEONE.

   THERE ARE SEVERAL EYE AND NOSE
IRRITANTS ON THE MARKET WHICH CANB BE
EASILY DUPLICATED.

   A GOOD IRRITANT IS FORMALDEHYDE.
BETTER KNOWN AS EMBALMING FLUID, IT
SMELLS HORRIBLE, HURTS THE EYES AND
NOSE, ANDB ON EXPOSURE TO THE AIR IT
VAPORIZES, MAKING A ROOM UNINHABITABLE
FOR HOURS.

   IT CAN BE SQUIRTED FROM A WATER
PISTOL OR NASAL INHALER, POURED ON THE
FLOOR OR VAPORIZED BY A BOMB DESCRIBED
IN THE STINKUM PHILE.

   FORMALDEHYDE CAN BE BOUGHT AT THE
DRUG STORE UNDER THE PRETEXT OF WANTING
IT TO PRESERVE MICE OR OTHER LAB
SPECIMEN.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   THE IRRITANT MAILMEN USE AGAINST
DOGS AND WHICH IS SOLD WIDELY FOR SELF
DEFENSE IS OLEORESID CAPSICUM. CAPSICUM
IS THE HOT ESSENCE OF RED PEPPERS.
OLEORESIN IS THE PROCESS FOR EXTRACTING
IT. TO EXTRACT THE CAPSICUM, GRIND UP
FOUR OUNCES OF RED PEPPER SEEDS IN A
BLENDER OR WITH A MORTAR ANDB PESTLE.
RED PEPPER SEEDS ARE BOUGHT IN THE
GROCERS'S.

   THE DRY, GROUND SEEDS ARE THEN PUT
INTO A COFFEE PERCOLATOR IN WHICH THERE
IS AOBUT 16 OUNCES OF ALOHOL,PREFERABLY
WITH THE WATER DISTILLED OUT. THE SEEDS
ARE THEN PERCOLATED FOR ABOUT A HALF
HOUR. THE ALCOHOL IS THEN DISTILLED OFF
UNTIL THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF TABLE
SPOONS OF RED LIQUID LEFT IN THE FLASK.
THE RED LIQUID IS THEN ADDED TO A HALF
PINT OF LIGHT MINERAL OIL, BOUGHT AT A
DRUG STORE.

   IT CAN BE SPRAYED FROM A NASAL SPRAY
. ANOTHER GOOD WAY IS WITH A WINDOW
CLEANING SPRAYER BOUGHT AT ANY DIME
STORE. THE TUBE OF THE SPRAYER IS CUT
TO FIT IN A TWO OUNCE MIDICINE BOTTLE.
THIS WAY YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THE GOODY
TO LAST THROUGH A WHOLE DEMONSTRATION,
NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU'RE ON. IT IS
ALSO NICE TO KEEP BY THE DOOR OR BY
YOUR COMPUTER TO REPEL INTRUDERS.
INTRUDERS. (BELL SECURITY!)

   BEFORE USING, THE CONTAINER SHOULD
BE GIVEN A PHEW SHAKES. UNDER LABORAT
ORY CONDITIONS ALL THE OIL IS EXTRACTED
FROM THE SEEDS. BUT WITH MY MICKEY
MOUSE METHOD A LOT OF OIL IS LEFT IN SO
THE RESIDUE IS QUITE POTENT. JUST BE
SURE YOU STRAIN OUT ANY LARGER BITS
SO THE SPRAYER HOLE IS NOT CLOGGED.

   THE GROUND SEEDS LEFT IN THE
PERCOLATOR ARE DRIED AND SAVED. THEY
ARE GREAT FOR THROWING INTO THE FACES
OF PEOPLE IN A MOB. IF YOU REALLY WANT
A LAUGH, THROW SOME BROADCAST FROM A
THEATER BALCONY DURING THE DEATH SCENE
IN "LOVE STORY".

   THE GOODY CALLED MACE IS PROBABLY
ONLY ACROLEIN. IF NOT, IT WORKS JUST
AS WELL AS MACE AND IS SIMPLE AND FUN
TO PRODUCE. IT IS THE SAME PRODUCT AS
DESCRIBED ON PAGES 104 THROUGH 106 OF
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK. MINE HOWEVER,
IS BROKEN DOWN AND SIMPLIFIED.

   ACROLEIN IS NOT TOXIC BUT CAUSES
HORRIBLE PAIN IN THE NOSE AND COPIOUS
TEARS, ANDB IRRITATES THE SKIN. A SHOT
IN THE FACE FROM A WATER PISTOL OR
SOME OTHER SPRAYER WILL PUT ANYONE OUT
OF THE GAME FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR.

   ACROLEIN IS BEST MADE ANB OUNCE AT
A TIME. PUT IN THE FLASK 2 1/2 OUNCES
OF GLYCERINE AND 3/4 OUNCE OF SODIUM
BISULFATE (SANI-FLUSH), BOTH OF WHICH
CAN BE BOUGHT AT ANY GROCERY STORE.

   THE STILL IS SET UP WITH THE OUTSIDE
TUBE CONNECTED AS THE FUMES ARE BAD.
WHEN THE MIXTURE STARTS TO BUBBLE IT
MUST BE WATCHED CONSTANTLY TO MAKE SURE
IT DOES NOT BUBBLE UP INTO THE NECK OF
THE FLASK. IF IT STARTS FOR THE NECK
OF THE FLASK, REMOVE THE LAMP UNTIL IT
SETTLES DOWN. IF THE LAMP IS TOO HOT,
THE TIN CAN IS RAISED ON SMALL BLOCKS
UNTIL THE RIGHT HEAT IS GOTTEN.

   DISTILL OFF AN OUNCE OF ACROLEIN
AND TAKE AWAY THE LAMP. AN OUNCE IS
ALL THIS SIZE BATCH IS GOOD FOR. LET
THE FLASK COOL FOR ANB HOUR BEFORE
OPENING AND CLEANING. POUR THE RESIDUE
DOWN THE SINK AND PUT YOUR FACE OVER
THE DRAIN TO GET A SAMPLE OF THE
VAPOR. THEN CAP THE RECEIVING BOTTLE
AND WASH EVERYTHING THE ACROLEIN WAS
IN CONTACT WITH. THE BEST SQUIRTER
FOR THE THREE IRRITANTS ABOVE IS A
WATER PISTOL. MOST WATER PISTOL. MOST
WATER PISTOLS LEAK BADLY SO THEY MUSTT
BE TRANBSPORTED BARREL UP SO THE GOODY
WON'T OOZE OUT AROUND THE TRIGGER. IT
WILL LEAK WHEN YOU USE IT SO IT IS
BEST TO PUT IN THE PLASTIC SANDWHICH
BAG WITH THE OPENING HELD AROUND THE
BARREL WITH THE RUBBERBAND. IF THE IS
PISTOL HAS A TRIGGER GUARD IT SHOULD BE
CUT OFF AND THEN IT CAN BE USED JUST AS
EASILY IN A PLASTIC BAG AS OTHERWISE.

   FOR CASUAL CARRYING AROUND, YOU CANT
BEAT A NASAL SPRAY. THE BEST ONES CAN
BE SCREWED OPEN SO THE GOODY CAN BE
POURED IN. IF NOT, YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE
IT AND PUT ITS NOZZLE INTO THE GOODY.
WHEN THE PRESSURE IS RELEASED THE
IRRITANT WILL BE SUCKED UP.

   SUCH IRRITANTS ARE ILLEGAL TO CARRY
IN SOME STATES. THAT'S ONE OF THE
REASONS THE NASAL SPRAY IS BEST. IF YOU
ARE SEARCHED AND IT IS FOUND, THERE
IS LITTLE CHANCE IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED
FOR WHAT IT IS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ADVICE TO GIVE YOU IF THE COP HAS THE
SNIFFLES AND GOES TO USE SOME OF YOUR
GOODY.

             THATS ALL PHOLKS

                       >>>>>> C02 Cartridge Bombs <<<<<<

     You will have to use up the new cartridge by either shooting it in a C02
B-B gun or use it in a C02 car or whatever else you might figure out to do
with it.  With a nail, force the hole bigger so as to allow the powder and
wick to fit in easily.  Fill the cartridte with black powder and pack it in
there real good by tapping the bottom of the cartridge on a hard surface.
Insert a fuse (I recommend good waterproof cannon fuse, but I've used fire-
cracker fuses.)  Light it and run!!!  It does wonders for a row of mail boxes.
Be careful however, this little beauty throws shrapnel and can be quite a
hazard.

                         >>>>>>Thermite Bombs<<<<<<

     The first step in the construction of a thermite bomb is to get some
iron-oxide (rust). Here is a good way to make large quantities in a short
time:  First you will need a DC converter which can be found on a race track
or train track.  Cut the connector off, separate the two wires, and strip them
both.  You will secondly need a jar of water which has been diluted with salt
to make the water a conductor (use about a tablespoon.)  Then insert both
wires into the solution and determine which bubbles the most.  You then need
to tie a common iron nail to the one that bubbles the most (The positive
wire).
If you don't you will get the opposite of rust...Rust acid!  Put the nail tied
to the positive wire and the negative wire in the jar on opposite sides until
they are both completely submerged.  Let that set over night and then remove
the
(crusty) stuff off the nail and remove the wires.  Let this set until a
sufficient amount of the crust is at the bottom.  Remove the excess water and
pour the crusty solution in a cookie sheet and let it dry out in the sun for a
couple of hours, or over night.  It should be an orange-brown color, though
I've
had it many different colors. Crush the rust into a fine powder and heat it in
a
cast iron pot until it's red. (I'm not sure what that does.)

     Now mix the iron-oxide with pure aluminum filings which can be bought or
filed down by hand from an aluminum tube or bar.  The ratio should be 8 grams
of
rust per 3 grams of aluminum. That's thermite!!!

     Now, to light it you must get some magnesium which is sorta hard to get
for me cause my hardware store don't have it.  I finally found that I could
get
a perfect piece of magnesium ribbon from the chemistry lab! This ribbon is the
fuse of the bomb.  It takes the heat from the burning magnesium to light the
thermite...But to light the magnesium you need a blow torch (Don't worry, the
blow torch is not hot enough to light the thermite).  Well keep your thermite
in
a bag and then when you see an innocent car...Pour a small amount of thermite
on
the wood, stick a length of magnesim in it and then light the magnesium with
the
blow torch and watch it burn right through the hood, the block, the axle, and
spark and flare on the pavement.  Be careful...The ideal mixtures can vaporize
carbonized steel (Which is damn hot!) Have fun!

                          >>>>>>Touch Explosive<<<<<<

     This is sort of a mild explosive, but can be dangerous in large
quantities.
To make touch explosive (Such as that found in a snap and pop, but more
potent)
mix iodine crystals into ammonia until the iodine crystals will not dissolve
into the ammonia anymore. Let it set until you get a white precipitate at the
bottom...Pour off the excess ammonia and dry out the crystals the same way as
the thermite.  Be careful now cause these dried crystals are your touch
explosives!  I haven't found a good use for it yet, but it's fun to throw at
people or leave it in their chairs at school..It can get painful if applied
properly!


                            >>>>>>Letter Bombs<<<<<<

     You will first have to make a mild version of thermite as mentioned
above, however you will use just plain iron filings instead of rust.  Mix the
iron filing with the aluminm filings in a ratio of 75% aluminum with 25% iron.
This mixture will burn violently in an enclosed space (such as an envelope)
which brings us to the next ingredient.  Go to the post office or business
supply store and buy an insulated (padded) envelope.  The type that is double
layered.  Separate the layers and place the mild thermite in the main section,
where the letter would go.  Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer.
There's your bomb. Now to light it!

     This is the tricky part and is hard to explain in writing. Experiment
with this idea until you have got it right.  Ok, the fuse is just that touch
explosive placed where the letter would be torn open. You may want to wrap it
like a long cigarette and then place it at the top of the envelope in the
outer
layer (on top of the powdered magnesium.)  When the touch explosive is torn or
even squeezed hard it will ignite the powdered magnesium (sort of a
flashlight)
and then it will burn the mild thermite. I've never sent one of these so I
don't
really know if it works good. I do know that the thermite burns real hot and
if
it didn't blow up it would give some one a bad burn (Thermite does wonders on
human flesh!!)

                            >>>>>>Paint Bombs<<<<<<

     To make a paint bomb you simply need a metal can with a fastenable lid,
a nice bright color paint, and a quantity of dry ice.  Place the paint in the
can and then drop the dry ice in.  Quickly place the lid on tightly and then
run.  With some testing you can get it down so you have a timer that works on
how much ice you have compared with how much paint you have.  If you're really
pissed at someone, you could place it on their doorstep, knock on the door,
and
then run!!!  Enough bombs....Let's work on cars.

                     >>>>>>Ways to Send A Car To Hell<<<<<<

     There are a thousand and one ways to destroy a car but I will only cover
those which are most fun and hardest to find out about.

     Place thermite on the hood as mentioned above, place burning magnesium on
the hood, tape a Co2 bomb to the (axle, hood, wheel, muffler, all), put a
tampon, dirt, sugar, a ping pong ball, just about anything) in the gas tank.
Put
(Potatoes, bananas, rocks, or anything at all that will fit) in the exhaust
pipe. Put a long rag in the gas tank and catch it on fire (Run real far). Make
a
jimmey and pick the lock and then steal the stereo....I'll try to draw a
picture...Cut one of those thin metal rulers int the pattern given below:

____________________________________________________    ____
                                                    |__|    \
sorta phallic huh?                                           |

The important part are the notches on the sides which are used to pull up ^ on
the cable which pulls up the lock!  Get stereos, equalizers, rader detectors,
car guns, loose change and cassette tapes, and then destroy the inside (a
knife
is handy for the seats.)

                           >>>>>>Hate school???<<<<<<

     One of my favorites for getting out of a class or two is to call in a
bomb
threat...Tell them it's in a locker, then they have to check them all and that
takes an hour at our school. I've even placed a fake bomb in a locker (not
mine), called it in, and they called off school for the whole week!! (Little
did I know that we had to make it up during the summer).  Or you could get
some pure potassium or pure sodium, put it in a capsule and flush it down a
toilet. Use a smoke grenade in the cafeteria, halls or bathrooms.  Steal keys
off the school computers, steal the 80col cards inside, or any of the cards!
Put a large magnet on the monitors.  Make friends with student assistants in
the
counseling office and have them change your grade when teachers hand in their
bubble sheets for the report cards.  Spit your gum out on the carpeted floor
at
school, and watch the janitors cry. Draw on lockers or write on the building
that the principal is a fascist. Ours offerereed a $100 reward after I did
that!!  I wanted to turn myself in!!  Use your imagination!


                      >>>>>>Phone Related Vandalism<<<<<<

     If you live where there are underground lines then you will be able to
ruin someone's phone line very easily.  All you must do is go to their house
and
find the green junction box that interfaces their line (and possibly some
others
in the neighborhood) with the major lines.  These can be found just about
anywhere but they are usually underneath the nearest phone pole. Take a socket
wrench and loosen the nut on the right. Then just take clippers or a sledge
hammer or a bomb and destroy the insides and pull up their phone cable.. Cut
it
into segments so it can't be fixed but must be replaced. There's a week of
work!!!  Or you can do my favorite, call them with a directory dialer for
about
a week...They won't get another call besides yours for that entire week!  How
about calling the phone company and having it disconnected for a while, or
have
their mail held for a month or two (Say you're going on vacation and give them
their address.)


                               >>>>>>Misc.<<<<<<

     How about going into Target and setting the alarms on the radios and
then crank the volume....Five minutes later.. while you are far away in
another part of the store....You hear radios cranked going off and people
frantically trying to turn it off..  Do some price switching, for yourself
or to get someone else in trouble.   Be creative.. There's always a way to be
obnoxious and annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     I would like to close by saying that Capt. Wuss should be black booked
for lying and generally making an asshole of himself......
