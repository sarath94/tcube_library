FIRE FUDGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.
     (1) This item consists of a mixture of sugar and potassium chlorate in a
         hot water solution which solidifies when cooled to room temperature.
         It can be used to ignite most incendiaries, except thermite. It may
         be used directly as an incendiary on rags, dry paper, dry hay, or in
         the combustible vapor above liquid fuels.
     (2) The igniter can be initiated by a fuse cord, string fuse, or concen-
         trated sulfuric acid.
     (3) Fire fudge resembles a white sugar fudge having a smooth, hard sur-
         face. The advantage of this igniter material over Sugar-Chlorate, is
         its moldability. The procedure for preparation must be followed
         closely to obtain a smooth, uniform material with a hard surface.
         CAUTION: THIS MATERIAL IS POISONOUS AND MUST NOT BE EATEN.
b. Material and Equipment.
     Granulated Sugar (NOT powdered or confectioners)
     Potassium chlorate (no coarser than the sugar)
     Metallic, glass, or enameled pan.
     Measuring container
     Spoon (non-metallic)
     Thermometer (200-250 degrees Fahrenheit)
c. Preparation.
     (1) Clean the pan by boiling some clean water in it for about five
         minutes. Discard the water, pour one measureful of clean water into
         the pan and warm it. Dry the measuring container and add one measure-
         full of sugar. Stir the liquid until the sugar dissolves.
     (2) Boil the solution until a fairly thick syrup is obtained.
     (3) Remove the pan from the source of heat to a distance of at least six
         feet and shut off the heat. Rapidly add two measurefuls of potassium
         chlorate. Stir gently for a minute to mix the syrup and powder, then
         pour or spoon the mixture into appropriate molds. If the mold is
         paper, it can usually be peeled off when the fire fudge cools and
         hardens. Pieces of cardboard or paper adhering to the igniter will
         not impair its use. Pyrex, glass, or ceramic molds can be used when a
         clear, smooth surface is desired. It is recommended that section
         thickness of molded fire fudge be at least one-half inch. If desired,
         molded fire fudge can be safely broken with the fingers.
         CAUTION: OF THIS IGNITER MATERIAL IS CARELESSLY HANDLED WITH
         EXCESSIVE BUMPING OR SCRAPING, IT COULD PRESENT ITSELF AS A HAZARD.
d. Application.
     (1) Place a piece of fire fudge on top of the incendiary. Minimum size
         should be about one inch square and one-half inch thick. Prepare the
         fire fudge for ignition with a fuse cord, string fuse, or
         concentrated sulfuric acid in the normal manner.
     (2) If only battery grade sulfuric acid is available, it must be concen-
         trated before use to a specific gravity of 1.835, by heading it in an
         enameled, heat resistant glass or porcelain pot, until dens, white
         fumes appear.
     (3) When used to ignite flammable liquids, wrap a quantity of the igniter
         mixture in a non-absorbent material and suspend it inside the
         container near the open top. The container must remain open for easy
         ignition and combustion of the flammable liquid.
     (4) To minimize the hazard of premature ignition of flammable liquid
         vapors, allow at least two feet of fuse to extend from the top edge
         of an open container of flammable liquid before lighting the fuse.


INCENDIARY BRICK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.
     (1) This incendiary is composed of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar,
         iron filings, and wax. When properly made, it looks like an ordinary
         building brick and can be easily transported without detection. The
         incendiary brick will ignite wooden walls, floors, and many other
         combustible materials.
     (2) This incendiary can be directly ignited by all igniters. To ignite
         this incendiary with White Phosphorus Solution, the solution must
         first be poured on absorbent paper and the paper placed on top of the
         brick.
b. Material and Equipment.
                                                         Parts By Volume
  Potassium chlorate (powdered)..........................      40
  Sulfur (powdered)......................................      15
  Granulated sugar.......................................      20
  Iron filings...........................................      10
  Wax (beeswax or candle wax)............................      15
  Spoon or stick
  Brick mild
  Red paint
  Measuring cup or can
  Double boiler
  Heat source (hot plate or stove)

c. Preparation.
     (1) Fill the bottom half of the double boiler with water and bring to a
         boil.
     (2) Place the upper half of the boiler on the lower portion and add the
         wax, sulfur, granulated sugar, and iron filings in the proper amount.
     (3) Stir well to blend all the materials evenly.
     (4) Remove the upper half of the double boiler from the lower portion and
         either shut off the heat source or move the upper section several
         feet from the fire.
         CAUTION: EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE
         ACCIDENTAL IGNITION OF THE MIXTURE IS POSSIBLE. SOME MEANS OF
         EXTINGUISHING A FIRE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP
         FACE, HANDS, AND CLOTHING AT A REASONABLY SAFE DISTANCE DURING THE
         REMAINDER OF THE PREPARATION. A FACE SHIELD AND FIREPROOF GLOVES ARE
         RECOMMENDED.
     (5) CAREFULLY add the required amount of potassium chlorate and again
         stir well to obtain a homogeneous mixture.
     (6) Pour the mixture into a brick mold and set aside until it cools and
         hardens.
     (7) When hard, remove the incendiary from the mold, and paint it red to
         simulate a normal building brick.
d. Application.
     (1) When painted, the incendiary brick can be carried with normal
         construction materials and placed in or on combustible materials.
     (2) A short time delay in ignition can be obtained by combining fuses
         and one of the igniters.


PETN - Pentaerythrite Tetranitrate - (penta, niperyth, penthrit)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PETN  is  a  high  explosive  used  in  detonating that is one of the most 
powerful  military explosives, almost equal in force to nitroglycerine and RDX. 
When  used  in  a  detonating cord, it has a detonation velocity of 21,000 feet 
per  second  and  is relatively insensitive to friction and shock from handling 
and transportation.
     PREPARATION:  Four  hundred  cc.  of  strong white nitric acid-prepared by 
adding  a  little  urea  to  fuming  nitric  acid, warming, and blowing dry air 
through  it until it is completely decolorized-is cooled in a 600 cc. beaker in 
a  freezing  mixture  of  ice  and  salt.  One hundred grams of pentaerythrite, 
ground  to  pass  a 50-mesh sieve, is added to the acid a little at a time with 
efficient  stirring  while  the  temperature is kept below 5 degrees. After all 
has  been added, the stirring and the cooling are continued for 15 minutes. The 
mixture  is  then drowned in about 4 liters of cracked ice and water. The crude 
product,  amounting  to  about 221 grams or 95% of the theory, is filtered off, 
washed  free  from  acid,  digested for an hour with a liter of hot 0.5% sodium 
carbonate   solution,  again  filtered  off  and  washed,  dried,  and  finally 
recrystallized  from  acetone. A good commercial sample of PETN melts at 138.0-
138.5  degrees. The pure material melts at 140.5-141.0 degrees, short prismatic 
needles, insoluble in water, difficultly soluble in alcohol and ether.


RDX - Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine - (Cyclonite, Hexagon, T4)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     RDX  is  a  white  crystalline  solid  that  exhibits very high shattering 
power.  It  is  commonly  used  as  a  booster in explosive trains or as a main 
bursting  charge.  It  is  stable  in  storage,  and  when combined with proper 
additives,  may  be  cast or press loaded. It may be initiated by lead azide or 
mercury fulminate.
     PREPARATION:  Detailed  instructions  are not available on the preperation 
of  this  product at this time, but if you are a good chemist, you will be able 
to  make  it  from  the brief description following- Cyclonite, prepared by the 
nitration  of  hexamethylenetetramine  (C6H12N4), is derived ultimately from no 
other  raw  materials  than  coke,  air,  and water. Hexamethylenetetramine has 
basic  properties and forms a nitrate (C6H12N4-2HNO3, m.p. 165 degrees) that is 
soluble  in  water,  insoluble  in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and acetone. The 
product  C3H6O6N6,  prepared  by  nitrating  this nitrate is cyclonite. Another 
method  of  extracting  RDX is by treating hexamethylenetetramine directly with 
strong  nitric  acid.  In  the  acid  process, the tetramine is added slowly in 
small  portions  at a time to nitric acid (1.52 s.g.) at a temperature of 20-20 
degrees.  When  all  the  tetramine  and  acid are mixed, warm the liquid to 55 
degrees.  The allow the mixture to stand for a few minutes, allowing it to cool 
to  20  degrees,  and  the  product  will  be precipitated with the addition of 
water.  One  example  is  50  grams  of the hexamethylenetetramine added to 550 
grams  of  100%  nitric  acid  at  30 degrees, over a period of 15 minutes; the 
mixture  was  cooled  to  0  degrees, held at 0 degrees for 20 minutes, and the 
drowned  with  water.  A chemical diagram of the chemicals and the reaction are 
shown below.

Hexamethylenetetramine                                                      


COMPOSITION B
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Composition  B  is  a high-explosive mixture with a relative effectiveness 
higher  than that of TNT. It is also more sensitive than TNT. It is composed of 
RDX  (59%),  TNT  (40%), and wax (1%). Because of its shattering power and high 
rate  of detonation, Composition B is used as the main charge in certain models 
of bangalore torpedoes and shaped charges.


COMPOSITION C4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Composition  C4 is the most common military plastic explosive. It is often 
referred  to as C4 Plasique. C4 is a white plastic high-explosive more powerful 
than  TNT.  It  consists  of  91% RDX and 9% plastic binder. It remains plastic 
over  a  wide  range  of  temperatures  (-70 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit), and is 
about  as  sensitive  as  TNT.  It is eroded less than other plastic explosives 
when  immersed  under  water  for  long periods. Because of its high detonation 
velocity  and  its  plasticity,  C4 is well suited for gutting steel and timber 
and for breaching concrete.


PENTOLITE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Pentolite  is  a  high  explosive mixture of equal proportions of PETN and 
TNT.  It  is  light yellow and is used as the main bursting charge in grenades, 
small  shells,  and  shaped  charges.  Pentolite  may be melted and cast in the 
container.  Pentolite  should not be drilled to produce cavities, forming tools 
should be used.


Well,  that  is  about  it...  Hope  you have a good one... and as for the next 
volume  of  ANE,  I  don't know... I write it whenever I feel like it, whenever 
I'm in a boring mood, whatever... Till then, later- DD
