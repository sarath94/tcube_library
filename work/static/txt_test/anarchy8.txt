MISC FORMULAS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Use caution when mixing these formulas. I got these from an anonymous
source, so I haven't tested or know the correct ammounts for mixing or what
each chemical's property is. Otherwise, I would suppose each mixture is
either approximately 50/50 each ingredient, or something like 90/10, 10/90
for each ingredient, percentilewise.

Nitric acid & resin
Barium nitrate & magnesium
Ammounium nitrate & powdered aluminum
Barium peroxide & zinc dust
Ammonium perchlorate & asphaltum
Sodium chlorate & shellac gum
Potassium nitrate & charcol
Sodium peroxide & sulfur flowers
Magnesium percholate & wood meal
Potassium percholate & cane sugar
Sodium nitrate & sulfur flour
Potassium bichromate & antimony sulfide
Guanidine nitrate & powdered antimony
Potassium chlorate & red phosphorus
Potassium permanganate & powdered sugar
Barium chlorate & paraffin wax


HOME-MADE POTASSIUM CHLORATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Materials:
 1 Gallon Houshold Bleach
63 Grams Potassium Chloride
   Distilled Water
   Heat Source
   Hydrometer

Procedure: Take one gallon of bleach and place it in the container and begin
heating. While heating, weigh out 63 grams of Potassium Chloride and add this to
the bleach being heated. Bring this solution to a boil and continue until a
hydrometer reads 1.3, or with a battery hydrometer, Full. When this is
complete, take the solution and allow it to cool in a controlled environment
(a refrigerator) until the temperature of the mixture is between 0-25 degrees
Celsius. Filter out precipitate crystals and save them. Re-boil the remaining
solution and cool as previously. Filter and save the crystals. Then, take all
of the crystals and mix them with distilled water in the proportion of
56 grams per 100 milliliteres of distilled water. Heat this solution to
boiling and allow to cool. Filter the solution and save the precipitate
crystals. These crystals are Potassium Chlorate of relative purity. Powder the
crystals to a fine mist, and heat gently to evaporate any remaining moisture.


HOME-MADE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Materials:
    Potassium Chlorate
    White Gasoline (Camp Stove Fuel)
    Wax (Beeswax or Candle Wax)
    Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline)

Procedure: Melt five parts vaseline and five parts wax. Dissolve this in
White Gasoline, and pour this liquid on 9 parts Potassium Chlorate. In a
plastic bowl, knead this liquid into the Potassium Chlorate until intimately
mixed. Allow all of the gas to evaporate and place the explosive in a cool,
dry place. Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorus compounds. This
explosive is best when molded into the desired shape with a density of 1.3
grams, and dipped in wax to waterproof. These charges guarantee the highest
detonation velocity.


DRANO BOMB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This one is easy and quick.

Materials:
    Liquid Drano, or Chlorine Bleach
    Gasoline
    Glass or ceramic jar

Procedure: Take the gas and pour it into the jar to about 3/4 full. Take the
Drano and pour it into the gas close to the top of the jar. Run Like HELL!


IODINE BOMB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Materials:
    Ammonia
    Solid Iodine
    Glass or ceramic bowl

Procedure: Place the iodine in bowl. Pour the ammonia into the  bowl to cover
the iodine and some excess to assure an excess of ammonia. Allow the mixture
to mix naturally. When the iodine and ammonia has mixed, pour the remaining
liquid off of the top and scoop the paste remaining on the bottom of the bowl.
Mold the paste into the form you want it to be in when it dries. When dry, the
material is very shock/friction sensitive, and to detonate, throw/kick/etc
and watch!


GAS BOMB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Materials:
   Potassium Permanganate
   Gasoline
   Glass or ceramic jar

Procedure: Take the jar and pour enough gasoline into the jar to coat the
inside completely. Place 2-4 drops of Potassium Permanganate in the jar,
close, and throw violently to detonate.


MATCH HEAD BOMBS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Materials:
   Match Heads
   Black Powder
   Bowl or open container
   Container

Procedure: Fill the specified container full of match heads, and compress the
match heads as much as possible. Remove the match heads and place them in a
bowl. Pour some black powder, enough to cover the match heads lightly with
powder, and mix completely. Pour the match/powder mixture into the container.
Compress the mixture into the jar, and if there is more room, fill the
remainder with compressed black powder. Cover the container and place fuse
in the container for easy lighting. Light, and run away....
