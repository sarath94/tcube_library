     HOW TO 'FUCKIN' PARTY
         BY THE BLADE

  A Pipeline (ST) Presentation
         (805)-526-5660

 Ok all you computer geeks, get off your fucking ass and do something
REALLY fun, unlike calling K()()L BBS's and AE's all day.  There are
many definitions of the word 'Party' today.

  Some suggested meanings might be 'to go to a large meeting of people,
to eat, drink, and be merry' or 'to go into the woods or someplace
away from authority and some a bone (any drugs), or   'To get FUCKIN
totally wasted and go fuckin crazy'.  Well, the 3'rd definition fits me
the best, and heres a short summary of whats REAL party is to me. Its
around 7:30, I take a shower, get dressed, and get picked up (I never 
drive because then you can't get as wasted as you want), and go to the
place of party.  My freinds (say 4 or 5) have 3 cases of Miller, .5g
of doobage, and a 20 pack of trojans (rubbers for you virgins).  We get
to the party, are welcomed, and start pounding or playing quaters, give
beer to the girls you want to take advantage of later in the evening,

More (Y/N/NS): 

and have a good time.
  Later in the evening, you are wasted, getting laid, and obviously, 
having a good time.  Simple as that. Ok, alot of you geeks don't know
one kind of beer from another. Here's a little chart of whats the good,
the bad, and the expensive.

       GOOD            BAD        WORTH THE $      NOT WORTH THE $
    
       ----            ---        -----------      ---------------
       MILLER      Mister Brau    Harp ($28case)   Hineykin(overated)
       Bud(ok)     Black Label    Molsen Golden    Strohs

    Coors(west)  Old Milwalkee     Michelob         Grizzly(way overated)
      Busch(low$)  Steg lite/dark   Moosehead      Lowenbrau (Shit!)

  Just to give you an idea of what to get, if you can get it.
 HOW TO GET IT-------------An age old problem for the youth.


  In your everyday town, it's next to impossible, cause the old douche
bag knows your under 21 (or whatever the drinking age may be).  The
most common way, that I do, is go into the city (New York) or send away

More (Y/N/NS): 

and get a fake I.D. that says you are no more than 22.  If possible get
a fake drivers license and a college I.D., and make sure they have a
picture of yourself on them (Errr!), because more and more places want
photo I.D.'s. If you don't have the guts to go in the liquor store and
get it yourself, get someone over 21 to get it for you, offer them like
+$2 per item you get, cause they can get in deep shit for doin it.                              
Or, another oldie but goodie, go out front and 'bum' a buyer, this is
some what dangerous, because if you ask the wrong person, they'll call
the pigs on you and it would be beat. Now that you got the shit, you got
to find a place to party.  Below are some 'cool' and 'beat' places to
party.           
                   Cool                           Beat
                  ------                         ------
          The Beach (at night)           The Beach (in daylight)
          Barns not in use (moded)       Farmer's fields (they shoot!)                   Losers houses (DESTROY!!!)     Quaterback's houses (can't do shit)
          Your backyard (in control)     Empty houses (get busted!)

Anywhere that is safe from the cops and concered parents is a cool place
to party, but remember if it's around where you live (and if you have
a recordlike some people) keep it casual, cause the pigs will come right
to you if there is any damage at the sight. I forgot a major part of
REAL partying, Hard Liquor!.  The best hard shit I've done is Bacardi

More (Y/N/NS): 

151 proof rum, the shit floors you, if you are in a real shit kickin
mood, then this stuff is for you.  If you don't want to pass out, 
(passing out is NOT my idea of partying, unless if it's 'Puke or Pass
out' quarters), try the regulars, such as whisky, burbon, vermouth,
to-keel-a, scotch, kuhlua, snapps (peppermint, strawberry, root beer, to
name a few), and many other can make an enjoyable evening. 
 
  My personal favorite of 'hard liquors' is vodka.  A half a bottle of
Absolut (which IS the best vodka) gets ya flyin, you don't care what
you say, nor care what you do, this is the also the favorite of pussy,

I mean girls,around here (no thanks to me).  Or if you want to have a
trip, drink 1/3 a bottle of Absolut, and then 3 or 4 beers, preferably
mixed, and you will have one fucked night, you feel like you are a La-
Machine, try it, you see.

Getting pussy-------------

Ok, rule #1, don't make a fool out of yourself, yes, you are drunk, but
still don't go up to the bitch and say "wanna fuck?", either she will
slap you, or tell you to fuck off.  You gotta wait till the evening is

More (Y/N/NS): 

goin, when everybody's loose, and havin a good time.  Spot your piece
of meat, then look her up, and look her down, and see if it's for you,
which anything looks good when your fucked up, and walk over to her and
and ask her (nicely) for a beer or a cigarette, or vice versa, offer it
to her.  This usally gets conversation going, and eventually leads up to
bedroom, or what have you.   At one party I went to, there was this
totally fucked up chick, who was hanging all over everyone, (she wasn't  
bad), also she was on the verge of passing out.  So my freinds and I got
together and starting thinking of what we could do, (sex-you-all).

  We got a molson golden bottle,put some vaseleene on it (to be nice),
and took off her pants (in front of like 50 people) and started fucking
her with the molson bottle, she fuckin took it half-way! (which is a
fucking lot), the funny thing about it, she enjoyed every second of it,
 shit, I'll never forget that. 

House Partying--------------
In my opinion, house parties are the best.  You've got a roof over
you rhead, and diffrent rooms to fuck around in.  When people have house
parties,it's usally the only one they are going to have, cause after a
party, there's spilled beer, puke, cigarette burns all over, holes in

More (Y/N/NS): 

the walls, things stolen, food eaten, and it's just a fuckin mess.
  But who gives a shit if it's not your house, if the kid's a loser,
then fucking do all the above!, you're not gonna get busted, HE is. Get
there early, and case the place, find out where the liquor cabinet, tape
& record collection, VCR,T.V., jewelry, and where other valuables are.
Then when the party crew gets there, the owner of the house can't keep
his eyes on 100 people at once, so start destroying and stealing every 
thing. Knock holes in the walls, shove screwdrivers into the VCR's and
TV's, get on the roof and pour gasoline down the chimney, if ya do it
right it will blow at the base of the chimney, and suit (that black
shit) will blow all over the house...  Go to the garage and strip the
car, radar dectors, stereo's, and leather seats can get a good price on
the black market, so can the whole car if you can get it out without
totaling it.  Go to the kitchen and dump all their food into shopping
bags,bring it to your local homeless people place and say 'ill give you
all this food for 15 bucks' when it's obviously worth around 50.  Well I
sorta gotoff the track, but I hope this gave you some sort of idea so
you can go out and party.  I'll leave you with one final note-
Liquor before beer, you're in the clear Beer before liquor, you're never
SICKER  (you'll puke that is)...

Disclaimer:  You are your own person, if you kill yourself on Bacardi
 151, thats you're own fuckin fault, if you can't handle it, don't do it.

A bomb made from Drano.. Brought to you by The Pipeline (ST)


Ingredients:

1. Glass or plastic coke bottle.
2. 1 can of CRYSTAL draino, NOT LIQUID DRANO!
3. Some aluminum foil.
4. A cup of water.

Prepartion:                                        
 (Make sure the bottle has a cap!).
Fill the bottle 1 fourth to 1 thirds of the way with CRYSTAL draino.
Get the aluminum foil and make about 7-10 balls of it that will fit
into the bottle, then put them into the bottle...
    Now, get the cup of water and pour it into the bottle. After this
is done, quickly screw the cap on as tight as possible. Now shake
the bottle, throw it, or whatever, just so the contents get mixed
together. What will happen is it will get so hot in the bottle that it
will have to blow up... With a plastic bottle you have about 15 seconds
before detonation, with a glass bottle you have anywhere from 30 seconds

  [___How to make a Letterbomb___]
 [___Found on The Pipeline (ST)___]

  Letter bombs are very simple to make, but the difficult part is making
sure ti will detonate properly. You must also make it disguisable as not
being a bomb.
       
 [___Mixtures___]
  About 75% alluminum powder with 25% iron powder is best. This is a
light version of thermite, and since it is in an enclosed space it will
work quite well. The idea is that Iron can burn at high temps, but it
needs a little help (the aluminum)  Magnesium is used to ignite the
aluminum, which ignites the Iron.  Since it is burning in an enclosed
space, it ill burn hotter and slower than the normal mix.

  I advise you to play with the mixture for a while to get the optimum
one.
    Now for the fun stuff:
Get an insulated (hopefully with a canceled Postage stamp) envelope, the
type that is double layered. Seperate the layers. In the inner one goes
the wonderful mixtur. Keep this section seperate, but it might be nice to

More (Y/N/NS): 

top it off with some magnesium. The outer layer can be either magnesium
(for flash bomb effect) or something else. Now the difficult part, The
fuse.

We make the fuse from iodine crystals, and ammonium Hydroxide crystals.
(liquid).  Mix these together in about an equal amount. (you may want to
add more crystals to form a new crystalline structure.  About one inch
long. These  crystals are highly  volatile and I advise  keeping them
protected.  They have the  impact power of 1 M-100  firecracker per
teaspoon.  I put them in a  prescription bottl e(with  cotton lining). 
Spread these while wet on the label of the envelope and put them so that
pressure is applied if the package is opened. But not from just squeezing
it.(thats the tricky part).  Glue it up and you have a working one, then
just deliver it to where you want it to blow up(the reason for the
postmarked stamp).  They rarely make it past the post office since they
are easily recognized.

I dont recommend using these for revenge because you never know who is
going to be around when it goes off, or that it even will go off. There
are better ways so use one of them.  Also, it is a federal crime to make
or send them.  Procede at your own risk and remember.  'It is a crime to

More (Y/N/NS): 

rob a bank, not to know how to rob it'.

        Light Bulb Bomb 
Written By: The Phantom Phreaker

How to make a wicked-ass bomb in 8 simple steps.

Materials needed:

A small file.
A small funnel or medicine dropper
A small pourable container of gasoline
Slyness and lots of stealth.

Step 1: Break into a someone's house. this is not completely necessary,
but I  don't think one would want to do it to one's own house...

Step 2: Locate the most used room. This is very easy, just look for a
mess, bottles and shit lying around, the tv in the room, worn carpeting.


More (Y/N/NS): 

Step 3: Locate a room with a light bulb pretty close to the light switch,
for maximum effect.

Step 4: Unscrew the light bulb, hold the bulb in exactly the way you took
it out of the socket. Now take a file and file away a small section of
the glass near the metal section of the bulb.

Step 5: After you have a small hole, insert either a small funnel or a
medicine dropper into the hole, fill the bulb with gasoline so that the
filament is running through the gas.

Step 6: Put the bulb back in the socket without spilling any of the
contets. You might want to turn the bulb to get the hole on the other
side of the viewers plane of vision, when turning on the lights.

Step 7: Get your ass out of their house before they wake up or co
me home.

Step 8: When they come home, whoever turns the lights on is going to get
a hell of a suprise!!!

Part I-What's it all about?

Youve all had someone you would like to get revenge on.  Heres youre
chance. The methods below are some of the best to use.

Part II-Porno's etc.

If the person you know is a kid, here is a neat trick.  Take those
subscription cards from Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, etc. Fill it out
with the persons name, address etc. Also, try having sexual aids catalogs
sent to the person. Oh yes, use the 'BILL ME LATER'option. Some
company's send trial condoms (yes,they do). Go hed, try it!


Part III-Getting busted

This I have used many times.  It usually only works with people whose
parents work in the day.  While at a store, GET BUSTED FOR BEING ROWDY

More (Y/N/NS): 

,LOUD AND, OBNOXIOUS ect...They will ask youre name: Give them the
persons name, ph # etc. This works very well, but be careful.

Part IV-School tricks

These are all tricks that can be used school:

1-Plant Oregano (or Real weed) White powder (or Real Coke <-I doubt that)
or a bottle of pills saying 'SPEED' or 'Ludes' or whatever in the persons
locker. You need to find their combo. Juststand next to them while they
open their locker.  Then leave a note to the principal or call him/her
saying that you saw this kid with drugs and you want to remain anonymous.
They check the kids locker out and -BINGO!-guess what they find!

2-My personal favorite:Impersonating a teacher.  This can be done by
calling home as a teacher saying he was truant, or his 'conduct' was bad.
Use a REAL teachers name, and a good voice, obviously!  Or get a slip
that is a Warning Card (or a deficiency notice, etc.) and fill it out as
a teacher. Send it home (look up his address in a phone book) and say
that his homework was not being done or he was cheating on a test.


More (Y/N/NS): 

Part VI- Mail order, pt. II

Get a Boys Life magazine. On the back they usually have an ad for
'Captain O Greeting Cards'. This is the Co. that has you sells cards for
them. You have to sell at least 12 boxes to get out! Sign 'em up! Also,
order those 11 tapes from the Columbia Record and Tape Club.  Sign them
up for the 11 tapes.  They **HAVE** to buy 8 of them to get out of the
deal at about $1O a crack. Order anything & everything!

Part VII-Fun fun fun!

Try this.  Plant FLEA eggs (you can find 'em at a vets office. Tell 'em
it's for a science project) in their rugs, clothes, furniture, etc.This
is living hell for them. Also try putting a fake mouse in the fridge, or
a live toad/frog.  

Part VIII-Misc. ways

1-Card stuff to their house.
2-Prank calls (boooring).
3-Bomb there house with fireworks.

More (Y/N/NS): 

4-Blow their tires but putting nails behind them in the drive way.
5-Good ol' Cosmos. Get rid of their line.
6-TRW-Good for getting their cards.
7-Put what LOOKS like a bomb in their mailbox (Ed. Note:This works
awesome!)
Oh well, until part II...

         HOW TO MAKE M-80's
__________________________________

 This file deals with how to make M-80's or similair type small explosive
charges that make LOUD noises.

   The hardest part with making M-80's is the powder. The kind of powder
that you want is the silver type used in firecrackers.  It is made of
Potassium Perchlorate KCIO , Aluminium & Sulfur. You can take apart
                          4
firecrackers...or, you can make it out of the above ingredients. Get each
of these in as fine of powder as you can.  Obtain a postage or any small
scale and mix them BY WEIGHT in the folloing ratios.

1 pt.  - Powdered sulfur
1 pt.  - Powdered Aluminium
2 pts. - Potassium Perchlorate KCIO
                                   4 

More (Y/N/NS): 


DO NOT use potassium chlorate, it will explode violently when mixed with
sulfur.  Stir the powder well with a piece of wood in a plastic bowl.
Next, you will need some thing to contain the powder in. Get some thick
cardboard tubing with a diameter of 1/2 to 3/4"  You can find tubing
anywhere. I have found a gold mine where I work, I just grab the
Cardboard tubes register receipt tape is wrapped around. The thicker the
sides of the tube are, the better. The actual M-80 I have.(Not Home Made)
is 1 1/2" long and hasa diameter of 1/2".

   Third, you will need fuse, where I live, a sporting goods store sells
it under the name to cannon fuse for 15 cents a foot, but it really
should be  Waterproof fuse.  You can pull it  out of any  number of
fireworks.

  If you have gotten all that, now you need end-plugs. I personally use
one of  those hot melt  glue guns.  Works great.  You can  use Elmers
Glue-All but it takes a long time to dry.  Or, you can get a piece of
wood dowel that telescopes into your tube, cut 1/4" thick discs and
smear Elmer's on them.


More (Y/N/NS): 

To Assemble:

  Put in one endplug, with whatever method you are using, let it dry,
harden or whatever it has to do. Drill your fuse hole in the center of
the tube.  Put in the fuse and pour the powder in.  Put in the other
endplug. Glue or whatever and Viola, a M-80.  Don't worry about pouring
hot glue on the powder mixture, it won't ignite.
  I have never had a homemade M-80 I wasn't proud of. The powder mixture
detailed above has some astonishing capabillity. Use the above well, and
try not to hurt ur self.

[_FIREBOMBS_:Most firebombs are simply gasoline filled bottles with a
oil soaked rag in the mouth.  The original Molotov Cocktail was one part
gasoline and one part motor oil.  The Oil makes it splatter and stick on
what your trying to burn.  Some use one part roofing tar or 1 part
melted wax to 2 parts gasoline.

[_NAPALM___: About the best fire bomb is Napalm.  It has a thick
consistancy like jam and is best for use on vehicles or buildings.
Napalm is simply one part gas and one part soap.  The soap can be Ivory
flakes or shredded bar soap.  Detergents are out and the gas must be
heated in order for the soap to melt.  The usual way is with a double 
boiler where the top part has at least a two quart capacity.  Water in
the bottom part is brought to a boil and taken from the stove and
carried to where there is no flame.  Then put the gasoline filled one
over the hot water(repeat until the soap melts.(stir it well))

[_MATCHHEAD BOMB_: Simple saftey match heads in a pipe, capped at both
ends, can make a devistating bomb.  It is set off with a regular fuse.
Put a baggie in first to prevent detonation by contact with the metal.
Cutting enough match heads to fill the pipe can be tedious work but get
a few friends to help ya.  If you steal a paper cutter from school, you
can cut a book at a time.

[_HTH Smoke Bomb_:  Using HTH pooLclorine (2 parts) and Non silicone
brake fluid (3 parts) makes one hell of a smoke bomb.  When you add
these two together, it gives off really thick smoke.

These projects are for those of you who would like to get even at
somebody but you don't realy want to hurt them. Just scare the hell out
 of em.

----------[=IODINE CRYSTALS=]----------
 These little beauties are pressure sensitive so that the slightest
touch will cause a fairly loud explosion. (About a fourth of a fire
cracker per crystal) It may not seem like much, but there are usally
about 500 crystals in a teaspoon of crystalized iodine. Also, when the
first one goes off, it will most likely start a chain reaction and
cause all of the others around it to go off too, which would cause all
of the others around each one of those to go off ect...

Materials:


More (Y/N/NS): 

1.  1 bottle of iodine crystals.
2.  1 bottle of ammonia nitrate

Instructions:                  
Mix 2 teaspoons of crytals with about 4 ounces of ammonia. You might have
to expirement with the measurements a little bit to see what works best.
Stir until dissoled, then pour it over the area that you want to trap.
Let the ammonia evaporate so all that will be left are the tiny crystals.
(they are almost invisible) Then, when somebody steps on or sets 
something down on it...

THIS TUTORIAL WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO "PICK" A PIN TUMBLER LOCK.  USE
OF THIS MATERIAL IS FOR LOCKSMITHS ONLY, ANYUSE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR
ILLEGAL PURPOSES IS FORBIDDEN AND AGAINST THE LAW. (AS LONG AS WE ARE
AT IT, DO YOU WANT TO BUY SOME LAND IN FLORIDA?) IN ORDER TO PICK A PIN 
TUMBLER LOCK, YOU WILL REQUIRE FOUR ITEMS: A LOCK, YOU, A PICK, AND A
TENSION WRENCH. YOU CAN USSUALLY GET THESE AT A LOCKSMITH STORE, IF YOU 
CAN NOT FIND ONE NEAR YOU THERE WILL BE AN ADDRESS AT THE END OF THE
ARTICLE THAT YOU CAN ORDER THEM FROM. HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF A PICK
AND A TENSION WRENCH:

      PICK         TENSION WRENCH

 MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THE NEED FOR THE PICK, BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE
WRENCH IS FOR.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WITH-OUT IT IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK A LOCK. IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK, WE MUST COUNT UPON
THE IMPERFECTION OF THE LOCK. BEFORE WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACTUALLY PICK THE
LOCK, WE WILL LOOK AT THE PARTS OF IT AND HOW THE IMPERFECTION PART FITS
IN.  HERE IS A DISSASSEMBLED LOCK:

    \__/-------------------  <- KEY

WHEN YOU INSERT A KEY INTO A LOCK, THE BOTTEM PINS ARE PUSHED UP, AND
IF IT IS THE PROPER KEY, THE TOPS OF THE BOTTOM PINS WILL MATCH WITH
THE SPOT WHERE THE PLUG AND HOUSING MEET, THUS ALLOWING YOU TO TURN THE
PLUG, AND OPEN THE DOOR, ETC.. WHEN YOU INSER THE KEY, THE BOTTOM PINS
GO INTO THE VALLEYS OF THE KEY, THUS MEANING THAT THE KEY MUST HAVE THE
RIGHT HEIGHT VALLEYS TO MAKE THE LOCK OPEN. PRETTY ELEMENTRY, RIGHT?
WELL NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO HOW TO PICK A LOCK. IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK
WE (AS I SAIDBEFORE) DEPEND ON THE INACCURACY OF THE MANUFACTURING
PROCESS. THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO INSERT THE TENSION WRENCH INTO THE
LOCK AND APPLY A SLIGHT PRESSURE TO THE LEFT (OR RIGHT IF YOU WISH) SO
THAT IF YOU COULD LOOK INSIDE THE LOCK AT WHERE THE PLUG AND THE HOUSING
WOULD MEET, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS>

               ! !*! !
     HOUSING   ! !*! !
               ! !*! !
     ----------! !*! !-----------
     ----------  !*! ------------

More (Y/N/NS): 

              !  !*!!
     PLUG     !  !_!!
              !   _ !
              !  !*!!
              !  \_/!

NOW A SLIGHT PRESURE IS ON THE PINS. BECAUSE THE PINS CAN NOT BE PRODUCED
EXACTLY THE SAME, THERE IS ONE PIN WHICH IS THE WIDEST AND THERE FORE HAS
MORE TENSION ON IT, AND ONE WHICH IS THE THINNEST AND HAS ALMOST NO
PRESSURE ON IT. WE NOW USE THE PICK TO >GENTLY< PUSH EACH PIN UP (AND TRY
TO FEEL IT WHEN YOU LET IT DOWN) UNTIL WE FIND WHICH IS THE TIGHTEST ON
AND WHICH IS LOOSEST. GETTING THE FEEL FOR THIS IS THE HARDEST PART OF
LOCK PICKING. NOW THAT YOU HAVE FOUND THE LOOSEST ONE, GENTLY PRESS IT
UPWARD UNTIL YOU FEEL A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN TENSION ON THE TENSION
WRENCH. THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM PIN BECOMES EVEN
WITH THE JUNCTION OF THE PLUG AND THE HOUSING. DO NOT RELEASE ANY TENSION
FROM THE WRENCH NOW! THE DRIVER WILL NOW BE TRAPPED IN THE HOUSING AS
ILLUSTRATED HERE: (DON'T I DRAW PRETTY)

            ! !*! !
   HOUSING  ! !*! !

               ! \_/ !
               !     !

NOW YOU CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WITH EACH OF THE PINS UNTIL YOU WORK YOUR
WAY UP TO THE ONE THAT IS WIDEST. WITH SOME PRACTICE YOU CAN GET FAIRLY
FAST AT THIS. I SUGGEST PRACTICING ON A FOUR PIN TUMBLER LOCK THAT IS
BOUGHT FROM A HARDWARE STORE, THE CHEAPER THE BETTER. I WOULD LIKE TO
DISCUSS A PATICULAR CONFIGURATION OF THE PINS NOW THAT MAY PRESENT A
PARTICULARLY HARD JOB TO PICK. THIS IS GRAPHICLY SHOWN HERE BY THE TWO
MIDDLE PINS:

  
      !*! !*! !*! !*!
        !*! !*! !_! !*!
        !*! !*!  _  !*!

        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/

             \---------------

WHEN YOU TRY TO PUSH THE 2ND PIN FROM THE LEFT UP, YOU WILL UNAVOIDABLE
BE PUSHING THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT UP BECAUSE OF IT'S LONG BOTTOM PIN.
THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR THIS IS TO GET A SPECIAL PICK THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:
         \
          \   ---------------
           \_/

THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT IT IS HARD TO INITIALLY DETECT. THE
REASON THAT IT MAKES IT HARDER IF IT IS NOT IMMEDIETLY APPERANT IS THAT
YOU UNAVOIDABLY PUSH THE 3RD PIN FROM THE LEFT UP INTO THE HOUSING,
GETTING IT JAMMED:

              !!*!!   
     PLUG     !!*!!

I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A TECHNIQUE CALLED RAKING. IT USES A TOOL
LIKE THIS:

        \/\/\/\-----------

BASICLY YOU "RAKE" IT BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE PINS, HOPING THAT
COMBINED WITH THE TENSION IT WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT COMBINATION. THIS
WAY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO WORK FAST SOMETIMES, BUT IS NOT VERY RELIABLE, AND
I WOULD SUGGEST LEARNING TO ACTUALLY "PICK" THE LOCK. EARLIER I PROMISED

          THE DISK DRIVE BOMB
          ===================

INGREDENTS:
-----------
MATCHES
FINGER NAIL POLISH REMOVER
FLOPPY DISK
RAZOR BLADE

  First, take a regular drinking glass  and poor a small amount of nail
polish remover in it. Scrape off the friction reacted tip of the match
into the glass keep adding the tips of the matches and stirring until a
muddy like mixture forms. Take the disk and a razor blade and cut it
open very carfully where it was sealed by the disk company. Coat the
inside of the disk with the mixture but be sure not to get any on the
parts of the disk that show. Place the disk somewhere like between to
very heavy books so that the mixture will be flattened thoughly for one
day. Now you have a working disk drive bomb.

THE REACTION:

More (Y/N/NS): 

  When to two heads of the disk drive scrapes across the disk to read
the info. The match heads and nail polish remover reaction will cause
the disk to explode and goodby disk drive.

---------------------------------------
            THE LETTER BOMB
            ===============
INGREDENTS:
-----------
ALUMINUM POWDER
IRON POWDER
DOUBLE LAYERED PADDED ENVELOPE
MAGNESIUM POWDER
IODINE CRYSTALS
AMONIUM HYDROXIDE(IN LIQUID FORM)

  Mix about 75% aluminum powder with 25% of iron powder very well. The
idea is that iron can burn, but at a very high temperature. You could 
say it needs a little help. This is what the aluminum is for, aluminum 
burns at a relativly low temperature,so its used as a catalyst. Magnesium
is used to flash ignite the aluminum, which in turn burns the iron, at a 

More (Y/N/NS): 

suitable temperature. Since this will go off in an enclosed space it 
will burn much hotter and slower than usual.Now, get the envolope, 
Seperate the layers. In the inner layer goes the mixture. The outer 
layer is filled with magnesium. Now for the hard part. We now have to
make the fuse from anthor set of chemicals: Iodine crystals and amonium
hydroxide. Mix these together in about an equal amount, but you might 
want to use a heavy amount of iodine if pressed for time. These form a
crystalline structure, about an inch long. These are highly volatile, 
and I advise in keeping then protected. They have an impact power of an
M-100 per teaspoon. Put these in the lining at the top, and rig this so 
it puts the pressure on the crystals when the package is opened. 
Now you have a working letter bomb.

---------------------------------------

            THE SMOKE BOMB
            ==============
INGEDENTS:
----------
SUGAR
POTASSIUM NITRATE(SALT)


More (Y/N/NS): 

  Mix 4 parts surgar and 6 parts salt. Heat over a low flame until it 
melts, stir well. Pour into container. Before it solidifies inbed a few 
matches as fuses into the mixture. One pound fills an entire block with 
smoke.

---------------------------------------

           SIMPLE LAND MINE
           ================
MATERIALS:
----------
6 SHOTGUN SHELLS(BUCKSHOT TYPE)
PIECE OF CARDBOARD(FOUND IN PANTY HOSE
PACKAGES)
6 ROOFING NAILS
6 CORKS
6 CARDBOARD CYLINDERS(FOUND IN TOILET
PAPER ROLLS)

  Place each shotgun shell in cardboard cylinders. Take the corks and 
insert them into one end or the cardboard cylinder and leave the other 

More (Y/N/NS): 

end open. Make a whole in the center of each cork but make sure the 
roofing nail fits in snuggly. Now take the peice of cadboard and make in 
a circle shape so all 6 shotgun shells with fit in it. Now tape up the 
cardboard and place the entire package in the ground, but make sure the 
nails are facing the ground so the buckshot will hit anyone who steps
on it.

---------------------------------------

          MAKING A CAR EXPLODE
          ====================
MATERIALS:
----------
MEDICINE BOTTLE
LIQUID DRANO

   Take out all the pills from the medicine bottle. Pour liquid drano 
in the bottle and seal it back up, hold it upside down to see if it 
leaks, if it does thats great. Put some vasaline petroleum jelly around 
the cap. When the drano eats through the bottle or vasaline, it will
cause a chemical reaction with the gas, and explode.

More (Y/N/NS): 


---------------------------------------

          THE SODA BOTTLE BOMB
          ====================
INGREDENTS:
-----------
GLASS SODA BOTTLE(NEW)
SALT

    Shake the bottle throughly by putting the bottle in a sock and shake
it around your head. Dip the bottle in vasealine, and roll it around in 
salt. Make sure the salt is still on the bottle and find a crowd of 
people then throw it in to the crowd, when it busts the glass will 
going flying into their legs, but not only that thre will we salt all
over the glass, and thats very painful.

                    How to Make Black Powder

     Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner.  It may be
used as blasting or gun powder.

Material required:
-----------------
Potassium Nitrate, granulated, 3 cups

Wood Charcoal, powdered, 2 cups

Sulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup

Alcohol, 5 pints (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)

Water, 3 cups

heat source

2 buckets -- each 2 gallon capacity, at least one of which is heat

More (Y/N/NS): 

resistant (metal, ceramic, etc.)

Flat window screening, at least 1 ft. Square large wooden stick cloth, 
at least 2 ft. Square note: the above amounts will yield 2 pounds of 
black powder. However, only the ratios of the amounts of the ingredients
are important. Thus, for twice as much black powder, double all 
quantities used.

Procedure:
---------

1) place alcohol in one of the buckets

2) place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant
bucket.  Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all 
ingredients are dissolved.

3) Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture.  Place bucket on heat source 
and stir until small bubbles begin to form.

Caution:  do not boil mixture.  Be sure all mixture stays wet.  If any

More (Y/N/NS): 

          is dry, as on sides of pan, it may ignite.

4) Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
   vigorously.

5) Let alcohol stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to
   obtain black powder.  Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around black powder 
   and squeeze to remove all excess liquid.

6) Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable amount of damp powder 
   on screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen.

note: If granulated particles appear to stick together and change shape, 
      recombine entire batch of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.

7) Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about
   1/2 inch is formed.  Allow to dry.  Use radiator , or direct
   sunlight.  This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in
   one hour.  The longer the drying period, the less effective the
   black powder.


More (Y/N/NS): 

Caution: remove from heat as soon as granules are dry.  Black powder
         is now ready for use.

TO ALL PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN GIVING THE PHONE COMPANY 25 CENTS FOR
A CALL, OR EVEN A DIME, THIS IS FOR YOU.
 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE  COUNTRY BUT HERE IN N.Y.C. THEY HAVE
ARMOURED THE PAY-PHONES WITH STEEL PLATES SURROUNDING THE BOTTOM HALF OF
THE PHONE. THIS SHEILD WILL WITHSTANDANY ATTACK BY M-80'S, BLOCK-BUSTERS,
SUPER-BLOCKBUSTERS, ASH-CANS, PINAPPLES, ETC...... (EXCEPT DINAMITE)TO 
DESTROY THIS PLATING AND MOST OF THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PHONE, USE THE 
FOLLOWING DEVICE.
 
FIRST YOU MUST BLOW OUT THE HING ON THE COIN RETURN SLOT. THIS CAN BE 
DONE WITH MOST CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS SUCH AS A BLOCK-BUSTER. THEN, TAKE 
A 6 INCH SECTION OF THE SAME TYPE OF BENDABLE METAL TUBING THAT SURROUNDS 
THE WIRE TO THE RECIEVER, BUT IT MUST BE AT LEAST 1 INCH IN DIAMETER.
THEN, SOLDER A PEICE OF SHEET METAL ON TO ONE SIDE OF THE TUBE TO SEAL 
THAT SIDE. THEN FILL THE TUBE WITH THE SAME FLASH-POWDER USED IN BLOCK
BUSTERS AND FILL THAT END WITH STRONG EPOXY TO SEAL IT. ONE THING I 
FORGOT TO MENTION, BEFORE SOLDERING THE ROUND PEICE OF SHEET METAL TO 
THE TUBE, DRILL A SMALL HOLE IN IT JUST BIG ENOUGH TO FIT A PEICE OF

More (Y/N/NS): 

DEMOLITION FUSE THROUGH. THEN PUT THE PEICE THOUGH BEFORE FILLING IT. 
SEAL THE EDGES OF THE FUSE WITH THE SAME EPOXY USED TO SEAL THE OPPOSITE 
END OF TUBE.
 
THEN, WHEN COMPLETE, SHOVE THE THING UP INTO THE COIN SLOT WITH THE EPOXY
END GOING IN FIRST. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT DIMES, NICKELS, AND 
QUARTERS FALLING ALL AROUND YOU.
 
 
            ***WARNING***

     I have decided to skip the article on mercury fluminate for a
while and get right into the dynamite article.

     Dynamite is nothing more than just nitroglycerin and a stablizing
agent to make it much safer to use.  For the sake of saving time, I
will abbreviate nitroglycerin with a plain NG.  The numbers
are percentages, be sure to mix these carefully and be sure to use the
exact amounts.  These percentages are in weight ratio, not volume.

can always buy small amounts from your school, or maybe from various
chemical companies.  When you do that, be sure to say as little as
possible, if during the school year, and they ask, say it's for a
experement for school.

                    How To Make Nitro-Glycerin

                  

(How Nitro explodes--note that the byproducts are nothing but
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and oxygen)

     Nitroglycerin [heretofore Nitro] is a very powerful high-
explosive.  I am not sure who invented it but he probably didn't-- the
first person to make it probably blew himself up and his freind got
the info off his notes. Well anyway, the next best thing to Nitro is
TNT which is ten times harder to make but also ten times safer to
make.  If you can't use common sense then dont even TRY to make 
this stuff--a few drops can be lethal under certaincircumstances.

                            To make Nitro:
                            == ==== ======

     Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid (for best results it should have
a specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume') with 200 parts sulphuric
acid.  This is going to be HOT at first--it won't splatter if you pour

More (Y/N/NS): 

the nitric INTO the sulphuric but don't try it the other way around.
The acid solutions together can disolve flesh in a matter of seconds
so take the proper measures for God's sake!!!  When cool, add 38 parts
glycerine as slowly as possible. Let it trickle down the sides of the
container into the acids or it won't mix thourily and the reaction
could go to fast--which causes enough heat to ignite the stuff.  Stir
with a **GLASS** rod for 15 seconds or so then CARFULLY pour it into
20 times it's *VOLUME* of water.  It will visibly precipitate
immediatly. there will be twice as much Nitro as you used glycerin and
it is easy to separate.  Mix it with baking soda as soon as you have
separated it-- this helps it not to go off spontainously.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
  NOTES:  Parts are by weight and the Baume' scale of spicific gravity
can be found in most chem. books.  You can get fuming nitric and
sulfuric acids wherever good chemicals or fertilizers are sold.  It is
positivly *STUPID* to make more than 200 grams of Nitro at a time.
When mixing the stuff wear goggles, gloves, etc.  When I first made
the stuff I had the honor of having it go off by itself (I added too
much glycerine at a time.)  I was across the room at the time, but I
felt the impact--so did the table it was on as well as the window it

More (Y/N/NS): 

was next to--they were both smashed by only 25 grams in an open bowl.
Oh, yes, glycerine you can get at any pharmacy and you need an adult
signature for the acids.  Any bump can make Nitro go off if you don't
add the bicarbonate of (baking) soda--but even with that, if it gets
old I wouldn't play catch with it.

     Once you have made the Nitro and saturated it with Bicarb. you
can make a really powerful explosive that won't go off by itself by
simply mixing it with as much cotton as you can and then saturating
that with molten ((parifine--just enough to make it sealed and hard.
Typically, use the same amounts (by weight) of each Nitro, cotton and
parifine.  This, when wrapped in newspaper, was once known as "Norbin
& Ohlsson's Patent Dynamite," but that was back in 1896.
