Method 1) Yeah,there's this loser that you really hate,and you just happen to
have his home phone # and address...Well,those two pieces of info are very
important and will make the difference in whether this file will work for you
or not...So you now have the info(I am assuming you have gotten it already)
Ah,now the fun will begin...Here are some things,tryed out by myself,and they
are VERY effective! No shit!
A)Ok you will need some music magazines(c'mon you've gotta have a few around
the house!) and access to a xerox machine..How do i get access to a xerox
machine you say? Well,your school has one,now,doesn't it...Now,what to do..
Take the music magazines(circus,hit parader,kerrang,any will do) and leaf
through them...cut out logos and pictures of groups..Cut them out neatly so
it looks professional..Yeah,now,assemble the logos and pics into a nice layout.
Now,think of a name for your "concert"...you've got all these metal group
logos so bill it that all those groups are playing on one night..Then type,
or write in(remember this MUST look professional) somethin like this:
So,if you want tickets to "(name of your fake concert)" contac:
                         (loser's real name,1st and last)
                   at:(loser's phone number)
                   or write him at:
                   (loser's address)
Now,print up a few hundred(at least) and go around posting them up all over.
This has been done and is a kick-ass,sure fire method...
2)Well,you could go to a place with complaint forms,and fill out his name,
# and address,ragging the shit out of whatever place you got the form from..
They will usually get back to the loser and not be very friendly...
3)You could put his name on every mailing list possible,write for free samples
of stuff in his name,etc. I find this to be a boring and repetitive method,
use only as a last resort.

Method 2:Ya only got his phone number huh? Oh,well,we can have fun with this
too...
1)War-dial it for a few days.
2)Distribute it as a phone sex line
3)Yeah,the dude's opening up a 50 meg bbs/cf/ae! yeah!! Really? Sure....
4)Think of your own,I mean,if you cant be creative,then dont bother at all...
Method 3:Dammit! Just the address 'eh? Let's see what we have here..
1)Does the pizzaria deliver at 2:00 am? Of course it does!
2)So does car-services and limosine services!
3)Post an ad for a gay men group therapy session on the back page of the
Village Voice(didnt do this one yet but it is a definate next prank)
giving the losers address..
4)Ya know those commercials that sell cash on delivery items like:craftmatic
adjustible bed,imitation gold necklace,phony diamond earrings,and other such
lovelys,and then they give you an 800 number to call and order..Sure ya do..
Order them a shit load of any item you see...accumulate a list whenever you
watch T.V. and then when the time comes,bring out the list,and give the loser
a years supply of Ronco products and all that other shit...works every time!

Ok well thats about it for the first edition of Anarchy and You...look for
more editions cause im always making up more of these things...go out and
have a ball..Hope ya enjoyed it because i loved doin them...
