                      The Anarchists Toolkit
                          by Black Dragon

In order to shorten time and heighten destructive powers, here is a
comprehensive guide to house-wrapping/yard-destruction.

Materials Needed
----------------
1 duffel bag
1 pair black clothing
2 bottles of Karo corn syrup
1 pair wire cutters
1 tube of super glue
1-1000 rolls of toilet paper
4 newspapers, shredded
1-4 cans of shaving cream
1 knife - preferably a dagger
1 can of Holiday Fogger (or other brand)
1 pair of hedge trimmers (non-electric)
1 box of Sun Light brand dishwasher detergent
1-12 eggs
1 siphon
??? as much leftover shampoo, liquid soap, etc. as can be found
1 homemade rocket-launcher


The Duffel Bag : $5

Preferably cheap and big.  Used to carry all equipment except for
the following :

wire cutters
super glue
knife
rocket launcher

The above are to be carried at all times.  You see, in this way, the
first three items can be kept on the person (pockets, sheath), and
the rocket launcher can be carried over 1 shoulder.  The bag is
carried in the other hand.


The Clothes : $20

On sale, dark blue jeans and a black jacket can be found, or most
probably, you already have them.  Shoes, I have found, do not matter,
but a dark shirt is also desirable to keep the heat down from the
jacket.  Gloves are of use as well.


The Corn Syrup : $1 per bottle

Dump one in the gas tank and pour one all over any cars.  It's awe-
some.  Please BEWARE!  This causes major damage to transmission and is
a felony if you get caught.  Also, on my most recent outing, I was al-
most caught and had to run with the shit open in my hand.  Do NOT do
this!  It will spill all over you and fuck you over.  I had to get
my leather jacket cleaned for that - $35.


The Wire Cutters : $1

Cut the cable, electricity, and/or telephone lines as well as the
antennae of any automibiles.


The Super Glue : $1.30 for two tubes

Squeeze into locks and door handles, etc.  Don't get this shit in your
eyes or hair, like my freind did.  And remember to puncture the little
aluminum thing inside first.


The Toilet Paper : $1 for 4 rolls

Duh...wrap trees, but DO NOT spend too much time with this.  It's
really boring and not too much of a hassle to clean.


The Newspaper : $.25 per issue

Shred it up and throw it into the yard.  This should be kept in a
seperate bag for minumum time.  It looks awesome but takes forever
to do and sometimes isn't worth the effort.


The Shaving Cream : $.90 per can

Spray in mailbox, on house, on car, anywhere.  I also recommend knock-
ing the mailbox down if you don't make too much noise.


The Knife : $10 for a good dagger

For protection against the homeowner and for tire-slashing.


The Fogger : $2.50

Start it up and throw it through a window (at the end).  This is
explained in further detail in an earlier file of mine...but I
don't know what it was called.


The Hedge-Trimmers : $10?

Give the people some free landscaping.  It's fun, it's easy, but
it makes noise.  This is hilarious and can be real exciting, but the
owner may just hear it!


The Detergent : $2?

Pour onto the lawn, it kills the grass.  Write messages if wanted.


The Eggs : $1 for 12

Egg the house, car, or anything else.


The Siphon : $3.50

Take the gas while you're there!  If there are garbage cans around you
can get the gas and pour it on the lawn for more killing power.


The Leftovers : Free

Pour on or around the front door and windows.  Can make a big mess.


The Rocket-Launcher : $20-$30

Blow out a window or blow up a person.  Note : HERE ARE THE PLANS FOR
A ONE-TIME-USAGE ROCKET LAUNCHER, WHICH DEFINATELY HAS THE POWER TO
KILL SOMEONE.

First, get a long board, 29" long, 4" wide, and 1/2" thick.  Then get
a 21" long, 4 1/2" diameter pipe with 1 cap.  Get a strip of stick-on
Velcro.  Now, buy an Estes model rocket kit that includes a control-
ler, blast plate, and launch pole.  Construct the controller (this
is really very simple).  Drill a hole in the cap big enough for the
wires from the controller to fit through.  Now, super glue the small,
6-sided plastic base to the center of the inside of the cap.  Put the
launch rod into the base and the blast plate on the launch rod.  Glue
of weld the plate on.  Also, drill a hole through the plate for the
wires, or leave roomm around the edge for the wires to go.  Now, nail
or glue the pipe to the board and apply one side of the Velcro to the
board piece behind that.  Put the rest of the Velcro on the underside
of the controller.  Nail/glue a handle of some sort to the end of the
board.  Here's what it shold look like :

                                       | handle |
                                       |        |
                                       |        |
                                       ----------

Now, construct a rocket and glue the nose cone on.  This will cause
the rocket to blow up when the ejection charge goes off.  Do not
put on the fins!  I know this makes it very unstable, but the rocket
just isnt going to fit if you have them!  I suggest testing this
with a mosquito rocket with the smallest engine, firing with the
controller in you hand and the wires stretched out.  Also, use
only one piece of the launch rod, or else it will be too long.
Now, to set it up, remove the cap, which should come out with the
base and launch rod, and put a readied rocket onto the rod.  Hook
up the clips to the ignitor and put the launcher back together.  Now,
remove the controller and stand back.  Test fire it at something solid
once, and once into the air.  Also, sequential launchers may be
constructed with 2 controllers, for 2 use rockets, but they have to
be fired in order of which rocket was put on last!  Have fun with this
item.
