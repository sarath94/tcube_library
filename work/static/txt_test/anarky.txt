        IMPROVISING BLACK POWDER

BLACK POWDER, TERRORIST FUN, HARMLESS  TERROR, ELECTRONIC TERROR AND FREE
POSTAGE.

            BLACK POWDER

    BLACK POWDER CAN BE PREPARED IN A  SIMPLE, SAFE MANNER.  IT MAY BE USED AS
BLASTING OR GUN POWDER.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:

POTASSIUM NITRATE, GRANULATED, 3 CUPS

WOOD CHARCOAL, POWDERED, 2 CUPS

SULFUR, POWDERED, 1/2 CUP

ALCOHOL, 5 PINTS (WHISKEY, RUBBING  ALCOHOL, ETC.)

WATER, 3 CUPS

             CARBIDE BOMB

THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. EXERCISE  EXTREME CAUTION.... OBTAIN SOME CALCIUM
CARBIDE.  THIS IS THE STUFF THAT IS  USED IN CARBIDE LAMPS AND CAN BE FOUND
AT NEARLY ANY HARDWARE STORE. TAKE A  FEW PIECES OF THIS STUFF (IT LOOKS LIKE
GRAVEL)AND PUT IT IN A GLASS JAR WITH  SOME WATER. PUT A LID ON TIGHTLY. THE
CARBIDE WILL REACT WITH THE WATER TO  PRODUCE ACETYLENE CARBONATE WHICH IS
SIMILAR TO THE GAS USED IN CUTTING  TORCHES. EVENTUALLY THE GLASS WITH
EXPLODE FROM INTERNAL PRESSURE.  IF  LEAVE A BURNING RAG NEARBY, YOU WILL
GET A NICE FIREBALL!

                                               PORTABLE GRENADE LAUNCHER

IF YOU HAVE A BOW, THIS ONE IS FOR  YOU.  REMOVE THE FERRULE FROM AN
ALUMINUM ARROW, AND FILL THE ARROW  WITH BLACK POWDER (I USE GRADE FFFF, IT
BURNS EASY)AND THEN GLUE A SHOTSHELL  PRIMER INTO THE HOLE LEFT WHERE THE
FERRULE WENT. NEXT, GLUE A BB ON THE  PRIMER, AND YOU ARE READY TO GO! MAKE
SURE NO ONE IS NEARBY.. LITTLE SHREDS  OF ALUMINIM GO ALL OVER THE PLACE!!

     AUTO TO EXHAUST FLAME THROWER

FOR THIS ONE, ALL YOU NEED IS A CAR,   SPARKPLUG, IGNITION WIRE AND A SWITCH.
INSTALL THE SPARK PLUG INTO THE LAST  FOUR OR FIVE INCHES OF THE TAILPIPEBY
DRILLING A HOLE THAT THE PLUG CAN  SCREW INTO EASILY. ATTACH THE WIRE
(THIS IS REGULAR INSULATED WIRE) TO  ONE SIDE OF THE SWITCH AND TO THE SPARK
PLUG. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH IS  ATTACHED TO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL ON
THE BATTERY. WITH THE CAR RUNNING,  SIMPLY HIT THE SWITCH AND WATCH THE
FLAMES FLY!!! AGAIN BE CAREFUL THAT  ONE IS BEHIND YOU! I HAVE SEEN SOME OF
THESE FLAMES GO 20 FEET!!!

            FREE POSTAGE!!

THE INCREASING COST OF POSTAGE TO  LETTERS AND PACKAGES IS BRINGING DOWN
OUR STANDARD OF LIVING.  TO REMEDY  THIS DEPLORABLE SITUATION, SOME COUNTER
CONTROL MEASURES CAN BE APPLIED.  FOR  EXAMPLE, IF THE STAMPS ON A LETTER ARE
COATED WITH ELMER'S GLUE BY THE  SENDER, THE CANCELLATION MARK WILL NOT
DESTROY THE STAMP: THE ELMER/S DRIVES  TO FORM AN ALMOST INVISIBLE COATING
THAT PROTECTS THE STAMPS FROM THE  CANCELLATION INK. LATER, THE RECEIVER
IF THE LETTER CAN REMOVE THE  CANCELLATION MARK WITH WATER AND REUSE
THE STAMPS. FURTHERMORE, ECOLOGICAL  SAVING WILL ALSO RESULT FROM RECYCLING
THE STAMPS.  HELP SAVE A TREE.

THE GLUE IS MOST EFFICENTLY APPLIED  WITH A BRUSH WITH STIFF, SHORT
BRISTLES.  JUST DIP THE BRUSH INTO THE  GLUE AND SPREAD IT ON EVENLY,
COVERING THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE  STAMP.  IT WILL DRY IN ABOUT 15 MIN.

FOR MAILING PACKAGES, JUST FOLLOW THE  SAME PROCEDURE AS OUTLINED ABOVE;
HOWEVER, THE PACKAGE SHOULD BE AND  CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS
THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF POSTAGE ON IT  BEFORE IT IS TAKEN TO THE POST OFFICE.

REMOVING THE CANCELLATION AND THE FROM  THE STAMPS CAN BE EASILY ACCOMPLISHED
BY SOAKING THE STAMPS IN WARM WATER  UNTIL THEY FLOAT FREE FROM THE PAPER.
THE STAMPS CAN THEN BE PUT ONTO A  PAPER TOWEL TO DRY.  PROCESSING
STAMPS IN LARGE BATCHES SAVES TIME  TOO.  ALSO, IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO WRITE
THE WORD 'ELMER' AT THE TOP OF THE  LETTER (NOT ON THE ENVELOPE) TO CUE THE
RECEIVING PARTY IN THAT THE STAMPS  HAVE BEEN PROTECTED WITH THE GLUE.

WE ALL KNOW THAT MAILING PACKAGES CAN  BE EXPENSIVE.  AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT
THE HANDICAPPED ARE SOMETIMES  DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN JOBS. THE
GOVERNMENT, BEING THE GENEROUS PEOPLE  THEY ARE, HAVE GIVEN THE BLIND FREE
POSTAL SERVICE.

SIMPLY ADDRESS YOU ENVELOPE AS USUAL,  AND MAKE ONE MODIFICATION. IN THE
CORNER WHERE THE STAMP WOULD GO, IN  (OR STAMP) THE WORDS 'FREE MATTER
FOR THE BLIND".  THEN DROP YOU OR  LETTER IN ONE OF THE BLUE FEDRAL
MAILBOXES.  DO NOT TAKE THE LETTER TO  THE POST OFFICE, OR LEAVE IT IN YOUR
MAILBOX.

SOUNDS VERY NICE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO  DO THIS, RIGHT?  WELL, THEY AREN'T THAT
NICE.  THE PARCEL IS SENT LIBRARY  RATE, THAT IS BELOW THIRD CLASS.  IT
MAY TAKE FOUR TO FIVE DAYS TO SEND A  LETTER TO JUST THE NEXT TOWN.

THIS TOO IS QUITE SIMPLE, BUT LESS  EFFECTIVE.  PUT THE ADDRESS THAT YOU
ARE SENDING THE LETTER TO AS THE  RETURN ADDRESS.  IF YOU WERE SENDING A
$20 DONATION TO THE PIRATE'S CHEST,  YOU WOULD PUT OUR ADDRESS (PO BOX 644,
LINCOLN MA. 01773) AS THE RETURN  ADDRESS.

THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE CARLESS AND  FORGET TO PUT THE STAMP ON THE
ENVELOPE.  A NICE TOUCH IS TO PUT A  BULLSHIT ADDRESS IN THE CENTER OF THE
ENVELOPE.  AGAIN, YOU MUST DROP THE  LETTER IN A FEDRAL MAILBOX.  IF THE
POST OFFICE DOESN'T SEND THE LETTER  THE RETURN ADDRESS FOR HAVING NO STAMP,
THEY WILL SEND IT BACK FOR THE REASON  OF "NO SUCH ADDRESS".

EXAMPLE--

  PIRATES CHEST
  P.O. BOX 644
  LINCOL, MA.
  01773

                       TOM BULLSHIT
                       20 FAKE ROAD
                       WHAT EVER, XX
                       99851


ONE LAST THING YOU MIGHT TRY DOING IS  SOAKING A CANCELLED STAMP OFF OF AN
ENVELOPE, AND GLUING IT ONTO ONE YOU  ARE SENDING.  THEN BURN THE STAMP,
LEAVEING A LITTLE BIT TO SHOW THAT  THERE WAS ONE THERE.

               FIREBOMBS

MOST FIRE BOMBS ARE SIMPLY GASOLINE  FILLED BOTTLES WITH A FUEL SOAKED RAG
IN THE MOUTH (THE BOTTLE'S MOUTH, NOT  YOURS). THE ORIGINAL MOLOTOV COCKTAIL,
AND STILL ABOUT THE BEST, WAS A  MIXTURE OF ONE PART GASOLINE AND ONE
PART MOTOR OIL. THE OIL HELPS IT TO  CLING TO WHAT IT SPLATTERS ON.

SOME USE ONE PART ROOFING TAR AND ONE  PART GASOLINE. FIRE BOMBS HAVE BEEN
FOUND WHCIH WERE MADE BY POURING  MELTED WAX INTO GASOLINE.

              MATCH HEAD BOMB

SIMPLE SAFETY MATCH HEADS IN A PIPE,   CAPPED AT BOTH ENDS, MAKE A DEVESTATING
BOMB.  IT IS SET OFF WITH A REGULAR  FUSE A PLASTIC BAGGIE IS PUT INTO THE
PIPE BEFORE THE HEADS GO IN TO  DETONATION BY CONTACT WITH THE METAL.
CUTTING ENOUGH MATCH HEADS TO FILL  PIPE CAN BE TEDIOUS WORK FOR ONE BUT AN
EVENING'S FUN FOR THE FAMILY IF YOU  CAN DRAG THEM AWAY FROM THE TV.


         FUSE IGNITION FIRE BOMB

A FOUR STRAND HOMEMADE FUSE IS USED  FOR THIS.  IT BURNS LIKE FURY. IT IS
HELD DOWN AND CONCEALED BY A STRIP OF  BENT TIN CUT FROM A CAN.  THE EXPOSED
END OF THE FUSE IS DIPPED INTO THE  FLARE IGNITER. TO USE THIS ONE, YOU
LIGHT THE FUSE AND HOLD THE FIRE BOMB  UNTIL THE FUSE HAS BURNED OUT OF SIGHT
UNDER THE TIN. THEN THROW IT AND WHEN  IT BREAKS, THE BURNING FUSE WILL IGNITE
THE CONTENTS.

          =/= GETTING EVEN =/=

TO GET EVEN WITH AN EX TRADING OFFER  TO SEND HIM THE NEWEST WARE BY
MAIL. BUT BEFORE YOU DO THIS TAKE THE  DISK OUT OF ITS JACKET AND DO THE
FOLLOWING:
TAKE A SMALL DISH AND POUR ACETONE  (NAIL POLISH REMOVER) INTO IT. NOW GET
LOTSA MATCHEADS AND PUT THEM IN IT.   NOW PULVERIZE IT UNTIL YOU HAVE A
SOMEWHAT GOOEY CONSISTENCY. THIS IS  WHAT YOU SHOULD BRUSH ON THE DISK IN A
THIN LAYER BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE A  CLEAN AREA TO SHOW THRU THE ENVELOPE.
NOW WHEN HE BOOTS IT, IT BOOTS HIM!!!
                 Napalm
                --------

    About the best fire bomb is  napalm. It has a thick consistancy,
like jam and is best for use on  vehilces or buildings.

    Napalms is simply one part  gasoline and one part soap.  The soap
is either soap flakes or shredded bar  soap. Detergents won't do.

    The gasoline must be heated in  order for the soap to melt. The usual
way is with a double boiler where the  top part has at least a two-quart
capicity. The water in the bottom part  is brought to a boil and the double
boiler is taken from the stove and  carried to where there is no flame.

   Then one part, by volume, of  gasoline is put in the top part and
allowed to heat as much as it will and  the soap is added and the mess is
stirred until it thickens. A better  way to heat gasoline is to fill
a bathtub with water as hot as you can  get it. It will hold its heat longer
and permit a much larger container  than will the double boiler.
