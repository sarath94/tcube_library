* As in Manual I, I am in no way responsible for any damages,
* accidents, or injuries incurred while working on an experiment from this
* Manual. I did not make you to do these experiments, and as far as I am
* concerned, this is for information only.

 Welcome to Manual II of the Anarchy Files. Here we will introduce you into
the world of anarchy, and real fun.

1. Fire Tricks

 We can start right off the bat with fire tricks. Right now, I want you to
go find a few items you'll have around your house and play with them. Find
out if they're flammable or not, and see if you can do simple things with
them (like making a blow torch out of a hair spray bottle, making a simple
Molotov cocktail out of a flammable aftershave flask).
I suggest you to do these outside, and make the results BIG.
If that means setting your neighbors fence on fire, so be it (but this
early i suggest you put it out before they notice). The Molotov cocktail
out of aftershave lotion is one of my favorite beginning anarchy tricks.
Dont forget normal items you wouldnt suspect. Have an extra glide on
deodorant? light it up and throw it against the wood pile!
First start off with some simple chemicals and then start doing stuff with
after shave, deodorant and such. Suggested chemicals: Rubbing Alcohol,
Glycerin, and assorted kitchen foods. Then go onto perfumes, nasal
medicines, and aerosols. Its all right if you go too big (one person I know
accidently torched his tree. Took him 10 minutes to get it out. Luckily his
mother didnt notice even though the rest of the neighborhood did).



  Okay, lets get down to some more basic stuff. This isn't really
necessary except if you are heavily into demolitions. Then you
might want to memorize it, but it's nothing big. These are three
ways to start a small chemical fire. The chemicals are available
from a chemistry supply, or a # of other places. Try your local
drug store. (Thanks to Zaphod Beeblebrox)

 1) Take a few crystals of chromic anhydride and drop on some ethyl alcohol.
 It will make a small harmless flame instantly.
 2) Next, Mix 4 parts ammonium chloride, 1 part ammonium nitrate, 4 parts
 powdered zinc (mix by wieght). Drop some water on it and stand back. See as
 it makes pretty lights.
 3) Place a small pile of sodium on the ground outside, and drop water on it,
 only a drop or two. Watch it make a nice waterproof campfire.

Chapter 2. Pressure

  This is the most important chapter of this manual, and it ranks
 up pretty high among all of them. This chapter deals with Pressure and its
 effects. Pressure is one of the basics of anarchy and destruction, on the
 same level as Fire and physical abuse. Say you have an adamantium pipe that
 needs to be disassembled (I wouldnt know why but this is our example).
 There's not a chance in hell you can even put a dent on it. You can forget
 trying to burn it too. So how does this pipe get sufficiently damaged? Okay,
 lets say its a part of a russian tank. It has a cap that goes on one end and
 it screws into a outlet on the firewall. You need to sufficiently fuck over
 this tank. The cool calm anarchist says "Easy" as he pulls out either a
 little baking soda and vinegar, or his tin foil and copper etchant. He just
 pops the baking soda or tin foil in the pipe, and then pours in the vinegar
 or copper etchant and caps it as tight as he can, and hauls ass out of that
 tank. Assuming that the pipe is sealed or blocked on the other end and there
 is no way for the pressure to escape, * ka-boom *, no more pipe. And no more
 prisoners if you left them in the tank. This is because along with pressure,
 comes the effect: Shrapnel. And large chunks of adamantium aren't something
 to hang around... Pressure is a surprisingly easy thing to come by. And the
 weaker and more brittle the material, the easier it breaks. Let's try our
 first "bomb".
  ---Ingrdients:
  1 liter plastic bottle
  copper
  etchant
  Tin Foil

  Copper etchant is bought at any radio shack. It is used for making PC
  boards. First, make sure the bottle is clean and dry. Then put in tin foil
  strips about 1 by 3 inches wich are rolled up length-wise. Take it outside,
  get a funnel, have a friend hold it and get ready to screw on the cap, while
  you pour the etchant in through the funnel. It only needs about a 1/4".
  Screw it up and throw. In about 45 seconds (dont rush, you have plenty of
  time for a one liter bottle), the bottle will excrete a large sound and a
  huge amount of lethal gas. Make sure you have about 20 feet clearance. You
  dont want to be hit by the bottle when it takes off. A variation on this is
  to not screw the cap so tight and point it at your dog. In about 25 seconds
  the cap shoots off like a 22. As you probably guessed, the etchant forms a
  chemical reaction with the tin foil which produces gas. You can only fit so
  much gas in a certain area, because the gas tries to "push" back the more
  scrunched it gets. It is a very hot form, and it doesnt want to be
  compacted. When the push of the gas gets more than the bottle can take, *
  Blooey *. Save the first husk of a bottle (if you can find it) for a
  souveneir to show your friends. Anyway you get the idea. Here is a list of
  combinations of chemicals that will make gas. Each is given a rating of 1 to
  10 to show how fast they give off gas.

 *  Copper Etchant + Tin Foil: 8
    Vinegar + Baking Soda: 3
 *  Nitric Acid + Copper (pennies): 10
 *  Hydrochloric Acid + Aluminum (in any form): 9

  Well, the slowest I can think of is the Second one, so these should
 basically cover your needs. Note that all of the ones with the * besides
 them are poisonous and also produce tremendous heat. If you examined the
 remains of the above bomb, you can see what kind of things pressure is
 capable of. There was very little pressure in there (about 1/8000th of some
 type of plastic explosives we'll be making) and yet it ripped the wall of the
 bottle off, warped it, and possibly blew the cap into that magical places of
 places, Bufu Egypt. With a few ounces of Plastique or nitro, you have the
 power to blow someone's home sky high.
  (The other da9 me and a few of my friends went out to the forest and blew
  one of these babies off. It was a three liter RC. I said it would go off
  in  3 minutes and the bitch went off 30 feet away from me in about 45
  seconds. Anyway, It's the thicker the bottle, the bigger the boom. Don't
  waste your shit trying to get a bigger boom and pouring a whole bottle
  in).

  Most combinations give off some type of gas, some poisonous, some hot,
 some neither. I listed a few of the most simplist up there, due to the fact
 that we aren't far enough yet to get into real chemical warfare.

 Chapter 3: Gun powder

  Gunpowder is one of the most useful things you can run into. Depending on
 how it is packed, it can burn for an hour or so, or blow your friends c-64
 to holy heaven. Gunpowder is one of the earliest explosives discovered, and
 definitly the most widely used.
    Ingredients for make-do gunpowder

  70% Salt Peter/Potassium Nitrate
  20% Charcoal
  10% Sulphur
     powder all ingredients and if desired, bake in 200 degree oven for 10
  to drive out moisture (it helps). Mix until powder is a greyish color.

  To detonate: Loose unpacked gunpowder is very flammable, and will burn for
 quite a long time. But to get it to go off, it must be lit in an enclosed
 place. The denser it is, the more dangerous and powerful it is.

  How to build an experimental house:

 What you need:
  4 balsa wood  12" by 4"
  4 balsa wood  5" by 4"
  1 balsa wood  5 1/2" by 12 1/2"
  240 cubic centimeters of cement
  13" x 13" by 4" pan
  dirt
  rocks
  other miniature background props (trees, fake grass)

   This is the house that you can build to do with as you please. You can
  burn it down, blow it up, or put your little dollies in it. First, make
  the cement. now take 2 pieces of the first two types of balsa wood and
  make a 5" by 12" square in the bottom of the pan. Fill your square with
  the cement you made and pack it down and smooth it. Wait until it starts
  to set and then take the remaining 4 pieces of the first two types of
  balsa wood and make the walls of the house in the cement. Let this dry
  until everything is firmly in there. Then attach the 5" by 12" piece as
  the roof with more cement or wood glue. You can also cut windows and other
  shit into the house, and even go so far as to put walls in and second
  stories and shit. After the house is built then fill in the pan with dirt
  and decorate as you please...
   Blowing up your house:
  This should be pretty obvious. Burning it down is pretty stupid because
  you just wasted a good house. You can stick a ping pong ball filled with
  gun powder in it and light it off, set in a few fire crackers as miniature
  pipe bombs, or try napalm in a thimble. Whatever pleases you.

   Thats the end of Manual 2, hope you liked it. One thing though...please
   delete manual 1, cuz it was very late when i wrote it. You can ignore the
   whole thing if you want (even you fatasses).
