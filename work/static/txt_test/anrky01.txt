To all people who don't believe in giving
the phone company 25 cents for
a call, or even a dime, this is for you
 
I don't know about the rest of the
country but here in N.Y.C. they have
armoured the pay-phones with steel
plates surrounding the bottom half of
the phone. This sheild will withstand
any attack by M-80's, block-busters,
super-blockbusters, ash-cans,
pineapples, etc...... (Except Dynamite)
to destroy this plating and most of the
bottom half of the phone, use the
following device.
 
First you must blow out the hing on the
coin return slot. This can be done with
most conventional weapons such as a
block-buster.
Then, take a 6 inch section of the same
type of bendable metal tubing that
surrounds the wire to the reciever,
but it must be at least 1 inch in dia-
meter.
 
Then, solder a piece of sheet metal on
to one side of the tube to seal that
side. Then fill the tube with the same
flash-powder used in block-busters and
fill that end with strong epoxy to seal
it.
 
One thing I forgot to mention, before
soldering the round peice of sheet
metal to the tube, drill a small hole
in it just big enough to fit a peice of
demolition fuse through. Then put the
peice through before filling it.Seal
the edges of the fuse with the same
epoxy used to seal the opposite end of
the tube.
 
Then, when complete, shove the thing
up into the coin slot with the epoxy
end going in first.
 
Next thing you know you've got dimes,
nickels, and quarters falling all around
you.

The way to make an extremely explosive
and unstable contact substance is as
follows:
    Take any amount of iodine crystals
and put them in to a generous amount
of --CONSENTRATED-- ammonia and mix it
well. Then let it sit for about 1/2
hour and then mix it again. Then take
a coffee filter or real chem
filter and filter the solution through
it and collect the residue in the filter
and rinse it with ether or pure
alcohol.(ether is better) Do this
4 or 5 times. The Residue left will be
--HIGHLY-- unstable and explosive when
it dries so keep it in a paint form
with the ether and paint it where you
want. Since ether dries fast, the
substance is very good for terror. I've
already had some blow up in my face and
it wasn't very pleasurable so be careful
with it.

Condensation in a car's tank puts a layer of water on its bottom. Gelatin
capsules filled with one part calcium carbide and one part pure sodium are
dropped into a car's gas tank.  In a few minutes there is an explosion you
have to see to believe!!!!
 
Gelatin capsules, filled with more gelatin are bought at the supermarket.
the gelatin is emptied from the capsules and BB's are put into them so they
sink to the bottom.
Slivers of metallic sodium and chunks of carbide are then put into the capsules
...carry the capsules in a plastic bag to keep them dry.
 
 Three or four capsules are dropped into a car's gas tank. Several minutes
- half an hour later....The capsules disentegrate and the moisture turns
the carbide into explosive gas and also ignites the sodium.  The burning sodium
ignites the carbide gas there is a:

>>>If you have M80's or similiar
   take a seltzer CO2 canister and
   let out the CO2.Now cut out top
   almost off just leave a little
   hinge.Now place the M80 inside
   with fuse out the hole in top
   close the top part and either
   very carefully solder the top
   on or use extremely good epoxy
   ***********  LIGHT **********
    BOOOM MINY DYNAMITE
>>>If you don't have M80's poke a
   hole in the top of the canister
   and fill with black powder put
   fuse in and light.
>>>If you're using a detonator the
   top is sloped so just saw off
   enough for the det. To fit and
   seal with epoxy.

Go out and buy a "D" or "E" engine
rocket that is fairly simple.
Make the rocket like they say and then
fill the nose cone with some substance
that has the same weight or close to
flash-powder.
Detach the nose cone from the shock
cord so that only the body will be
connected to the parachute. Get a good
stopwatch and a pair of good binoculars
and launch the rocket straight up.
Watch the rocket and start timing when
the ejection charge blows the cone free
and stop timing right when the cone
  Impacts on the ground.
Then retrieve the body and get another
nose cone. Fill the nose cone with
flash powder and block up the hole with
model cement. Make sure to have a nice
little fuse sticking out of the cement.
That fuse should be a little smaller
than the amount of time it took for
impact. (Smaller time-wise)
Figure that if it took 30 sec. to fall
then the fuse should be enough for
about 25 sec.
Now this is good for a bomb that will
go straight up and come straight
down. Now if you want to shoot it on
an angle, then you must use some
formula to figure out how high the
rocket will be when ejection occurs so
that you can time your fuse right.
Remember to use a no-time delay engine
so that the ejection charge will occur
immediatly.

If you really wanna blow the shit out of some loser, someone
(A friend of mine) told me how to do, I think this is what
     Get a bottle (Glass, any size)
       Buy some ammonia (like the stuff used on floors)
       Get the highest concentration of iodine that you can find.
 
Directions:
         Pour a fuckin hell of a lot of ammonia in bottle. Add all of
   iodine (if possible get at least 95% solution of iodine)
   A lot of white shit will seperate at the bottom. Pour out the liquid
   and then take bottle with shit and knife and spread into and of
   your enemy's tire treads. Put the bottle somewhere in the engine.
   (don't keep it or it'll probably blow up and kill you). Now, The
   phunny shit.
 
        As soon as that shit is dried, whenever you apply the least
     amount of pressure, the shit will blow up!!! HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa!!!
     there probably won't be much left of the fag you do this to!!!!!
