 Things you need:
---------------------------------------------
    Tennis Balls - One For Each Bomb
    Fun Snaps    - 1 Box
    Matches      - 1 Box Wooden
    Duct Tape
    Knife
    Lighter Fluid
    Funnel
---------------------------------------------

  First get the knife and cut about a 1 Inch by 1 Inch cross (hole) in the
tennis ball. Then cut all the heads off the matches and put them in a cup
(there should be enough to fill the inside of the ball). Now take a funnel
and drop two or three fun snaps in the tennis ball, use more if you want.
Now once you have the fun snaps inside,with the funnel still in the tennis
ball, fill the tennis ball with the match heads. 
  [NOTE]: You need the inside very compressed and also be very careful!
          The ball can explode at any bump.

 Now duct tape the whole or slit that you had the funnel in. Now cover the
tennis ball with lighter fluid or Gas! Now you have a pressusre activated
tennis ball. Also you can add Gun Power or Magnesium, or duct tape the
whole damn thing and get a bigger explosion!
