 Grenades:

  #1:  "Barber's Bomb"

     Ingredients:
          Some Gasoline
          A CAN of Shaving Cream
          A Fuse about 6 inches long

   Ok, first look at the Shaving Cream, it should be the aerosole kind..
 Spray all of the Shaving Cream out, or use an empty one. Now look and 
 you should see on the can :the Aerosole plunger you push, and under that a
 red, thin tube. Pull off both of these things. You might need pliers to help
 with the thin tube.
   Now, carefully drip or pour gasoline into the can until it is almost
 full, now slide the fuse thru the little hole, and into the gas.
   You now have a metal can with a little hole in the top, and the can
 is full of gasoline. Slip the fuse thru the hole and into the gas.
   Light the fuse and throw at your favorite friend.
        B    A    N    G    !   !

 #2: Milwaukee Special -- A modification of a Molotov Cocktail...

   Get a glass bottle with a cork and a test tube with a cork.
  Put small holes in each cork, and fill the test tube with Potassium
  Permanganate and the Bottle with gasoline. Cork 'em both up.
   Slip a fuse thru the hole in the Test Tube Cork, so that the fuse
  is touching the Potassium. Uncork the bottle, and put the test tube in the
  bottle, but make sure the fuse doesn't touch the gas. Slip the remainder
  of the fuse thru the glass bottle's cork and out of both, and cork the
  glass bottle. Light and throw..

  You could drop some nails or thumbtacks in the GASOLINE part of the
  bomb to further hurt people.

    Here's a diagram to clear things up:
