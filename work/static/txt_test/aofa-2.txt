    Welcome to file #2, Here's somethings that'll just make you
    laugh out of your set reading.

 
2.0   Get some Jello powder. Buy it in little Square boxes for 30 cents
      a pack, Go to a toilet which you are sure they'll not be used till
      morning, Pour the whole packet in and by the next day it'll be
      hard jello. Really funny because you can flush it down the toilet
      and it's hard to get it out without cloging the toilet.


2.1   Get some Alka-Seltzer and put it in a bird feeder, The birds will
      eat it fly away but it won't digest, It'll start to release major
      gas and then will explode the guts of the bird, Its sick because you
      can see them flying away and then seeing them fall.


2.2  Get a Bullet (Shotgun) Find the end where there's Tin or metal.
     If it in some Solvent Coment. And light it and drop it down. Run
     like Hell, And it'll go bang and possibly shoot out the pellets
     in side, You can try Throwing it but it's rare to work.


2.3   Car Wars, Le'ts trash some cars, Put Sank in the Gas tank, It'll 
      screw the engine and be a expensive price to fix it.

2.4   Find the part where the gas goes in, Mostly on the left side or
      under the Licence plate. Pour Lighter Fluid down it and wait till it
      gets all the way down, About 3 Bottles of Lighter Fluid will be needed.
      Then Ignite the lighter fuild with a match. And it'll burn down the
      tank pipe slowly and will probably blow the engine up, Gas doesn't
      burn that good for a kick up fire so Lighter fluid is better.

2.5   Get a drill and go under the car, Find some pipes, Drill a hole
      though a few pipes, The best is where the gas pipe is, It'll drip
      out and the guy will lose more money when it drips out.

2.6   If the door of the car is opened and you are sure you won't get
      caught, Go in it and trash it good. Get Lighter Fluid and pour it  
      it all over the seats, Dash board, Floor and light it. The car
      is totalled.


2.7   Open the hood. Look at that big fan, Screw it up by cutting the 
      rubber wire which spins when the engines running.


2.8   Pour Sank, Water, Gas, Lighter Fluid, Anything in the Oil tank.

2.9   Un-screw the lights in the back and take out the bulbs. Then put it
      back in, They'll get pulled over for not using there lights and they
      won't know.
