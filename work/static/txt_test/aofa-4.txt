   Welcome to the last of the 4 files, This file is a bit neat.
   Enjoy..


4.0   Free Stuff, Get a pop can, Now when you open a pop can you pull the
      latch and it pushes down on a round part and opens the pop and you 
      drink from that hole which the round thing is, You gatta know what 
      I mean..
      Now put it in those money machines for 10 cents. It'll work, Better
      way to say it, Put those caps in a bubble gun machine foe 10 cents
      and it'll work.

4.1   Tip over those big pop machines and lift it back up and drop it again,
      or have two or three people shake it really well. The pop will fall
      out.

4.2   Find those paper boxes, Hold the handle part and push in while pushing
      to the side, It'll open the paper boxes.


4.3   To open dudly locks, You can have one free simple chance of doing it, 
      sometimes it'll work. Lift the lock in the 90 angle and pull.
      Sometimes it always works.


4.4  Drill a hole in a quarter at the very corner, Then put string though
     it and drop it in. But don't let it in all the way, Slowly lower the
     quarter in the arcade box untill you see you credit simbol rise, Then 
     jerk it around the spot and you'll get major credits.

4.5  Back to bubble Gun Machines, Put glue around a quarter and put it in
     the slot, Let it go hard with in a minutes and turn it, The coin will
     allow the food to come out and keep spinning it around and more food
     will come out. 

4.6  Get a fire Extingruiser. I forgot how to spell it, Anyways, It's 
     an excellent thing for Escaping places, Best in an Alley, Have 
     a medium size, They'll fit in you coat and won't show to much.
     If some on is chasing you and you plan to turn left though you could
     go right, Pull the thingy out and spray it about 10 feet way from you, 
     It'll cause a Huge smoke cloud, The fag chasing you won't run though
     it. So you have Escaped, This is still fun, You have have fun spraying
     at cars, It's also fun to spray it at birds. Also get a flare and ignite
     it, Point the burning flare at the fire thingy, It'll explode and make
     a fucking great smoke screen.
