THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY TECHNICAL MANUAL
"IMPROVISED MUNITIONS HANDBOOK".  THE BOOK ORIGINALLY CAME WITH PICTURES,
BUT I WILL JUST TYPE UP THE STEPS, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO IMPROVISE ON WHAT
IT WILL LOOK LIKE (AS IF IT REALLY MATTERED).  I DON'T SUGGEST DOING
THEM, (DISCLAIMER, EH?) BUT I'M TELLING YOU HOW TO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW.  HAVE PHUN.

THE ROUND STICK OVER CRYSTALS TO CRUSH INTO A VERY FINE POWDER UNTIL IT
LOOKS LIKE FACE POWDER OR WHEAT FLOUR.
2.  PLACE 9 PARTS POWDERED POTASSUIM CHLORATE AND 1 PART PETROLEUM
JELLY IN A WIDE BOWL OR SIMILAR CONTAINER.  MIX INGREDIENTS WITH HANDS
(KNEAD) UNTIL A UNIFORM PASTE IS OBTAINED.


************NOTE**********STORE EXPLOSIVE IN A WATERPROOF CONTAINER
UNTIL READY FOR USE!!!!


POTASSIUM NITRATE
-----------------
POTASSIUM NITRATE (SALTPETER) CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM MANY NATURAL
SOURCES AND CAN BE USED TO MAKE NITRIC ACID, BLACK POWDER, AND MANY
PYROTECHNICS.  THE YIELD RANGES FROM .1 TO 10% BY WEIGHT, DEPENDING ON
THE FERTILITY OF THE SOIL.

MATERIALS                              SOURCE
---------                              ------
NITRATE BEARING EARTH OR OTHER         SOIL CONTAINING OLD DECAYED VEGETABLE
MATERIAL, ABOUT 3-1/2 GALLONS          OR ANIMAL MATTER;
(13-1/2 LITERS).                       OLD CELLARS AND/OR FARM DIRT FLOORS;
                                       EARTH FROM OLD BURIAL GROUNDS;
                                       DECAYED STONE OR MORTAR BUILDING
                                       FOUNDATIONS
FINE WOOD ASHES, ABOUT 1/2 CUP         TOTALLY BURNED WHITISH WOOD ASH POWDER
(1/8 LITER).                           TOTALLY BURNED PAPER (BLACK)
BUCKET OR SIMILAR CONTAINER, ABOUT
5 GALLONS (19 LITERS) IN VOLUME
(PLASTIC, METAL, OR WOOD).
2 PIECES OF FINELY WOVEN CLOTH,
EACH SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN BOTTOM OF
BUCKET.
SHALLOW PAN OR DISH, AT LEAST AS
LARGE AS BOTTOM OF BUCKET.
SHALLOW HEAT RESISTANT CONTAINER
(CERAMIC, METAL, ETC.).
WATER - 1-3/4 GALLONS (6-3/4 LITERS)
AWL, KNIFE, SCREWDRIVER, OR OTHER
HOLE PRODUCING INSTRUMENT.
ALCOHOL ABOUT 1 GALLON (4 LITERS)
(WHISKEY, RUBBING ALCOHOL, ETC.).
HEAT SOURCE (FIRE, ELECTRIC HEATER, ETC.).
PAPER.
TAPE.

***********NOTE: ONLY THE RATIOS OF THE AMOUNTS OF INGREDIENTS ARE IMPORTANT.
           THUS, FOR TWICE AS MUCH POTASSIUM NITRATE, DOUBLE QUANTITIES USED.

PROCEDURE
---------
1. PUNCH HOLES IN BOTTOM OF BUCKET.  SPREAD ONE PIECE OF CLOTH INSIDE OF BUCKET.
2. PLACE WOOD ASHES ON CLOTH AND SPREAD TO MAKE A LAYER ABOUT THE THICKNESS OF
   THE CLOTH.  PLACE SECOND PIECE OF CLOTH ON TOP OF ASHES.
3. PLACE DIRT IN BUCKET.
4. PLACE BUCKET OVER SHALLOW CONTAINER.  BUCKET MAY BE SUPPORTED ON STICKS IF
   NECESSARY.
5. BOIL WATER AND POUR IT OVER EARTH IN BUCKET A LITTLE AT A TIME.  ALLOW
   WATER TO RUN THROUGH HOLES IN BUCKET INTO SHALLOW CONTAINER.  BE SURE WATER
   GOES THROUGH *ALL* OF THE EARTH.  ALLOW DRAINED LIQUID TO COOL AND SETTLE
   FOR 1 TO 2 HOURS.

************NOTE: DO NOT POUR ALL OF THE WATER AT ONCE, SINCE THIS MAY CAUSE
                  STOPPAGE.

6. CAREFULLY DRAIN OFF LIQUID INTO HEAT RESISTANT CONTAINER.  DISCARD ANY
   SLUDGE REMAINING IN BOTTOM OF THE SHALLOW CONTAINER.
7. BOIL MIXTURE OVER HOT FIRE FOR AT LEAST 2 HOURS.  SMALL GRAINS OF SALT WILL
   BEGIN TO APPEAR IN THE SOLUTION.  SCOOP THESE OUT AS THEY FORM, USING ANY
   TYPE OF IMPROVISED STRAINER (PAPER, ETC.).
8. WHEN LIQUID HAS BOILED DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY HALF ITS ORIGINAL VOLUME, REMOVE
   FROM FIRE AND LET SIT.  AFTER HALF AN HOUR ADD AN EQUAL VOLUME OF ALCOHOL.
   WHEN MIXTURE IS POURED THROUGH PAPER, SMALL WHITE CRYSTALS WILL COLLECT ON
   TOP OF IT.
9. TO PURIFY THE POTASSUIM NITRATE, RE-DESOLVE THE DRY CRYSTALS IN THE SMALLEST
   POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF BOILED WATER.  REMOVE ANY SALT CRYSTALS THAT APPEAR (STEP
   7); POUR THROUGH AN IMPROVISED FILTER MADE OF SEVERAL PIECES OF PAPER AND
   EVAPORATE OR GENTLY HEAT THE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION TO DRYNESS.
10.SPREAD CRYSTALS ON FLAT SURFACE AND ALLOW TO DRY.  THE POTASSIUM NITRATE
   CRYSTALS ARE NOW READY FOR USE.

IMPROVISED BLACK POWDER
-----------------------
BLACK POWDER CAN BE PREPARED IN A SIMPLE, SAFE MANNER.  IT MAY BE USED AS
BLASTING OR GUN POWDER.

MATERIALS REQUIRED
------------------
POTASSIUM NITRATE, GRANULATED, 3 CUPS (3/4 LITER)
WOOD CHARCOAL, POWDERED, 2 CUPS (1/2 LITER)
SULFER, POWDERED, 1/2 CUP (1/8 LITER)
ALCOHOL, 5 PINTS (2-1/2 LITERS) (WHISKEY, RUBBING ALCOHOL, ETC.)
WATER, 3 CUPS (3/4 LITER)
HEAT SOURCE
2 BUCKETS-EACH 2 GALLON (7-1/2 LITERS) CAPACITY, AT LEAST ONE OF WHICH IS HEAT
          RESISTANT (METAL, CERAMIC, ETC.)
FLAT WINDOW SCREENING, AT LEAST 1 FOOT (30 CM) SQUARE
LARGE WOODEN STICK
CLOTH, AT LEAST 2 FEET (60 CM) SQUARE

PROCEDURE
---------
1. PLACE ALCOHOL IN ONE OF THE BUCKETS.
2. PLACE POTASSIUM NITRATE, CHARCOAL, AND SULFER IN THE HEAT RESISTANT BUCKET.
   ADD 1 CUP WATER AND MIX THOROUGHLY WITH WOODEN STICK UNTIL ALL INGREDIENTS
   ARE DISSOLVED.
3. ADD REMAINING WATER (2 CUPS) TO MIXTURE.  PLACE BUCKET ON HEAT SOURCE AND
   STIR UNTIL SMALL BUBBLES BEGIN TO FORM.

**********CAUTION: DO NOT BOIL MIXTURE.  BE SURE *ALL* MIXTURE STAYS WET.  IF
                   ANY IS DRY, AS ON SIDES OF PAN, IT MAY IGNITE.

4. REMOVE BUCKET FROM HEAT AND POUR MIXTURE INTO ALCOHOL WHILE STIRRING
   VIGOROUSLY.
5. LET ALCOHOL MIXTURE STAND ABOUT 5 MINUTES.  STRAIN MIXTURE THROUGH CLOTH TO
   OBTAIN BLACK POWDER.  DISCARD LIQUID.  WRAP CLOTH AROUND BLACK POWDER AND
   SQUEEZE TO REMOVE ALL EXCESS LIQUID.
6. PLACE SCREENING OVER DRY BUCKET.  PLACE WORKABLE AMOUNT OF DAMP POWDER ON
   SCREEN AND GRANULATE BY RUBBING SOLID THROUGH SCREEN.

**********NOTE: IF GRANULATED PARTICLES APPEAR TO STICK TOGETHER AND CHANGE
                SHAPE, RECOMBINE ENTIRE BATCH OF POWDER AND REPEAT STEPS 5 & 6.

7. SPREAD GRANULATED BLACK POWDER ON FLAT DRY SURFACE SO THAT LAYER ABOUT 1/2
   INCH (1-1/4 CM) IS FORMED.  ALLOW TO DRY.  USE RADIATOR, OR DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
   THIS SHOULD BE DRIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY IN ONE HOUR.  THE LONGER
   THE DRYING PERIOD, THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE BLACK POWDER.

***************CAUTION: REMOVE FROM HEAT *AS SOON AS* GRANULES ARE DRY.  BLACK
                        POWDER IS NOW READY FOR USE.

NITRIC ACID
-----------
NITRIC ACID IS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF MANY EXPLOSIVES, INCENDIARY MIXTURES,
AND ACID DELAY TIMERS.  IT MAY BE PREPARED BY DISTILLING A MIXTURE OF POTASSIUM
NITRATE AND CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID.

MATERIALS REQUIRED                     SOURCES
------------------                     -------
POTASSIUM NITRATE (2 PARTS BY VOLUME)  DRUG STORE
                                       IMPROVISED
*CONCENTRATED* SULFURIC ACID (1 PART   MOTOR VEHICLE BATTERIES
BY VOLUME)                             INDUSTRIAL PLANTS
2 BOTTLES OR CERAMIC JUGS (NARROW
  NECKS ARE PREFERABLE)
POT OR FRYING PAN
HEAT SOURCE (WOOD, COAL, OR CHARCOAL)
TAPE (PAPER, ELECTRICAL, MASKING, ETC.
      BUT *NOT* CELLOPHANE)
PAPER OR RAGS

*********IMPORTANT: IF SULFURIC ACID IS OBTAINED FROM A MOTOR VEHICLE BATTERY,
                    CONCENTRATE IT BY BOILING IT *UNTIL* WHITE FUMES APPEAR.
                    ******DO NOT INHALE FUMES!!!******

*********NOTE: THE AMOUNT OF NITRIC ACID PRODUCED IS THE SAME AS THE AMOUNT OF
               POTASSIUM NITRATE.  THUS, FOR 2 TABLESPOONSFUL OF NITRIC ACID,
               USE 2 TABLESPOONSFUL OF POTASSIUM NITRATE AND 1 TABLESPOONFUL OF
               CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID.

PROCEDURE
---------
1. PLACE DRY POTASSIUM NITRATE IN BOTTLE OR JUG.  ADD SULFURIC ACID.  DO NOT
   FILL BOTTLES MORE THAN 1/4 FULL.  MIX UNTIL PASTE IS FORMED.

*********CAUTION: SULFURIC ACID WILL BURN SKIN AND DESTROY CLOTHING.  IF ANY IS
                  SPILLED, WASH IT AWAY WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER.  FUMES
                  ARE ALSO DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NOT BE INHALED

2. WRAP PAPER OR RAGS AROUND NECKS OF 2 BOTTLES.  SECURELY TAPE NECKS OF BOTTLES
   TOGETHER.  BE SURE BOTTLES ARE FLUSH AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THAT THERE ARE NO
   AIR SPACES.
3. SUPPORT BOTTLES ON ROCKS OR CANS SO THAT EMPTY BOTTLE IS *SLIGHTLY* LOWER
   THAN BOTTLE CONTAINING PASTE SO THAT NITRIC ACID THAT IS FORMED IN RECEIVING
   BOTTLE WILL NOT RUN INTO OTHER BOTTLE.
4. BUILD FIRE IN POT OR FRYING PAN.
5. GENTLY HEAT BOTTLE CONTAINING MIXTURE BY MOVING FIRE IN AND OUT.  AS RED
   FUMES BEGIN TO APPEAR PERIODICALLY POUR COOL WATER OVER EMPTY RECEIVING
   BOTTLE.  NITRIC ACID WILL BEGIN TO FORM IN THE RECEIVING BOTTLE.

*********CAUTION: DO NOT OVERHEAT OR WET BOTTLE CONTAINING MIXTURE OR IT MAY
                  SHATTER.  AS AN ADDED PRECAUTION, PLACE BOTTLE TO BE HEADED IN
                  HEAT RESISTANT CONTAINER FILLED WITH SAND OR GRAVEL.  HEAT
                  THIS OUTER CONTAINER TO PRODUCE NITRIC ACID.

6. CONTINUE THE ABOVE PROCESS UNTIL NO MORE RED FUMES ARE FORMED.  IF THE NITRIC
   ACID FORMED IN THE RECEIVING BOTTLE IS NOT CLEAR (CLOUDY) POUR IT INTO
   CLEANED BOTTLE AND REPEAT STEPS 2-6.

**********CAUTION: NITRIC ACID WILL BURN SKIN AND DESTROY CLOTHING.  IF ANY IS
                   SPILLED, WASH IT AWAY WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER.  FUMES
                   ARE ALSO DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NOT BE INHALED.

                   NITRIC ACID SHOULD BE KEPT AWAY FROM ALL COMBUSTABLES AND
                   SHOULD BE KEPT IN A *SEALED CERAMIC OR GLASS* CONTAINER.

INITIATOR FOR DUST EXPLOSIONS
-----------------------------
AN INITIATOR WHICH WILL INITIATE COMMON MATERIAL TO PRODUCE DUST EXPLOSIONS CAN
BE RAPIDLY AND EASILY CONSTRUCTED.  THIS TYPE OF CHARGE IS IDEAL FOR THE
DESTRUCTION OF ENCLOSED AREAS SUCH AS ROOMS OR BUILDINGS.

MATERIALS REQUIRED:
-------------------
A FLAT CAN, 3 IN. (8 CM) DIAMETER AND 1-1/2 IN. (3 3/4 CM) HIGH.  A 6-1/2 OUNCE
  TUNA CAN SERVES THE PURPOSE QUITE WELL.
BLASTING CAP
EXPLOSIVE
ALUMINUM (MAY BE WIRE, CUT SHEET, FLATTENED CAN, OR POWDER)
LARGE NAIL, 4 IN. (10 CM) LONG
WOODEN ROD - 1/4 IN. (6 MM) DIAMETER
FLOUR, GASOLINE, AND POWDER OR CHIPPED ALUMINUM

***NOTE***: PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES (COMP. C-4, ETC) PRODUCE BETTER EXPLOSIONS THAN
            CAST EXPLOSIVES (COMP. B, ETC)

PROCEDURE:
----------
1.  USING THE NAIL, PRESS A HOLE THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE TUNA CAN 3/8 TO 1/2
    INCH (1 TO 1-1/2 CM) FROM THE BOTTOM.  USING A ROTATING AND LEVER ACTION,
    EMLARGE THE HOLE UNTIL IT WILL ACCOMMODATE THE BLASTING CAP.

2.  PLACE THE WOODEN ROD IN THE HOLE AND POSITION THE END OF THE ROD AT THE
    CENTER OF THE CAN.

3.  PRESS EXPLOSIVE INTO THE CAN, BEING SURE TO SURROUND THE ROD, UNTIL IT IS
    3/4 INCH (2 CM) FROM THE TOP OF THE CAN.  CAREFULLY REMOVE THE WOODEN ROD.

4.  PLACE THE ALUMINUM METAL ON TOP OF THE EXPLOSIVE.

5.  JUST BEFORE USE, INSERT THE BLASTING CAP INTO THE CAVITY MADE BY THE ROD.
    THE INITIATOR IS NOW READY FOR USE.

***NOTE***: IF IT IS DESIRED TO CARRY THE INITIATOR SOME DISTANCE, CARDBOARD
            MAY BE PRESSED ON TOP OF THE ALUMINUM TO INSURE AGAINST LOSS OF
            MATERIAL.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
THIS PARTICULAR UNIT WORKS QUITE WELL TO INITIATE CHARGES OF FIVE POUNDS OF
FLOUR, 1/2 GALLON (1-2/3 LITERS) OF GASOLINE OF TWO POUNDS OF FLAKE PAINTERS
ALUMINUM.  THE SOLID MATERIALS MAY MERELY BE CONTAINED IN SACKS OR CARDBOARD
CARTONS.  THE GASOLINE MAY BE PLACED IN PLASTIC-COATED PAPER MILK CARTONS,
PLASTIC OR GLASS BOTTLES.  THE CHARGES ARE PLACED DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE
INITIATOR AND THE BLASTING CAP IS ACTUATED ELECTRICALLY OR BY FUSE DEPENDING ON
THE TYPE OF CAP EMPLOYED.  THIS WILL DESTROY A 2000 CUBIC FEET ENCLUSURE
(BUILDING 10 X 20 X 10 FEET).

***NOTE***: FOR LARGER ENCLOSURES, USE A PROPORTIONATELY LARGER INITIATORS AND
            CHARGES.
