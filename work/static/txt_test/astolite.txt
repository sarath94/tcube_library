Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck! Go ahead!
I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for enlightening purposes
only'! I would love it if everyone made a gallon of astrolite and blew their
fucken school to kingdom scum!

Astrolite
---------

The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant
research in the '60's. Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's most
powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than TNT.
Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT (not that it isn't safe
in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.

Astrolite G
-----------

"Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very
high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 7,700MPS for
nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual characteristic
is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be absorbed easily into the
ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite G has remained
detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even when the soil was soaked due to
rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite!

To make (mix in fairly large container & outside)
-------

Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight
'anhydrous' hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that
the 2:1 ratio is not perfect,and that if you screw around with it long enough,
that you'll find a better formula. Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous'
hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...

Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting hold
of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals (maleic hydra-
zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization catalyst,
plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, photographic developers,
diving equipment. Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be careful with.

Astrolite A/A-1-5
------------------

Ok, here's the good part...

Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with
hydrazine. The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer. Astrolite A has a
detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.

Misc. info
----------

You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you,if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water. Astrolite A&G both should be able
to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.


Sodium Chlorate Formulas
------------------------

Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute. Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water. You can find sodium
chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store. It is used in
blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder
-------------------------

65% sodium chlorate
22% charcoal
13% sulfur
and sprinkle some graphite on top.

Rocket Fuel
-----------

6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)
----------------------------------

50% sodium chlorate
35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' (tm))
10% epoxy resin hardener
5%  sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

Incendiary Mixture
------------------

55% aluminum powder (atomized)
45% sodium chlorate
5%  sulfur

Impact Mixture
--------------

50% red phosphorus
50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when mix-
ed with phosphorus. It has to be hit to be detonated.

Filler explosive
----------------

85% sodium chlorate
10% vaseline
5% aluminum powder

Nitromethane formulas
---------------------

I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

Nitromethane (CH3NO2)
specific gravity:1.139
flash point:95f
auto-ignite:785f

Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.

Uses: Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes, fats,
      etc.
To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine
2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT. Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

Nitromethane 'solid' explosives
-------------------------------

2 parts nitromethane
5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min. when done,store in an air-tight container.
This is supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-
glycerin, and has 30% more brilliance.



A few questions:

1) Does anyone know how to make 'knockout gases'?
2) What's on the handkerchief you see people in the movies use to knockout
   people?
3) Does the formula for chloral hydrate in 'Poor Man's James Bond' work?
   Normally chloral hydrate is 1:5, chloral to water..but in PMJB it's 1:2.
   Also, what's the calcium oxide for?

ps- Kurt Saxon doesn't know shit about drugs!
