Here is another handy device for you
terrorist peoples out there...
 
MATERIALS:
----------
2 CUPS : HYDROCHLORIC ACID (OR 4 CUPS
         MYURATIC POOL ACID)
1 CUP  : POOL CHLORINE, (OR ONE LARGE
         CHLORINE TABLET
TWO GLASS BOTTLES WITH CAPS, ONE OF
WHICH IS SMALLER, AND CAN FIT INSIDE
THE OTHER.
 
CONSTRUCTION:
-------------
Fill the smaller bottle with acid.
Screw on the cap. Make sure no acid is
leaking out or if any is remaining
around the cap or such, wipe it off.
 
Place the smaller bottle into the larger bottle and fill the chlorine in
around it, then place the cap on that
bottle.
 
USE:
----
 
Throw this handy container into a
crowd, or at any other target. Usually
it wont kill people (unless you hit the
person with the heavy bottle in the
head!) It is VERY successful in
blinding people (at least temporarily.)
 
The more of each substance used, the
larger the cloud.
 
-----------
also:::  anyone who read my car bomb
kit file...  DO NOT USE DU-PONT 
IMR-4227. IT IS MUCH TOO FAST! It burns itself out. Use a slower, rifle
powder, or use pyrodex, or straight
black powder. The pyrodex is the same
as black powder, but is less prone to
accidental ignition.

      This explosive can not only be used as an explosive, but also as a
detonater.  I will go into this one very detailed and all my following articles
will be the same.

                                                       appear.

Eye Dropper or Syringe w/ glass tube

Large Pan

Ice and Salt

Water

Paper Towels

All the above can easily be commandeered from your school laboratory for your
own purposes.

-=-=-=-=-=-
-PROCEDURE-
-=-=-=-=-=-

1)  Mix 30 ml of Acetone and 50ml of Hydrogen Peroxide into a glass container
    and mix thoroughly.

2)  Cool it by plaicing it in a larger container containing ice, salt, and
    water.  Now cool it to 5 degrees Celcius.

3)  Add 2.5 ml of concentrated ulfuric acid to the mixture slowly (drop by
    drop w/ the eye dropper).  Stir the mixture w/the thermometer keeping the
    the temperature between 5-10 degrees celcius.  If the temperature rises
    don't shit just stop adding the sulfuric acid until it cools down then
    start adding it again.

4)  Now that you got all the acid into the mixture continue stirring for
    another 5 minutes.

5)  Now let the mixture stand for 12 to 24 hours in the ice/salt bath.

6)  After 12 hours the crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of the
    once clear solution.  Precipitation should be done after 24 hours.

7)  Now filter out the crystals through a paper towel attached to a jar with a
    rubber band.  Then after that wash the crystals by pouring ice cold water
    over them, letting the water rinse the crystals and filter down through the
    paper towel into the jar.

8)  Select a container and allow them to dry.

    Now this can be used as an explosive however it is the simplest detonater
that I have ever encountered.  It works best in 2.5 inch lengths of brass
tubing with one end sealed.  The only drawback is that it must be used quickly
as Acetone Peroxide deteriorates quickly.  I have found that keeping it
refrigerated seems to make it last longer however for optimum effects it
should be used 7 days after manufacture at the latest.  It also can be used
to detonate almost every Ammonium Nitrate compound, and Ammonium Nitrate
itself for that matter.

      This one is a killer it is more powerful and more brisant than C-4.
However you need a blasting cap to detonate or a homemade compound detonater.
Namely Acetone Peroxide detonaters can be used here or Mini-Compound
Detonaters.

*NOTE* mixing these two is the same as baking soda and vinegar so the reaction
is very effervescant and can bubble over the top so use a jar 6 times the
volume of the Hydrazine!  Also large volumes of ammonia gas are realeased when
these two are mixed so wear a gas mask or be upwind of the mixing.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


1)  Pour into the container the an amount of Anhyrdrous Hydrazine equal to the
    amount of explosive required.

2)  Ammonium Nitrate Prilled or Powdered is added a teaspoon at a time to the
    container, then wait for it to dissolve (stirring constantly), and then add
    more.

3)  Continue the above process until the ammonium nitrate no longer dissolves
    into the hydrazine, and don't worry about the small amount of ammonium
    nitrate left over.

4)  Now your basically done and you have an explosive more powerful than any
    military explosive.

5)  To make it more powerful add 20% aluminum powder to the mixture (100 mesh
    or finer)

    This mixture has unique absorbtion and retention properties, and can be
poured directly on the ground for a liquid land mine.  This type of land mine
is totally disquised and cannot be noticed, and all you need to do is bury a
compound detonater in the ground, which can be detonated by a step switch etc.
This type of land mine remains detonatable for up to four days regardless of
rain etc...  It can also be poured into a container and used as a bomb.

Several large quart canning jars

Two large basins or bowls made of metal or
some other heatable metal

Paper Towels


-=-=-=-=-=-
-PROCEDURE-
-=-=-=-=-=-


1)  Place one half cup or 120 ml or cc of nitric acid in a large canning jar
    and bring the temperature to between 20 and 30 degrees celcius (68-86 F)
    by putting the jar in a basin of cold water.

2)  Keep the thermometer in the jar so you can closely maintain the temperature
    between your basins of hot and cold water.

3)  Weigh out 70 grams by weight or 18 teaspoons by volume of hexamine.  Then
    start adding the hexamin slowly at 1/2 teaspoon at a time over a 15 minute
    time period.  All the while maintaining the temperature between 20 and 30
    degrees celcius by moving it in and out of the cold water basins.

4)  When all the hexamin is dissolved in the acid heat the solution to 55
    degrees celcius (131 F) by placing the jar in a basin of hot water.  Then
    maintain this temperature for about ten minutes.

5)  Now remove the jar from the basin of hot water and place it in the basin
    of cold water and cool the jar to 20 degrees celcius (68 F).  Now when the
    solution reaches 20 degrees celcius add 3 cups (750ml) of cold water and
    white salt will appear.

6)  Now the white salt is RDX and should be handled with care.  Now filter the
    Acid/Water/RDX solution through a paper towel covering the mouth of another
    jar.

7)  Wash the RDX crystals off the paper towel and add an additional 3 cups of
    fresh cold water and a teaspoon of sodium carbonate to neutralize the acid.
    Now stir rapidly for 3 minutes and then filter it out again.

8)  It is now usable, but I prefer purifying it by filling a quart canning jar
    2/3 full of acetone and heating the acetone then adding the RDX crystals to
    it a half teaspoon at a time until it completely dissolves in the acetone.

9)  Now that it is all dissolved let the solution cool to room temperature and
    let it stand for one hour.  The RDX will then precipitate again into it's
    salt.   Then you must filter it through a paper towel around anothr jar and
    rinse it with cold water the same way you did before.  Now you have the
    finished product roguhly 1 and 1/2 ounces of RDX.

10) Now store your finished product (after it dries) in a jar with a air tight
    lid for future use.  Seeing that RDX does not lose it's effectiveness for
    months.

     RDX is a very powerful explosive however it can be compressed into tubes
to make detonaters.  Later in this newsletter I will prescribe a method for
making detonaters in which RDX will be used along with other explosives before
mentioned.  RDX however is sensitive to friction, and can be used as an
explosive by itself.  It is also commonly refered to as Clyclonite.

        This is basically a tutorial in making detonaters, and there are a
few rules, that I would like each and every one of you to follow.  Making
detonaters is very very dangerous considering that the purpose of detonaters
is for them to be sensitive and easily detonated, so be careful.  Also the
detonaters I am telling you how to make are small, but the same principle can
be applied on a larger scale.

A loading press (commonly used for reloading shells     Gun stores
also please be safe considering a few of these
detonaters may detonate when being compressed, so
take the neccessary precautions such as safty glasses
etc...)


-=-=-=-=-=-
-PROCEDURE-
-=-=-=-=-=-

*NOTE* dirt or oil may sensitive the detonaters to an unsafe level so when
handling the primary ad secondary and ingnition charges use tongs.  Also boil
a bucket of water in the room as humidity helps or if your in a house turn
your shower on hot and leave it on!

1)      Now light a candle, and let two drops of wax drip into each shell
        casing before use.  Then let the wax cool down.

2)      Now fill the casing to a depth of 1/4 inch with RDX or PETN, and then
        *GENTLY and SLOWLY* insert the ram and compress the explosive slowly
        and evenly.  Now remove the ram slowly and carefully.

3)      Continue this process adding small amounts of RDX or PETN until a
        column of secondary explosive 5/8 of an inch high has been pressed into
        the 1 inch shell casing.

4)      Now add a small amount of Primary explosive the same way you added the
        secondary explosive on top of the secondary explosive.  Now add the
        Mercury Fulminate or Acetone Peroxide on top of the 5/8 inch column of
        secondary explosive and compress it with the ram until it reaches a
        height of primary explosive 1/4 inch high.

5)      Now compress the remaining 1/8 of an inch with black powder.  Now seal
        the top with wax paper or tape until ready for use.

        These little beauties can be used for almost any purpose or a larger
version can be used where a hard to detonate substance is used.  Their main
use is for minature hand grenades and other small explosives.  The next issue
of "Anarchy Today" will cover various things such as explosive candles, etc...

     This ignitor is one of my many favorites, it can be ignited by either
concentrated sulfuric or nitric acids.  It also works excellently as a time
delay, which I will detail later.

1)      Spread handful at a time the potassium chlorate on the large board and
        rub with the other flatboard or a rolling pin until the particles
        resemble granulated sugar.

2)      Now measure out 2 parts by volume of sugar into the container, and then
        add 3 parts by volume of the Potassium Chlorate to the container.  Now
        recap the container and shake the mixture for 4-5 minutes until it has
        a uniform color and consistency.

3)      Store for future use in an air tight container, but remember to shake
        it up before use to re-mix any settled particles.

        Now for a delayed reaction place the acid in a gelatin capsule and
bury the gelatin capsule in the Potassium Chlorate mixture.  Depending on how
many gelatin capsules you use and their size depends on the delay.  It can
range from 20 minutes to and hour or more.  This type of ignitor reaches a
temperature of 3,200 degrees farenheit and can ignite most incendiaries.  It
can also be compacted into a pipe to create a low power pipe bomb.

        This is more of a secondary ignitor for those tough to ignite
incendiaries such as thermite etc...  It is relatively easy to make and safe
to handle so therefore it is an excellent ignitor, and it does not lose it's
effectiveness quickly.

        by closing the lid and shaking it up for 4-5 minutes until a uniform
        color and consistancy are achieved.

3)      Store the igniter in a waterproof container until ready for use.  Also
        re-shake before use to re-mix and settled particles.

        This is mainly used to ignite thermite.  Four spoonfuls of this
aluminum/sulfur igniter are added on top of the thermite, and one spoonful of
potassium chlorate/sugar igniter is added on top of that.  Now when the
potassium Chlorate/sugar igniter is ignited it in turn ignites the
aluminum/sulfur igniter.  This igniter reaches an incredible heat, and should
not be watched igniting without dark lensed protective eyewear, as it may
cause blindness.

1)      Take your two cans and remove the contents, and then wash them out
        thouroughly.  Now drill or puncture a small hole in the bottom center
        of one of the cans.

2)      Now drill or puncture a series of small holes evenly spaced in the side
        of the other can, and cover them with tape.

3)      Now tape the top can (the can with one hole) on top of the other can
        (the one with a lot of holes taped over)

4)      Now place this set up in the center of a pile of Calcium Hypochlorite.
        Now Depending on the delay time required remove the tape from over the
        appropriate number of holes.

5)      To start the delay just add brake fluid to the top can and let it start
        to drip down.

        Please note that the detonating capsules used here will be refered to
most likely in a later issue, because they work excellently.  Also this bomb
disperses flaming oil and gasoline quickly, so steer clear of it when it goes
off.

-PROCEDURE-

1)      Empty out the contents of the gelatin capsules if any and separate
        them.  Now fill the smaller half of the capsule 1/4 full of lead shot.
        Now fill the remaining space with the potassium chlorate/sugar igniter.

2)      Now pack it down, and place the larger end cap on the packed
        main capsule.  Now set this aside for later use.  Now repeat this
        process until a number of capsules have been produced.

3)      Store in a airtight container for future use.

1)      Now your ready to make the incendiary device.  Fill your wine bottle
        about 1/4 inch high with Sulfuric Acid, and then fill the remaining
        space 3/4 full of a gasoline/oil mixture in a 1:1 ratio or half gas
        and half oil (same thing).

2)      Now to detonate drop in three or four of the previously prepared
        capsules, and turn the bottle upside down. (The neck of the bottle
        downward)

3)      What this does is the capsules with the lead shot in them sink to the
        neck of the bottle where the heavier Sulfuric Acid is concentrated.
        Now in about 20 minutes the acid will eat through the capsules and a
        white hot flame will explode the bottle dispersing the gasoline and oil
        mixture.

4)      For a prolonged time delay place the capsule inside a larger capsule.

        This is devasting and should be used in malls or other heavily
trafficked areas.  It has a kill range of 50 yards (half a football feild),
and is one of the best I have seen, and it's fun to watch too!

top half bevelled

Flat board 36x36 and another flat board or
Rolling Pin


-=-=-=-=-=-
-PROCEDURE-
-=-=-=-=-=-


1)      First off crush the Potassium Chlorate between the two boards or with
        the rolling pin until it is a very very very fine powder.

2)      Fill the top half of the soap dish to a depth of 3/4 inch with 1/4 inch
        diameter ball bearings held together with a light coating of epoxy
        resin.

3)      Now cut a hole in the bottom half and cover it with tape.  The hole
        should be big enough for you to pour the nitrobenzene into later and
        big enough to fit a detonater into.

4)      Now pack the bottom half tightly with Potassium Chlorate, very tightly
        leaving no extra room.

5)      Now tape the two halves together tightly, and your pretty much done.


-=-=-=-
-USES!-
-=-=-=-

1)      When your ready to use your charge simply pour in the nitrobenzene.
        The correct ratio is 1 part by volume of nitrobenzene to 4 parts
        by volume of potassium chlorate.  Now if you didn't read this through
        and keep track of the amount of potassium chlorate you used, then you
        fucked up and won't get optimum results.

2)      Now allow the nitrobenzene to soak in for 4-6 minutes, and then insert
        your electronically initiated or time fused detonater into the hole.
        Now seal around the hole with epoxy resin

3)      Now use the magnets and the tape to attach the charge 3 feet above the
        ground with the ball bearing side facing outward.

4)      Now you can either use an egg timer or a stepswitch (Underground
        detonater activated by weight) or you can use the good old time fuse
        running into a mini-compound detonater.

-PROCEDURE-
-=-=-=-=-=-


1)      Cut open or open up the front end of a 12 gauge shotgun shell, and
        empty out the entire contents saving only the casing.

2)      To ensure the mini detonater is centered use the hacksaw to cut a 1/2'
        length of 11/16' steel bar or wooden dowel.  Now drill a 1/4' diameter
        hole in the center of the 1/2' long wood or metal cylinder.

3)      After the guide has been prepared then glue it in place on the primer
        inside the shotgun shell casing.  *NOTE* do not get any glue on the
        primer itself.  Now place the minicompound detonater open side down in
        the cylinder and glue it into place.  Now fill the remaining space in
        the shotshell with Potassium Chlorate ***CAREFULLY***.  Now close off
        the end with tape, and when ready to use simply pour in the
        nitrobenzen activator.

4)      After this is accomplished tape a 3/8' steel ball bearing over the
        primer on the outside of the shell over the primer.  Now tape the
        cloth streamers around the upside of the shell casing to ensure
        stability in flight and also helping it to land on the downside or
        primer side.

5)      Now tape nails around the shell with notches filed 1/4' apart all
        along them.

1)      Pour the nitrobenzene into the upside of the shell and then wait 3-4
        minutes.  Then to use simply throw at a target or group of people and
        upon impact the grenade will detonate itself.

2)      To use as a booby trap simply place it with the ball bearing side up
        in the ground where someone will step on it.  Minus the cloth streamers
        or simply make the shell look the way it was before, and some poor
