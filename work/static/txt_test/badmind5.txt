			   Mace
			==========

	Mace is a red spray that if you get it in you eyes. You'll be
	blinded. This is banned in Canada but not in the states so you
	can probably by it cheaper then making it. Anyways to produce the
	same chemical used in the really mace  will be to expensive make
	or buy so here's some easy recipes from house hold chemicals.

	     Iodine + Salt + Alchohol
	     Glycerine + Vinegar                        
	     
	To make it spray well, Get those hair spray cans which allow you
	to put in your own liquid in.And put it in them, They work excellent.

			   Poison Gas
			================


	Get Solvent cement and open it in a room. The gas will push people
	away. This isn't that get unless you have a good use for it.
	Also, The odor gas from the cement will ignite from a fire. Very
	neat if you open the can near a fireplace.
	There are many other poison gasses. One excellent poison gas is
	carbon dioxide. Not the dangerous but hurt a lungs good.
	Here's a few other gasses.

	Monoxide - Laughing Gas
	Hydrogen - Explodes if ignited
	

       
     

			==================
			   Balloon Bomb
			==================


	A simple balloon explosive is a balloon filled with hydrogen.
	To obtain hydrogen you can buy it in large tanks and have
	a chemical factory fill it up for you or you may produce it.
	Using Calcium Rock. Explained in file #4.
	Now after the balloon is filled with hydrogen. Throw it into
	a crowd of people smoking. Someone may try popping the balloon
	with the cigerette and BOMB!, They won't get hurt at all.
