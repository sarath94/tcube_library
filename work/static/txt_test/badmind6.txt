  Light bulb bomb
  Lighter bomb
  Molotov Cocktain
  Pipe Bomb
  ======================

        We are now beginning to get into some highly dangerous things.
        Be safe.

                        =====================
                           Light Bulb Bomb
                        =====================

        Get a normal light. And using a lighter or blow torch.
        Heat the metal part of the bulb. It'll start to come lose and
        then you can take it off. After having the metal part of the
        light bulb off, Put some type of fast burning powder in the glass
        part. Now, This is the hard part. Try put the metal part back
        with out damaging the glass. Then put glue around it so the metal
        part won't come off. Heat it a little bit so the metal melts back
        on the light. Now you have made a neat bomb. Place it somewhere to
        cool down. To work it, Put it in the circuit and make sure the
        electric charge isn't running though it. Now wait till some idiot
        turns it on and POW!, It may not do a explosion like you'd see on
        TV, But it will be weird and funny.

                        ==================
                           Lighter Bomb
                        ==================

        Lighter bombs a quite easy to make. Just get about 4 lighters,
        and some lighter fluid or solvent coment. And tape the 4 lighters
        together. Not to fancy though. Then there's a choice. Through
        it. Sometimes it'll work. You'll be lucky if it does or just pour
        either the fluid or solvent coment on it. It'll burn a while and
        explode. Pretty neat. Some times they pop and the gas shots up
        in the air and then burns up. A flame once shot 4 feet light.

                        ======================
                           Molotov Cocktain
                        ======================

        This is a simple device that anyone can make. Simply get
        a bottle and fill it with a highly flammable liquid.
        Gas, Turpentine, Lighter Fluid. Then did a rage in Solvent
        and let it dry. Then again dip it into the solvent coment
        for using. Then cork the bottle with the rag and light the
        rag and throw it. Try filling the bottle with Solvent coment
        and using the same type rag. It'll do a all different thing.

                                ===============
                                   Pipe Bomb
                                ===============

        A pipe bomb is quite simple to make though there's problms with it.
        Plastic or metal you can use. Though pipe bombs tend to be
        the most backfiring explosive from Nitroglyerin. Follow the steps.

        1, Get the most fast burning powder.
        2, Get 3 inch wide and 12 inch long pipe (Plastic or Metal)
        3, Follow the diagram.

      Following this diagram, It's very strait forward. Make the
      Corks on each end of the pipe very strong and best to hammer
      each side in after finished. put tissue on one end where the last
      hammering will be so it won't ignite the fast burning powder.
