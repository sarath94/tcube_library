The Potato Bazooka!
From the people who brought you the tennis ball 
cannon, and the potato gun, comes the newest device
for home safety and recreation!

Well it seems to have spread across the country :-)
I was talking to my dad in N.C. who said that all 
of the kids over 30 were playing with potato
bazookas :-)  And that it was developed in CA.
and introduced to the East Coast.  Now Rush
Limbaugh ?sp. has talked about it!  Well, I built
one from verbal instructions and it works! It has
a few bugs to be worked out, but all in all, it's
very impressive.  I thought I would post an acsii
drawing of it to the net ;-)

Assemble all the parts (except the screw cap) and
glue them together using ABS glue.  Fit the gas grill
ignitor through the middle of the 12" section of tube.
So far, what I have seen that works is to load a
potato plug, spray a couple shots of Aquanet Hairspray
into the other end, screw on the cap, and using a
30" plunger - push the potato plug down the 36" tube.
Aim (never aim this at a person or animal!!) and fire!
It will launch a potato plug about 1200'!!!

I will not assume any responsibility for your ability
to build this correctly, choice of fuel, ammo, or
choice of target.  You are responsible for your
actions.  Be careful and have fun :-) 
If this is illegal in your state, I am not responsible
if you break the law.
