These are neat things to make, even if they are dangerous. After the sort of depressing file on napalm, we figured this was as good a time as any to tell you about this.  These bazookas really pack a whallop, but won't kill someone.  I love to play with 'em.  Anyway, ahem, here we go.

Get 5 coke cans and cut the tops and bottoms off of 4 of them with some tinsnips or something.  Make sure to keep them round by only cutting one side at once, not both at the same time.  Flat cans just don't work.

Now, make a hole big enough to put a match, rocket igniter, or something that creates flame (those electronic firestarters are ideal.  Just cut a big hole in the side of one can, put in the firestarter, and seal it off with lotsa duct tape or something.

Put another small hole in the top of the cannon.  I put a little funnel I made from some scrap tin in this hole, but that's not needed.  All this hole is for is loading the propellant: lighter fluid.

Now, wrap the whole damn thing in about 20 layers of duct tape.  It should be airtight and not melt.  After a few usings, it gets pretty hot.  If you have enough duct tape around the thing, it won't matter if it melts a little bit.

Now, take apart one of those $4 cap pistols to get a gun handle.  If you want to try to hook the trigger up to a switch to ignite the lighter fluid, that's fine, but I find it's not worth the effort.  Now, melt the plastic on the parts of the gun that are going to be touching the duct tape and some of the duct tape where you are going to put it. Push them together and slide them around, so you get a good bond.  If possible, try to wrap some duct tape around the handle and top of the can for some added strength.

Now, build a sight.  I just melted and taped a 1.5 cm pvc sewer tube I got at a local plumber's to the side of my bazooka.  Make sure the handle and sight are placed where the most comfort and workability can happen.  Make sure you can stick a tennis ball in the end of the tube and squirt
some lighter fluid into the hole in the back of the tube with ease.

Think about cutting out some foam rubber as some padding.  A round tube, no matter how light, can get very hard and heavy after a while.  Cut the foam rubber to fit the curve of your shoulder.  Now, cut a slit halfway between where the tube and your shoulder is going to go.  Stick the duct tape through there, then wrap it around the cans.  You are going to be very grateful for this shoulder pad.

Now, to test it.  Put the tube on the ground with a tennis ball somewhere in it.  Squirt a little bit of lighter fluid into the hole in the back, and move as far away as possible and still be able to light it.  Try holding the match with some pliers or something, because lighter fluid isn't very forgiving stuff.  Now, light the stuff through the hole.  If it worked, the tennis ball will go flying out the front of the tube.  If not, it might blow up.  Once you have recovered from your burns, you could try again.

Once you have made sure it works alright and is very strong, you may use it freely.  I wouldn't advise tennis ball wars because these high-velocity balls hurt.

Here's a great thing to try: soaking the tennis ball in gasoline or kerosene before sticking it in the tube.  You get to shoot fireballs or comets and light on fire whatever is on the other side of the flaming tennis ball's trajectory.  My bitchy neighbor was gardning and I zinged one right over her shoulder.  You never saw someone so fat run so fast!  Great effect.

There you go.  Seeya...
