    Every anarchist should have a fully equiped BB gun arsenal, ranging from
your CO2 handgun to the pump shotgun. They are indeed a neccessaty in todays
world. We will tell you what kind to buy a=d how to use them......

Home Arsenal:
1) A Handgun, Daisy or Winchester
2) Pump Rifles, Winchesters are better
3) Gold Chest BB's King Size, they come in a big box of 2,000 packets, each 
   packet contains 150-200 individual BB's
4) Smoke bombs and M-80's

How to use your Arsenal Effectivly:
   When you first get your guns, go down into the basement and set up a firing 
range for you to practice. So you will be good and be sure to practice alot.
Once you are ready, assemble an assault force with your friends make it not to
big maybe 4 kids armed with guns. You can either plan a hit or just go on
a rampage through the neighborhood. If you have a planned hit, study him/she
or it for a couple of days, send them/owners a death threat made of letters
cut out of magazines to make them really scared, also tell them when and where.
Now when the time comes, plan out your escape route carfully and go to it,
I usauly send two kids to make the hit while the other two ward off incoming
traffic/people. Rush in, light the smoke bombs/M-80's and throw them, let them 
Know your there! and hit your target. Retreat into a safe spot and watch what
happens. If your just out rampaging, shoot windows because it's not going
to do damage to would or steele, maybe car doors. Birdfeeders are good
dogs, people, anything that can be hurt! but make sure you don't stay in
one area tooooooo long or else the cops might wonder by.
    Have Phun and good hunting!
