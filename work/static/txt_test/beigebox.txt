        So you saw this on your local Cat-Fur - AE - BBS line and you had
nothing better to do than download it? And you have some asshole neighbors
that you would like to get even with? The kind who have that dog that barks
his ass off all night...or the ones who always complains about you playing
your stereo to loud...or the ones whose car you've wanted to blow up, but
you're not anarchistic enough? Well, then this is for you!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



        First you have to wait until they go away on vacation, or if you 
don't want to wait that long then you have to do it after they go to bed.

        After you have a time set, you have to have the following parts:

   1 Beige box [see file by the Exterminator and the Terminal Man]
   1 Small speaker
   2 wires with aligator clips on the ends
   1 White box [only is your beige box doesn't have dialing capibilities]
   1 canister of Mace (optional)
   1 flashlight

        Now go to the house when it is dark...wear: black clothing and
sneakers (in case you gotta run for it!). And have some mace to fend off
the neighborhood dogs and the flash light. Ok now that that you're all set:
find the place on your neighbors house where the fone line is connected.
Now take the cover off the box and you should see a couple poles with red
and green wires connected to them and going into the house. Take the wires
of the beige box and and connect them to the poles and you should get a dial
tone...Now you must dail the number for time on the other side of the U.S.
(you must have this number before hand, and you can get it from some sysop of
a BBS that is FAR away). The stupid service will keep giving the time untill
you hang up...so what you must do is take the other wires with the alligator
clips and connect the ends to the speaker and the poles where the Beige box
is connected...now when you unconnect the Beige box....there will still be
a connection...so your neighbor will get charged for it! Another way to do
it is to have a someone you know thru the modem be at a 'off the beaten path'
pay fone, and you can call that and he will leave the fone off the hook, and
hopefully it will stay that way for a while.  It will be best to get the
the rig off your neighbor's house the next night...so they don't find it!
Or if they are there in the morning...make sure you get it before they try
to call out!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other fun thing's to do:


1> Go to their house night after night when they are asleep and use your
   Beige box to phreak with a real OLD MCI number! They will probably get
   traced and busted...this is best if you know they have a computer
   and a modem!

2> Make a Black Box and connect it to their line, but make it as small as
   possible so it is not noticed untill the Bell guy comes to check why the
   people fone rings for hours on end and busts the people for defrauding
   AT&T.

3> Record some Blue Box tones...or take one to the house...and Blue Box from
   their line with the Beige box, it will work especially well if you live in
   an ESS switching system (traced in UNDER A SECOND when a 2600 hertz tone
   is out of place ANYWHERE!)
