Opening:  Greetings!  Welcome to my first major production.  What the hell is
this guy babbling about "black books"?  Well, in the 60's a special forces
program was developed at the Frankford arsenal to develop and test improvised
explosives.  What you see here are the results of these tests.  Typed directly
from Army TM 31-210 and Desert Publication's Black Book Vol. III.  


Disclaimer: I take absolutely no responsibility for the use of this material,
whether it be direct or indirect.  What I have done here is simply provide this
information for one purpose only (har har) and that is for informational
purposes only.  All information here, however, should be taken as seriously as
the bible. You can very easily fuck up and get killed.  Please be very, very
careful (shit, i sound like your mother) when dealing with any of the items
presented here.  Note especially the section on improvised pistols.      


                                                thanx. and by god...

                                                HAVE PHUN!

1.  Spread potassium chlorate crystals thinly on a hard surface.  Roll the
    round stick over crystals to crush into a very fine powder or wheat flower.

2.  Place 9 parts powdered potassium chlorate and 1 part petroleum jelly
    in a wide bowl or similar container.  Mix ingredients with hands 
    until a uniform paste is obtained.

Note: Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.


                                                            
Potassium Nitrate                                           Sec. I, No. 2

Potassium nitrate can be extracted from many natural sources and can be used to
make nitric acid, black powder and many pyrotechnics.  The yield ranges from .1
to 10% by weight, depending on the fertility of the soil.

alcohol - 1 gallon (4 l) can be whiskey,
rubbing, etc.

heat source

paper

tape   

Note: Only the ratios of the amounts of ingredients are important.  Thus, for
twice as much, double all quantities.


Procedure
---------

1.  Punch holes in bottom of bucket.  Spread one piece of cloth over holes 
    inside bucket.

2.  Place wood ashes on cloth and spread to make a layer about the thickness of
    the cloth.  Place second piece of cloth on top of ashes.

3.  Place dirt in bucket.

4.  Place bucket over shallow container.  Bucket may be supported on sticks if
    necessary.
.5.  Boil water and pour it over earth in bucket a little at a time.  Allow
    water to run through holes in bucket into shallow container.  Be sure water
    goes through all the earth.  Allow drained liquid to cool and settle for 1
    to 2 hours.

Note: Do not pour all the water at once, as this may cause stoppage.

6.  Carefully drain off liquid into heat resistant container.  Discard any 
    sludge remaining in bottom of the shallow container.

7.  Boil mixture over hot fire for at least 2 hours.  Small grains of salt will
    begin to appear in the solution.  Scoop these out as they form, using any 
    type of improvised strainer (paper, etc)

8.  When liquid has boilded down to approx. half its original volume, remove
    from fire and let sit.  After half an hour, add an equal volume of alcohol.
    When mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals will collect on
    top of it.

9.  To purify the potassium nitrate, re-dissolve the dry crystals in the 
    smallest possible amount of boiled water.  Remove any salt crystals that
    appear (step 7); pour through an improvised filter made of several pieces
    of paper and evaporate of gently heat the concentrated solution to dryness.

10. Spread crystals on plat surface and allow to dry.  The crystals are now 
    ready to use.

Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups (.5 l)

Sulfur, powdered, .5 cup (1/8 l)

Alcohol, 5 pints (2.5 l) whiskey, rubbing, etc.

water 3 cups, (.75 l)

heat source

2 buckets- each 2 gallon (7.5 l) cap., one of
which must be heat resistant (metal, ceramic)

Flat window screen 1 foot square

large wooden stick

cloth, 2 ft. sq.


Procedure
---------

1.  Place alcohol in one of the buckets.

2.  Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant bucket.
    Add 1 cups water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all ingredients
    are dissolved.

3.  Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture.  Place bucket on heat source and 
    stir until small bubbles begin to form.

Note: Do NOT boil mixture.  Be sure all mixture stays wet.  If any is dry, as on sides of pan, it may ignite.

4.  Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
    vigorously.

5.  Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes.  Strain mixture through cloth to
    obtain black powder.  Discard liquid.  Wrap cloth around black powder and
    squeeze to remove all excess liquid.

6.  Place screening over dry bucket.  Place workable amount of damp powder on
    screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen.

Note: If granulated particles appear to stick together and change shape,
recombine entire batch of powder and repeat steps 5 and 6.  

7.  Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about .5" (1.25
    cm) is formed.  Allow to dry.  Use radiator, or direct sunlight.  This 
    should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in one hour.  The longer 
    the drying period, the less effective the black powder. 

Note: Remove from here as soon as granules are dry.  Black powder is now ready
for use.



                                                            
Nitric Acid                                                 Sec. I, No. 4

Nitric acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incendiary mixtures
and acid delay timers.  It may be prepared by distilling a mixture of potassium
nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.

---------                                       -------

Potassium nitrate (2 parts by volume)           Drug store, improvised, (Sec. I
                                                No. 2)                   

Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 part by vol)      motor vehicle batteries,
                                                industrial plants

2 bottles or ceramic jugs (narrow necks
preferable)

pot or frying pan

Heat source

Tape (paper, electrical, not cellophane)

Paper or rags 

Note: If sulfuric acid is obtained from motor vehicles, it must be concentrated
by boiling until white fumes appear.  Do NOT inhale fumes.  Also, the amount of
nitric acid produced is the same as the amount of potassium nitrate used, so 
for 2 tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2 tablespoons potassium nitrate and 1
tablespoon sulfuric acid.

Procedure
---------

1.  Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug.  Add sulfuric acid.  Do not 
    fill more than 1/4 full  Mix until a paste is formed.

Note: Treat sulfuric acid like any other acid, wash affected skin with water,  
and dont inhale the fucking fumes.

2.  Wrap paper or rags around necks of 2 bottles.  Securly tape necks of 
    bottles together.  Be sure bottles are flush against each other and that 
    there are no air spaces.

3.  Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is slightly lower 
    than bottle sontaining paste so that nitric acid is formed in receiving 
    bottle will not run into other bottle.

4.  Build fire in pot or frying pan.

5.  Gently heat bottle containing mixture by moving fire in and out.  As
    red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cold water over empty receiving
    bottle.  Nitric acid will begin to form in the receiving bottle.

Note: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter.  As
an added protection, place bottle to be hated in a heat resistant container
filled with sand or gravel.  Hear this outer container to produce nitric acid.

6.  Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed.  If the
    nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it
    into cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.

Note:  Do not inhale fumes, and nitric acid should be stored in a sealed glass 
or ceramic container.




Initiator for dust explosions                               Sec I, No. 5

An initiator which will initiate common material to produce dust explosions can
be rapidly and easily constructed.  This type of charge is ideal for the
destruction of enclosed areas such as rooms or buildings.

Materials                                       Sources     
---------                                       -------

a flat can, 3 in. (8 cm) in diameter and
1-1.5 in. (3-3.75 cm) in height.  A 6.5 oz.
Tuna can serves the purpose quite well

blasting cap

explosive

aluminum (may be wire, cust sheet, flat can,
or powder)

large nail, 4 in. (10 cm) long

wooden rod, .25 in. (6 mm) in diameter

flour, gasoline, and powder or chipped aluminum

Note: Plastic explosives (comp. C4, etc.) produce larger explosions that cast
explosives (comp. B, etc).


Procedure
---------

1.  Using the nail, press a hole through the side of the Tuna can 3/8 to 1/2 
    in. (1-1.5 cm) from the bottom.  Using a rotating a lever action, enlarge 
    the hole until it will accomodate the blasting cap.

2.  Place the wodden rod in the hole and position the end of the rod at the 
    center of the can.

3.  Press explosive into the can, being sure to surround the rod, until it is
    3/4 in. (2 cm) from top of the can.  Carefully remove the wooden rod.

4.  Place the aliminum metal on top of the explosive.

5.  Just before use, insert the blasting cap into the cavity made by the
    rod.  The initiator is now ready for use.

Note: If it is desired to carry the initiator some distance, cardboard may be
pressed on top of the aluminum to insure against loss of material.


How to Use
----------

This particular unit works quite well to initiate charges of five pounds of
flour, 1/2 gallon (1 2/3 l) of gasoline or two pounds of flake painters
aluminum.  The solid materials may merely be contained in sacks or cardboard
cartons.  The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated paper milk cartons,
plastic or glass bottles.  The charges are placed directly on top of the
initiator and the blasting cap is actuated electrically or by fuse depending on
the type of cap used.  This will destroy a 2,000 cubic feet enclosure (building
10x20x10 feet)

Note: For larger enclosures, use proportionally larger initiators ad charges.

Fertilizer Explosive                                        Sec. I, No. 6

An explosive munition can be made from fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate and
either fuel oil or a mixture of equal parts of motor oil and gasoline.  When
properly prepared, this explosive can be detonated with a blasting cap.

Materials                                       Sources
---------                                       -------

Ammonium nitrate (not less than 32% nitrogen)   farm, feed stores

Fuel oil or gasoline and motor oil (1:1)        cars, trucks

Two flat boards, One which can be 
comfortably held in the hand, i.e., 2"x4",
and 36"x36" 
    
Bucket or other container for mixing items

Iron or steel pipe or bottle, tin can or heavy
walled cardboard tube

blasting cap

wooden rod, 1/4" in. diameter

spoon or similar measuring container


Procedure
---------

1.  Spread a hadful of the ammonium nitrate (an) on the large flat board and
    rub vigorously with the other board until the large particles are crushed
    into a very fine powder that looks like flour (approx. 10 min. per handful)

Note: Continue with step 2 as soon as possible, since the powder may take
moisture from the air and become spoiled.

2.  Mix on measure (cup, tablespoon, etc) of fuel oil with 16 measures of the 
    finely ground AN in a dry bucket or other suitable container and stir with
    the wooden rod.  If fuel oil is not available, use one half measure of 
    motor oil.  Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.

3.  Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has and end cap 
    threaded on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin 
    can, a glass jar or a heavy-walled cardboard tube.

Note:  Take care not to tamp or shake the mixture in the pipe.  If mixture
becomes tightly packed, one cap will not be sufficient to initiate the
explosive.

4.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the open end of the container will add to the effectiveness of
the explosive.


Carbon Tet Explosive                                        Sec. I, No. 7

A moist explosive can be made from fine aluminum powder combined with carbon

Procedure
---------

1.  Measure out two parts aluminum powder to one part carbon tetrachloride or 
    tetrachloroethylene liquid into the mixing container, adding liquid to 
    powder while stirring with the wooden rod.

2.  Stir until the mixture becomes the consistency of honey syrup.

Note: Fumes from the liquid are dangerous and should not be inhaled.

3.  Store explosive in a jar or similar waterproof container until ready to 
    use.  The liquid in the mixture evaporates quickly when not confined.

Note:  Liquid will detonate in this manner for a period of 72 hours.


How to Use
----------

1.  Pour this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap threaded 
    on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin can or a
    glass jar.

2.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the open end of the explosive will add to the effectiveness of
the explosive.

potassium nitrate (granulated)- 2.33 cups

white sugar (granulated)- 2 cups

powdered ferric oxide (rust)- 1/8 cup

clear water- 3.5 cups  
        

Procedure
---------

1.  Place the sugar, potassium nitrate (pn), and water in the bucket.  Heat 
    with a low flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and PN dissolve.

2.  If available, add the ferric oxide (rust) to the solution.  Increase the 
    flame under the mixture until it boils gently.

Note: The mixture will retain the rust coloration.

3.  Stro and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture is 
    reduced to one quarter its original volume, then stir continuously.

4.  As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker until it reaches
    the consistency of cooked breakfast cereal (yum!) or homemade fudge.  At
    this stage of thickness, remove the bucket from the hear source and spread
    the mass on the metal sheet.

5.  While the material cools, score it with the spoon or spatula in 
    crisscrossedfurrows about 1 inch apart.

6.  Allow the material to air dry, preferably in the sun.  As it dries, rescore
    it occasionally (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.

7.  When the material has dried to a point to where it is moist and soft
    but not sticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the screen.  Rub
    the aterial back and forth against the screen mesh with a spoon or other 
    flat object until the material is granulated into small worm-like 
    particles.

8.  After granulation, return the material to the sun to dry completely.

Procedure
---------

1.  Add 24 teaspoons of sulfuric acid to 16.5 teaspoons of nitric acid in the
    2 qt. jar.

2.  Place the jar in the pan (3-5 gallon) filled with cold water or in a stream
    and allow to cool.

3.  Rapidly swirl the jar to create a whirlpool in the liquid (without 
    splashing) while keeping the bottom portion of the jar in the water.

4.  While continually swirling, add to mixture, .5 teaspoon at a time, 13.5
    teaspoons of methyl alcohol, allowing the mixture to cool at least one
    minute between additions.

DANGER! PELIGRO!- If there is a sudden increase in the amount of fumes produced
of if the solution turns much darker or begins to froth, dump the solution in
the water within 10 seconds!  This will help lengthen your life, and prevent an
accident.

5.  After the final addition of methyl alcohol, swirl for another 35-40 
    seconds.

6.  Carefully pour the solution into one of the narrow glass jars.  Allow jar
    to stand in water for approx. 5 minutes until two layers separate.

7.  With an eyedropper or styringe, remove top layer and CAREFULLY put into 
    another narrow glass jar.  This liquid is the explosve.

Note: Thought I should tell you, this is shock sensitive. (very)

8.  Add an equal quantity of water to the explosive and swirl.  Allow mixture
    to separate again as in step 6.  The explosive is now the bottom layer.

9.  Carefully remove the top layer with the eyedropper or styringe and 
    discard.

10. Place one firmly packed cup of absorbent in the tray. 

11. While stirring with the wooden stick, slowly add explosive until the mass
    is very damp but not wet enough to drip.  Explosive is ready to use.

Note: If it gets too wet, add more absorbent.  If storage is required, store in
a sealed container to prevent evaporation.  Do not allow this to touch the 
skin.  If it does, flush with large quantities of water.  Keep grit, dirt, and
sand out of the mix.


How to Use
----------

1.  Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap 
    threaded on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin
    can or a glass jar.

2.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surfacr of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the other end will add to the effectivenessof the explosive.

1.  Dilute 5 teaspoons of nitric acid with 2.5 teaspoons of clean water in a
    glass container by adding the acid to the water.

2.  Dissolve 1/8 teaspoon of mercury in the diluted nitric acid.  This will
    yield dark red fumes.

Note:  It may be necessary to add water, one drop at a time, to the 
mercury-acid solution in order to start reaction.  Also take usual precautions
when handling acid.

3.  Warm 10 teaspoons of the alcohol in a container until the alcohol feels 
    warm to the inside of the wrist.

4.  Pour the metal-acid solution into the warm alcohol.  Reaction should start
    in less than 5 minutes.  Dense white fumes will be given off during
    reaction.  As time lapses, the fumes will become less dense.  Allow 10
    to 15 minutes to complete reaction.  Fulminate will settle to bottom.

Note: This reaction generates large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes.  The
process must be conducted outdoors or in a well ventilated area, away from
sparks or flames.  Do not inhlale fumes unless you like death.

5.  Filter the solution through a paper towel into a container.  Crystals may
    stick to the side of the container.  If so, tilt and squirt water down the 
    sides of the container until all the material collects on the filter paper.

6.  Wash the crystals with 6 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol.

7.  Allow these to dry.

Note: Handle dry explosives with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it
roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool dry place.

6.  Let the acetone/peroxide/sulfuric acid mixture stand in the ice/water/salt
    bath or remove the inner container and place it in an ice box for 12-24
    hours.

7.  After 12 hours, white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of 
    the once clear solution.  Precipitation should be completed after 24 hrs.

Note: At this point the mixture is a primary explosive.  Keep away from shock,
friction and flame.

8.  Filter the mixture through a paper twoel into a container to collect all
    of the solid particles.

9.  Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with small amounts 
    of ice cold water poured over them.  Discard the liquid in the container.

10. Place these explosive crystals in a container and allow to dry.

Note: Handle the dry explosive with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it
roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool, dark, dry
place.

How to Use
----------

Acetone peroxide is a powerful initiator and can be used by itself as the main
filler when making homeade detonators.  Using 2.5" lengths of brass or copper
tubing with one end sealed shit with either solder or epoxy resin, begin by
partiallly filling the tube with acetone perroxide and compressing with a
loading press (Sec. VI, No. 13, Vol. 2 and Sec. II, No. 12, Vol 3).  Continue
This process until the explosive is within 1/2" of the top.  Cap the open end
tightly with a cork or wood stopper.  When ready to use, remove stopper and
insert time fuse.  Seal around fuse and tube insert into the main charge to a
depth of 2".  The caps will detonate most of the explosives shown in this
volume.

Note: These detonators should be used withing 7 days of thier manufacture and
should be stored in a cool, dry place.            



                                                            
Bullseye (low-high) Explosive                               Sec. I, No. 27

A highly effective and powerful low - high explosive can be obtained by simply
using a fast burning double-based, smokeless pistol powder called Bullseye. 
This propellant is used to reload pistol and revolver cartridges and contains a
sensitive mixture of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose.

                                                fine National Guard bases

How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a low explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end caps
    and ignite with a time fuse.  When ignited, the pipe will explode into many
    fragments traveling at a velocity of approximately 600 fps.

2.  To use as a high explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end 
    caps, insert a compound detonator with a fuzing mechanism and detonate.
    When detonated, the pipe will fragment into many small fragments traveling
    at a velocity in excess of 20,000 fps.

Note: Because of the unique mixture of nitroglycering with nitrocellulose
(double-base), Bullseye is one of the few propellants that can be detonated 
with a blasting cap.  When detonated, it is a powerful as military TNT and
should be used to defeat hard targets.

    under strong confinement and only as an explosive filler for antipersonnel
    fragmentation bombs.  To use, spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe
    which has an end cap on one end.

2.  Insert a compound detonator just beneath the surface of the explosive and
    screw the other end cap on with a hole drilled through for the fuse.

Note: Take care not to tamp or shake the mixture in the pipe.  If the mixture
becomes tightly packed, one cap will not be sufficient to detonate the
explosive.  Store in tightly sealed container.

Potassium chlorate/Notrobenzene Explosive               Sec. I, No. 32

A moise explosive can be made from solid potassium chlorate and liquid
nitrobenzene.  This explosive has medium to high power and brisance.  It can be
used as a substitute for 50% ditching dynamite or flake TNT.  This exlosive can
be readily detonated by a standard blasting cap (No. 6).

Two flat boards (from No. 31)  

Blasting cap (No. 6)


Procedure
---------

1.  Use step one from No. 31 to pulverize the potassium chlorate.

Note: Nitrobenzene is extremely toxic and should be handled in well ventilated
areas.  Harmful effects may result from swallowing, inhalation of vapors, or
contact with the skin or eyes.  In case of accidental spilling, wash the
addected area immediately with large quantities of water.

2.  To produce the explosive, all that is required is to pour 1 part by volume,
    20% by weight of nitrobenzene into 4 parts by volume, 80% by weight, of 
    powdered potassium chlorate.  Stir until completely mixed, then store
    in a sealed container wintil ready for use.

3.  Another effective method in producing the explosive is to tightly pre-pack
    a selected charge container with powdered potassium chlorate.  When 
    ready for use, simply pour the pre-measured amount of nitrobenzene into the
    potassium chlorate and allow to soak for 3 to 3 minutes before using.

Note: An important factor to observe when pouring the nitrobenzene into the
potassium chlorate is to not allow the potassium chlorate to be disturbed after
it has been soaked with nitrobenzene.  Whenever a liquid is poured into a
powdered substance, a natural "caking action" will result, producing a fairly
uniform density throughout the solid material.  Since uniform density has a
direct overall effect on the explosive performance, it is important to first
pre-pack a rigid container with the potassium chlorate and then pour in the
nitrobenzene and allow it to soak in without stirring.  This will produce a 
high performance explosive.  Mixing in a plastic bag will produce a low
performance exlosive. 
    

How to Use
----------

1.  This mixture forms a very powerful explosive that can be used for general
    purpose blasting and ditching operations.  It is extremely sensitive to
    detonation and can be initiated by simple homemade detonators.
