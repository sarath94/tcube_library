 this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap 
    on one end.

3.  Insert a compound detonator just beneath the surface of the explosive and 
    screw the other end cap on with a hole drilled through for the fuse.

4.  The pipe can be pre-filled with sawdust.  When ready for use,  simply pour
    in the nitromethane, then detonate. 




Nitromethane/Ammonium Nitrate Explosive                 Sec. I, No. 34

A moist explosve can be made from solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer combined
with liquid nitromethane.  This explosive has both high power and high brisance
and can be used as a direct substitute for TNT.  This explosive can be readily
detonated by a blasting cap, No. 6 in strength.  A compound detonator is not
required.

Two flat boards (same as No. 30)
  
Blasting cap (No. 6)

Procedure
---------

1.  Spread a handful at a time of the fertilizer on the large flat board and
    rub vigirously with the other board or rolling pin until the large
    particles are crushed into a fine powder that looks like flour (approx. 10
    minutes per handful)

Note: Proceed with steps 2 and 3 as soon as possible, since the powder may 
moisture from the air and become spoiled.

2.  To produce the explosive, all that is required is to pour 1 part by volume 
    or 2 parts by weight of nitromethane into 3 parts by volume or 5 parts by
    weight of powdered ammonium nitrate.  Stir until completely mixed, then
    store in a sealed container until ready to use.

3.  Another effective method in producing the explosive is to tightly pre-pack
    a selected charge container with powdered ammonium nitrate.  When ready
    to use, simply pour the pre-measured amount of nitromethane into the
    ammonium nitrate and allow to soak in for 3 to 5 minutes before using.

Note: An important factor to observe when pouring the nitromethane into the
ammonium nitrate is to not allow the ammonium nitrate to be disturbed after it
has been soaked with nitromethane.  Whenever a liquid is poured into a powdered
substance, a natural "caking action" will result, producing a fairly uniform
density throughout the solid material.  Since uniform density has a direct
overall effect of the explosive performance, it is important to first pre-pack 
a rigid container with ammonium nitrate and then pour in the nitromethane and
allow to soak without stirring.  This will produce a high performance 
explosive.  Mixing in a plastic bag will produce a low performance explosive.


How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive is one of the most powerful/brisant two component explosives
    readily available.  Each component is perfectly safe to handle by itself.
    However, when the two are mixed together, they form a sensitive high 
    explosive that can be detonated with a standard blasting cap.

2.  This explosive mixture should be used to defeat hard targets, such as steel
    and reinforced concrete.  It can also be used with special charges that
    require high brisance, i.e., shaped charges, platter charges, and SCIMP
    charges.




Nitromethane Liquid explosive                               Sec. I, No. 35

A liquid explosive, that resembles water in appearance, can be made from
nitromethane and aqueous ammonia (household glass cleaner).  This exposive is 
22 to 24 more powerful that military TNT and can be detonated with a standard
blasting cap.  However, to achieve maximum velocity, a compound detonator 
should be used.

Procedure
---------

Note: Nitromethane is a common chemical reagent, and under normal conditions
cannot be made to detonate even if a strong detonator is used.  However, if
certain ammonia-containing compounds (called sensitizers) are alled in small
percentages (5-6 %), then the sensitized nitromethane can be detonated with a
standard #8 blasting cap.  The most effective sensitizers are aniline and
ethylenediamine.  The most readily available sensitizer is common household
glass cleaner (aqueous ammonia).

1.  To produce the explosive, simply pour the sensitizer into the nitromethane
    and mix thoroughly.  One-half pic sensitizer will sensitize one gallon of
    nitromethane.

2.  The explosive can be premixed, or for safety's sake, it can be mixed just
    prior to use by prefilling a charge container with nitromethane and then 
    adding the sensitizer when ready to detonate.


How to Use
----------

1.  This liquid explosive can be used whenever or wherever a liquid can be 
    used for disguiseability.  It can be poured directly into prefabricated
    special charge containers, i.e., shape charges, platter charges, and SCIMP
    charges, without special measures being taken to maintain uniform densities
    required for solid explosives to be effective.

2.  To obtain the maximum efficiency, a compound detonator should be used for 
    initiation.  Reliability of initiation is increased by positioning and 
    immersing the detonator centrally with respect to the wall of the
    container.  By centrally positioning and immersing the detonator in the
    liquid, the output energy of the detonator is transmitted to the 
    explosive instead of being partially dissipated through the wall of the
    container.

Fertilizer/hydrazine liquid explosive                       Sec. I, No. 36

A liquid explosive can be made from solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer combined
with liquid anhydrous hydrazine.  This liquid explosive is more powerful and
brisant than C4 plastic explosive and can be used as a direct replacement for
C4.  This explosive can be detonated with a blasting cap.  However, to achieve
maximum velocity a compound detonator should be used.

Procedure
---------

Note:  Anhydrous hydrazine is classified as as corrosive and is flammable. 
Keep away from spark or flame.  It is also mildly toxic and should be handled 
in well ventilated areas.  Affected areas of skin should be washed with large
quantities of water.

1.  Pour into the mixing container an amount of anhydrous hydrazine equal to 
    the amount of explosive required.

2.  Ammonium nitrate (prilled or powdered) is then added, a teaspoon at a
    time, to the hydrazine in the mixing container.

Note: The mixing container should be fairly large (5x the volume of the
hydrazine) because the chemical reaction between the ammonium nitrate and the
hydrazine is extremely effervescent and can easily bubble over the top.

3.  Because of the effervescent reaction, the ammonium nitrate should be added
    very slowly so as not to create accidental over-flowing.  With each 
    addition of ammonium nitrate, the person doing the mixing should wait for
    the initial reaction to subside, then stir the solution until all of the
    ammonium nitrate dissolves into it.

Note: The reaction between the ammonium nitrate and hydrazine liberates large
volumes of poisonous gas.  The person doing the mixing should be upwind of the
mixing process so as not to breath the poisonous fumes.

4.  The  mixing process is continued until the ammonium nitrate no longer 
    dissolves into the solution, even after five minutes of stirring, and a 
    small amount reamains undissolved at the bottom of the mixing container.
    This undissolved ammonium nitrate does not affect the performance of the
    explosive.

5.  After the mixing process is complete, what will remain will be a clear
    liquid explosive more powerful and brisant that any military explosive.

Note: The mixed explosive has a lower toxicity of the hydrazine.  However, it 
is recommended that the same handling precautions be observed.

6.  To make an even more powerful explosive, 20% aluminum powder (100 mesh or
    finer) can be added to the ammonium nitrate  before mixing with the 
    hydrazine (it does not react with the other two ingredients), or ir can
    be added after the mixing process is complete. 

How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive is the most powerful/brisant of the two complement explosive
    systems available.  It can be used whenever or wherever a liquid can be 
    used for disguiseability.

2.  It can be poured directly into prefabricated special charge containers,
    i.e., shape, platter and SCIMP charges, without special measures being
    taken to maintain uniform densities required by solid explosives to be
    effective.

3.  It has unique absorption and retention poperties which can be used to
    create a liquid land mine.  The liquid explosive can be poured directly
    into the ground, soaking into and blending with the surrounding earth.
    The pocket of explosive can be initiated by a conventional electrically
    or mechanically actuated detonator.  These pockets of explosives have 
    remained detonable for four days in the ground, even when the soil was
    soaked due to rainy weather.

Explosive paper                                             Sec I, No. 37

An excellent absorption explosive can be made from a solution of PETN (the
center filler of detonator cord), acetone, and mineral oil.  When any non-gloss
paper, i.e., newspaper, paperback books, corrugated cardboard, etc., is dipped
in this explosive solution and then removed and allowed to dry, the paper will
retain its original texture and appearance along with a microcrystaline high
explosive incorporated into the fiber content of the paper.  This produces a
disguised explosive that can be carried into a target area without arousing
suspicion.

Procedure
---------

1.  Using a razor blade, cut detonating cord lengthwise and remove the center
    filler (P.E.T.N.).  Approx. .5 lb. of PETN can be removed per 100 ft. 
    of detonating cord.

2.  Fill a canning jar 2/3 full of acetone and heat until mildly warm by 
    placing the canning jar in a pan or bucket on heat source when it contains 
    the canning jar.

3.  Add PETN to the acetone, a tablespoon a a time, while stirring with a 
    stirring rod.  Stir the solution until the PETN dissolves.  Add more PETN
    until it no longer dissolves into solution, even after five minutes of 
    stirring.  Approx. 1/3 lb. of PETN will dissolve in every lb. of warm
    acetone used.

4.  Approx. 2% mineral should be added to the final solution.  This mineral
    oil will prevent the crystals of PETN from recrystalizing to a noticeable
    size when the acetone evaporates.  The mineral oil will also provide a 
    better texture to the paper when it is dry after the soaking process.

5.  Pout this solution into a large, flat pam, then fill the pan with even
    sheets of a non gloss paper.  It rolled newspaper is used, unroll it and
    lay it out evenly in the an.  Allow the paper to soak for 30 minutes.

6.  After soaking for 30 minutes, remove the paper and allow to dry for at 
    least 24 hours.  DO NOT DRY IN AN OVEN.  After the papr has had time to 
    dry, 50 % of its weight will consist of a microcrystaline high explosive
    intimately incorporated into the fiber content of the paper.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use simply insert a blasting cap ot compound detonator into the paper
    and detonate.

2.  If a rolled newspaper is used, the detonator and fusing mechanism  can
    be concealed in the center of the roll and easily carried into the 
    target area and left where destruction is desired.  An average size 
    newspaper has the explosive equivalent of several sticks of dynamite.

Procedure
---------


1.  Place .5 cup, 120 ml or cc of nitrix acid in a large canning jar and bring
    the temperature to between 20 and 30 degrees C. (68-86 F)  By putting the
    jar in a basin of cold water.  If necessary, swirl the canning jar around
    the basin of cold water to bring the temperature down, while being careful
    not to allow any water to splash into the acid.

Note:  Maintain the thermometer in the acid throughout the reaction while
carefully noting and controlling the temperature by alternating the jar between
the basin of cold water and the basin of hot water.  The thermometer can be 
used as a stirring rod if the solution is gently stirred.

2.  Weigh or measure out 70 grams by weight, 18 teaspoons by volume, of the 
    hexamine and start adding the salt-like hexamine slowly, 1/2 teaspoon
    at a time, during a 15 minute period.  Maintain the temp. between 20 - 30
    degrees C, while stirring gently with the thermometer.  Control the temp.
    by dipping the canning jar in and out of the basin filled with cold water.

3.  When all of the hexamine is dissolved in the acid, heat the solution to
    55 degrees C, by placing the canning jar in a bsin of hot water.  Maintain
    tis temperature for about 10 minutes.

4.  After heating the solution for 10 minutes, remove the canning jar from
    the basin of cold water and place it in the basin of cold water.  Cool the
    canning jar to 20 degrees C. (68 degrees F).

5.  When the temperature has reached 20 degrees C, add 3 cups (750 ml) of
    cold water to the solution and a white salt will appear.

Note:  The white salt is RDX and should be handled with great care from now on.

6.  Filter the acid/water/RDX solution through a paper towel covering the
    mouth of another jar.

7.  Wash the RDX crystals off the paper towel and into a canning jar, using
    an additional 3 cups of fresh, cold water.  Add a teaspoon of sodium 
    carbonate to neutralize the acid and stir rapidly for 2-3 minutes, then
    filter again.

8.  The crude product can be dried out on the paper towel filter.  It is 
    suitable for fairly immediate use, or it can be purified.

9.  To purify RDX, fill a quart canning jar 2/3 full of acetone.  Heat the
    acetone by placing the jar in a basin of hot simmering water, then add
    RDX, a tablespoon at a time, until it completely dissolves in the 
    acetone.

10. After the maximem amount of RDX has been dissolved into the hot acetone,
    allow the solution to cool to room temperature, then let stand for one
    more hour.

11. The RDX will form a salt once again.  Filter the RDX and spread it out on
    a paper towel as before.

12. The purified RDX should be stored in a clean canning jar with a tight
    fitting lid.  It can be stored for months without loss of effectiveness.

Note: RDX is not too sensitive to heat and shock, but is fairly sensitive to
friction.  Care should therefore be taken when the explosive is to be packed or
when the dry explosive is handled.  Using the amounts of chemicals listed in
this article, the yield of RDX should be about 1/5 oz.





Explosive Flour                                             Sec. I, No. 39

An explosive that looks and bakes like ordinary wheat flour can be made from a
mixture flour and RDX.  It can be used in many different forms as an explosive:
in its dry powder form, moistened with water and used as a dough like plastic
explosive, or by using special recipes it can be baked into pancakes or 
bisuits.

large sheet of wood, and a rolling pin
(wood must be flat)


Procedure
---------

1.  Place a tablespoonful of RDX crystals on the large sheet of wood.  Using
    a rolling pic, crush the crystals into a fine powder, the consistency of
    flour.

Note:  Use only a rolling pic, not a block of wood.  It is important to crush
the RDX crystals into a fine powder rather than using friction between to
rubbing surfaces.

2.  Mix 80% by weight of powdered RDX with 20% by weight of flour in a canning
    jar with a tight fitting lid by shaking for five minutes.

3.  The mixed explosive flour can be stored in the sealed mixing conainer for
    long periods of time before using.  It can also be disguised by storing
    it in an original bag of flour.


How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive flour is more powerful and brisant that military TNT and
    is easiest to detonate in its powdered form.  A standard blasting cap 
    provides sufficient shock to set it off.

2.  To use as a plastic explosive, mix 4 parts by weight of flour to 1 part
    by weight of water.  This forms a dough that has very desirable plastic 
    qualities which can be used to mold itself around vertain types of
    targets in the same manner as military C4 plastic explosive.  A compound
    detonator must be use to insure positive detonation.

3.  The following recipes make it possible to bake the powdered explosive into
    pancakes or biscuits:

    A.  For pancakes, use this recipe:

        3 cups explosive flour
        2 teaspoons of baking powder
       .5 teaspoon of salt
        1 cup of milk
        1 egg
        2 tablespoons of melted lard

Note: This pancake mixture can be left of the griddle until it completely chars
with no unusual effects,  thus demonstrating the stability of the mixture to
heat.

    B.  For explosive biscuits, use this recipe:

        3 cups explosive flour
        2 teaspoons of baking powder
      3/8 teaspoon of salt
        2 teaspoons of lard
       88 ml or cc of water

4.  The finished pancakes and biscuits look, feel, and taste like ordinary
    pancakes and biscuits.  However, they are highly toxic, and SHOULD NOT
    BE EATEN.  Before using these baked items as an explosive, they must be 
    moistened and kneaded into a plastic masss to remove the air spaces.  
    They may be exploded in the same manner as the plastic form.

Procedure
---------

1.  Place blasting cap on one end of fuse cord and crimp with pliers. 
    

Note:  To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it takes 
for a known length of fuse to burn.  If 12 inches burns in 30 seconds, a six
inch cord will ignite the grenade in 15 seconds.

2.  Screw pipe cap to one end of pipe.  Place fuse cord with blasting cap into
    the opposite end so that the blasting cap is near the center of the pipe.

Note:  If plastic explosive is to be used, fill pipe before inserting blasting
cap.  Push a round stick into the center of the exlosive to make a hole and 
then insert blasting cap.

3.  Pour exlposive or propellant into pipe a little at a time.  Tap the base 
    of the pipe frequently to settle filter.

4.  Drill a hole in the center of the unassembled pipe cap large enough
    for the fuse cord to pass through.

5.  Wipe pipe threads to remove any filler material.  Slide the drilled pipe
    cap over the fuse and screw handtight onto pipe.

    should be deep enough that the blasting cap is totally within the
    explosive.

2.  Tape, tie or glue on or two rows of closely packed nails to sides of 
    explosive block.  Nails should completely cover the four surfaces of the 
    block. 

3.  Place blasting cap on one end of the fuse cord and crimp with pliers.

Note: Use same method in Sec. II, No. 1 to determine burning lengths of fuse.

4.  Insert the blasting cap in the hole in the block of explosive.  Tape or tie
    fuse cord securly in place so that it will not fall out when the grenade 
    is thrown.


Alternate Use
-------------

An effective directional anti-personnel mine can be made by placing nails on
only one side of the explosive block.  For this case, an electric blasting cap
should be used.

Glass wine bottle with cone shaped false
bottom

Plastic or castable explosive

blasting cap

gasoline or kerosene (small amount)

string

adhesive tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Soak a piece of string in gasoline or kerosene.  Double wrap this
    string around the wine bottle approx. 3 in. above the top of the cone.

Note: Adding a small amount of motor oil to the gasoline or kerosene will
improve results.

2.  Ignite the string and allow to burn for 1 to 2 minutes.  Then plunge the
    bottle into cold water to crack it.  The top half can now be easily removed
    and discarded.

3.  If plastic explosive is used:

    A.  Pack explosive into the bottle a little at a time compressing with
        a wooden rod.  Fill the bottle up to the top.

    B.  Press a .25 in. wooden dowel .5 in into the middle of the top of 
        the explosive charge to form a hole for the blasting cap.

4.  If TNT or other castable explosive is used:

    A.  Break explosive into small pieces using a wooden mallet or non-
        sparking metal tools.  Place pieces in a tin can.    
                                               
    B.  Suspend this can in a larger container which is partly filled with
        water.  A stiff wire or stick pushed through the smaller can will
        accomplish this.

Note:  The inner can must not rest on the bottom of the outer container.

    C.  Heat the containr on a electric hot plate or other heat source.  Stir
        the explosive frequently with a wooden stick while it is melting.

Note: Keep area well ventilated while melting explosive.  Fumes may be
poisonous.

    D.  When all the explosive has melted, remove the inner container and 
        stir the molten explosive until it begins to thicken.  Diring this
        time the bottom half of the wine bottle should be placed in the
        container of hot water.  This will pre-heat the bottle so that it
        will not crack whenthe explosive is poured.

    E.  Remove the bottle from how water and dry thoroughly.  Pour molten
        explosive into the bottle and allow to cool.  The crust which
        forms on top of the charge during cooling should be broken with a
        wooden stick and more explosive added.  Do this as often as necessary 
        until the bottle is filled to the top.

    F.  When explosive has completely hardened, bore a hole for the blasting
        cap in the middle of the top of the charge about .5 in. deep.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place blasting cap in the hole in the top of the charge.  If non-electric
    blasting cap is used, be sure cap is crimped around fuze and fuze is 
    long enough to provide safe delay.

2.  Place the charge so that the bottom is 3-4 in. from the target.  This can
    be done by taping legs to the charge or any other convenient means as 
    long as there is nothing between the base of the charge and the target.

3.  If electric blasting cap is used, connect blasting wires to firing
    circuit.

Note: The effectiveness of this charge can be increased by placing it inside a
can, box, or similar container and packing sand or dirt between the charge and
the container.

Procedure
---------

Note: These were the only linear shaped charges of this type that were found to
be more efficient than the ribbon charge.

Ribbon Charge: No standoff; just place on target.

1.  If pipe is used:

    A.  Place the pipe in the vise and cut pipe in half lengthwise.  Remove the
        pipe half sections from the vise.

    B.  Discard one of the pipe half sections, or save for another charge.

2.  Place angle or pipe half section with open end face down on a flat surface.

3.  Make container from any material available.  The container must be as wide
    as the angle or pipe half section, twice as high, and as long as the 
    desired cut to be made with the charge.

4.  Place container over the liner (angle or pipe half section) and tape liner
    to container.

5.  If plastic explosive is used, fill the container with the explosive 
    ising small quantities, and tamp with wooden rod or stick.

Note: If castable explosive is used, refer to step 4 of Sec. II, No. 3.

6.  Cut wooden rod to lengths 2 inches longer than the standoff length (see 
    table).  Postition the rods at the corners of the explosive filled 
    container and hold in place with tape.

Note: The position of the rods on the container must conform to standoff and
penetration dimensions given in the table.

7.  Make a hole for blasting cap in the side od the container .5 in. above the
    liner and centered with the wooden rod.

Note: Do not place blasting cap inside Linear Shaped Charge until ready to
detonate.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place blasting cap into hole on the side of the container.  If non-electric
    cap is used, be sure cap is crimped around fuse and fuse is long enough.

2.  Place (tape if necessary) the LSC on the target so that nothing is between 
    base of charge and target.

3.  If electric cap is used, connect cap wires to firing circuit.

        thermite or aluminum granules.
    
    C.  Fill the remaining half of the bottom half with any powerful homemade
        explosvie.

    D.  Fill 1/2 to the top half with the same homemade explosive.

    E.  Insert the bottom half of the soap dish into the top half and secure
        in place with tape.


How to Use
----------

1.  Claymore mine:

    A.  Cover the bottom of the bottom half of the mine with double-sided
        adhesive tape or attach one horseshoe magnet to each side of the
        top half and secure in place with epoxy resin.  Both attachment 
        methods can be combined so the mine can be attached to almost any
        surface area.

    B.  Using a sharp pointed rod, 1/4 inch in diameter, puncture a hole
        in the rear center of the bottom half.

    C.  Insert a detonator into this hole and attach a fuzing mechanism to
        the sides of the soap dish and connect to the detonator.

    D.  Attach the bottom of the soap dish, vertically, to any surface 
        facing the target area, within a 45 degree angle from either side
        of the center line of the soap dish.  For attachment, use either
        the tape or magnets, or both if possible.


2.  P.O.L. charge:

    A.  Cover the bottom of the bottom half of the mine with double sided
        adhesive tap, or attach one horseshoe magnet to each side of the
        top half and secure in place with epoxy resin.  Both attachment
        methods can be combined so the mine can be easily be attached to 
        almost any surface area.

    B.  Using a sharp pointed rod, 1/4 inch in diameter, puncture a hole in 
        the rear certer of the top half of the soap dish.

    C.  Insert the detonator into this hole and attach a fuzing mechanism to 
        sides of the soap dish and connect to the detonator.

    D.  Using magnets, tape, or both, attach the bottom of the soap dish to
        any surface containing petroleum products, i.e., 55 gallon storage
        drums, rail and truck P.O.L. shipping cars, gas tanks of vehicles, etc.

 


Mini-Compound detonators                                    Sec. II, No. 12

Miniature compound detonators can be made from empty .22 Magnum sheel casings, 
a quantity of secondary (booster) explosive, a smaller quantity of primary
explosive, an ignition charge and a loading press.  These powerful miniature

Notes:  1.  Block- wood (10" x 10" x 6" or steel (6" x 6" x 6") with 3/8" 
            diameter hole 1" deep.

        2.  1/4"  O.D. hard brass or wood ram 

Note:  The loading press is provided with a protective barrier and a remote
system of rope and pulley operation to provide operator safety during loading. 
Only wood and spark-proof (brass) metals are used near the exlosive.

CAUTION:  Making detonators is hazardous business that can be made safe by
taking certain precautions.  Operations must be performed slowly and with great
care.  Cleanliness is important.  Dirt in the explosive or containers will
greatly increase sensitivity to detonation by impact or shock.  If possible the
air should be moist.  Boil a bucket of water in the room before starting to 
work if the air is dry.  When inserting and removing the ramrod and when
carrying primary explosives, use tongs or pliers.  If possible, uuse only one
hand at a time when handling the primary explosive in the loading process and
wear protective goggles at all times.

2.  With the arrangement shown on the preceeding page, the pressure applied
    to the exlosive inside the shell casing will be about 200x the force 
    applied to the end of the lever.  That is, a 20 pound weight pulling at
    at the handle will compress the explosive with a press of 4,000 lbs. of
    pressure per sq. in.  This pressure is required for the best sensitivity 
    of mercury fulminate.  A 2.5 gallon bucket of water weighs about 20 lbs.

3.  Light a candle and let two drops of wax drop into the bottom of each 
    shell casing before using.

4.  Allow the wax to cool, then insert the shell casing into the loading 
    block.

5.  Fill the shell casing to a depth of 1/4 in. with RDX or PETN secondary
    explosive.  Gently insert the ram.

6.  Compress the explosive slowly and evenly by pulling on the rope until the
    weight leaves the ground.  Remove the ram carefully.

7.  Continue the adding and pressing operation until a column of secondary 
    explosive 5/8 inch high has been pressed into the 1 inch long shell 
    casing.

8.  Add a small quantity of primary explosive on top of the secondary 
    explosive and gently insert the ram.

9.  Continue the adding and pressing operation until an additional 1/4 inch
    column of primary explosive has been pressed on top of the 5/8 inch column
    of secondary explosive.

10. Gently compress the remaining 1/8 inch of empty space with an igniter of
    either black powder or smokeless pistol powder.

11. Seal the top with either tape or wax paper held in place with a small
    rubber band until ready to use.

Note: When inserting the detonator into a selected hand grenade, be careful not
to tilt the detonator and let the igniter charge spill out.  Instead, place the
grenade over the detonator and lower it until the detonator is sealed into
place, then invert the genade and fill with explosive.

   



Cigarette Lighter Hand Grenade                              Sec. II, No. 13
                                                            
An effective and powerful miniature hand grenade can be made from a Zippo brand
cigarette lighter, any homemade explosive and a mini-compound detonator (Sec.
II, No. 12).  This explosive device can be used either as a hand grenade or a
boobytrap.

Materials
---------

Any powerful homemade explosive, i.e., potassium chlorate/nitrobenzene (Sec. I,
No. 32), ammonium nitrate/nitromethane (Sec. I, No. 34), etc.

Mini-Compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12)

Black powder (Sec. I, No. 3)

Zippo cigarette lighter, approx. 2 1/4" length x 1 1/2" Diam., or larger 

Copper and brass tubing 9/32" diameter x 12" long

hacksaw

small mixing bowl

epoxy resin


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a zippo lighter with outer case dimensions of approx. 2 1/4 long x
    1 1/2" wide x 1/2" deep.  Separate the inner lighter mechanism from the 
    outer casing and remove all the cotton wadding.

2.  Remove the cotton ignition wick and convert it into a black powder time
    fuse by the following steps:

    A.  Place a couple of tablespoons of black powder (sec. I, No. 3) into a
        small mixing bowl and add enough water until it looks like a heavy
        oil.

    B.  The cotton wick is placed in the oil-like mixture and stirred
        for 15 minutes so that it becomes saturated with the black 
        powder mix.

    C.  The cotton wick is removed and hung to dry for four hours.

    D.  This mixture fuse was found to have a burning rate of 1.3 seconds
        per inch.

Note: Be sure and test burning time on a similar wick before using.  If a new
Zippo lighter is used, it is necessary to use the lighter approx. 25 times
before disassembling.  This will make the lighter appear used and will blacken
the cotton ignition wick which will help disguise the black powder time fuse
that will be reinserted.

3.  Reinsert the cotton wick fuse through the wick hole and leave enough fuse 
    in the ignition chamber so that it can easily bepulled from the igniter.

Note: Knot the end of the fuse inside the lighter sothat it won't pull free
later when using.

4.  Using a hacksaw, cut a one inch length from a 9/32" diameter piece
    of copper or brass tubing.

5.  Insert this one inch tube over the wick hole and use a 1/8" layer of 
    epoxy resin or other strong glue to seal in place.

6.  Insert a mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12) into the holding
    tube inside the lighter.

Caution:  The mini-compound detonator is a sensitive and extremely powerful
detonator and should be handled carefully at all times.

7.  Fill the remaining space to within 1/8" of the bottom with any homemade 
    explosive this manual.

Note: The explosive can be loaded in first, and when ready to use, simply 
insert the detonator.  When using potassium chlorate or ammonium nitrate for a
base explosive, load the cigarette lighter with either base explosive and 
insert the detonator.  When ready to use, simply pour in the liquid activator 
of either nitromethane or nitrobenzene.

8.  After filling to within 1/8" in. of the bottom with explosive, cut off a 
    1/8" strip from the original cotton wadding and insert in the bottom of 
    the lighter to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a hand grenade, simply pull out a length of fuse and ignite
    with a separate cigarette lighter or match.

2.  To use as a boobytrap, insert the lighter, with a short fuse, into the
    target area.




Shotgun shell impact grenade                                Sec. II, No. 14

An effective and powerful impact grenade can be made from a 12 gauge shotgun
shell, any homemade high explosive and a mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No.
12).  This explosive devise can be used as an impact grenade or as a boobytrap.

Materials
---------

Any homemade explosive, i.e., potassium chlorate/nitrobenzene (Sec. I, No. 32),
ammonium nitrate/nitromethane (Sec. I, No. 34), etc.

Mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, NO. 12)

12 gauge shotgun shell   
         
wood dowel or steel bar 11/16" in diameter and any length beyond 1/2"

hacksaw

drill w/ 1/4" bit

pieces of cloth, 12" x 12"

epoxy resin or strong glue

steel ball bearings 3/8" in diameter

electrical tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Either cut off or open up the forward end of any 12 gauge shotgun shell and
    empty out the shot, wadding, spacer and propellant.  Retain the shell
    casing.

2.  In order for the mini-detonator to be over the center of the primer, a
    detonator guide cylinder has to be made from either a piece of bar
    steel or a wooden dowel in the following manner:

    A.  Using a hacksaw, cut a 1/2" length of 11/16" steel bar or wooden
        dowel.

    B.  Drill a 1/4" diameter hole in the center of the 1/2 long wood or 
        metal cylinder.

Note: It is preferred that a steel cylinder be used in ot to lend more weight 
to the base of the shell case.

3.  After the guide cylinder is prepared, it is glued in place in the bottom
    of the shotshell case.

Note: Do not place any glue on the primer in the base of the shell casing.

4.  The mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12) is the inserted, open end
    down, into the guide cylinder and glued in place.

Caution: The mini-compound detonator is a sensitive and extremely powerful
detonator and should be handled carefully at all times.

5.  Fill the remaining space in the shotshell case with any homemade high
    explosive in this manual.

Note: When using potassium chlorate or ammonium nitrate for a base explosive,
load the shotshell case with either base explosive.  When ready to use, simply
pour in the liquid activator of either nitromethane/nitrobenzene.

6.  After the top of the shotshell has been resealed, tape a 3/8" steel ball 
    bearing in place over the center of the primer in the base of the shell.

7.  Cloth streamers (12" x 1/2") are then taped in place around the shotshell.
    These streamers lend stability in flight and insure bottom base impact with
    the ground.

8.  As a further refinement, nails can be taped around the shotshell case
    with ntches, spaced 1/4" apart, down the length of the shell.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a grenade, simply throw into the target area.

2.  To use as a boobytrap, do not attach streamers or the ball bearing.  
    Simply insert the shotshell case into the target area.

Platter Charge                                              Sec. II, No. 15

An extremely effective directional charge can be made from a steel pipe cap, 
any high explosive, and a tin can.  This charge is effective against such
targets as transformers, generators, fuel storage containers and vehicles.  It
can be fired horizontally or used as an improvised land mine and fired
vertically.

Materials
---------

Steel pipe cap with a diameter between 1" and 24"

Tin can or other similar container with an inside diameter being the same as 
the steel pipe cap

sheet of wood 1" thick

steel pipe cap, (between 1 - 2" in diameter) and a piece of pipe, (approx. 2" 
in length

drill with 1/4" bit

Solid or liquid high explosive, i.e., nitromethane/ammonium nitrate explosive
(Sec. I, No. 34), fertilizer/hydrazine explosive (Sec. I, No. 36), or
nitromethane liquid explosive (Sec. I, No. 35)

blasting cap


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a steel pipe cap.  An ideal diameter would be 6 - 12".  However, 
    pipe caps as small as 1" may be used.

2.  Locate a coffee can or similar container with an inside diameter the same 
    as the outside diameter of the pipe cap.  Remove the lid (do not throw 
    away) and empty the contents of the can and clean it out.

3.  Place the pipe cap in the bottom of the can with the concave side 
    facing the bottom of the can.
        
4.  An exact center priming disk must be made from a 1" thick piece of wood in
    the following manner:

    A.  Using the coffee can lid from step 2 as a template, place it on a 
        sheet of wood 1" thick and mark the outside diameter with a pencil.

    B.  Using a saw, cut the disk out of the sheet of wood.  After cutting
        the disk out, drill a 1/4" hole through the exact center.  If this
        priming disk is to be used as a packing tool for the solid explosive,
        center sink the 1/4" center hole to fit the head of a 1/4" bolt.  
        Set the disk aside for later use.

5.  If a solid explosive is being used. the following constructon technique
    should be used:

    A.  Using the center priming disk prepared from step 4, a uniform packing
        tool can be prepared by the addition of a 1/4" nut and bolt, a steel
        pipe cap and a piece of pipe.

    B.  Carefully pack an amount of solid explosive equal to the weight of
        the pipe cap around and behind the pipe cap using the packing tool.
        For example, if the pipe cap weighs five pounds, use five pounds of
        solid explosive.

Note: For this charge to be effective, it is necessary to uniformly pack the
explosive behind the pipe cap with no air gaps.

    C.  After the explosive has been loaded into the tin can behind the 
        inverted pipe cap, disassemble the packing tool and place the priming
        disk over the ompressed explosive.  Seal the inside edges with glue,
        wax, or tar.  The discarded pipe handle and cap can be used later to 
        form a pipe hand grenade (Sec. II, No. 1)

Note: The wood priming disk prepared in step 4 has three ain uses: as a packing
tool for solid explosive, as a lid to keep the explosve from falling out of the
conainer, and as a template that insures exact rear center priming of the
charge.

    D.  After the priming disk has been sealed in place, insert a blasting cap
        through the center hole and into the solid explosive to a depth of
        3/4".  Seal around the cap with glue, wax or tar.

6.  When using a liquid explosive, an easier construction method may be
    used:

    A.  When ready to use, simply pour in an amount of liquid exlosive equal
        to the weight of the pipe cap and seal in place the wood priming disk
        prepared instep 4.

    B.  Insert a blasting cap through the center hole and into the liquid 
        explosive to a depth of 3/4".  Seal around the blasting cap with 
        glue, wax, or tar.

7.  If a coffee can was used in the construction, there should still be 
    sufficient room inside the can for a fuzing mechanism, i.e., a wrist
    watch delay timer with battery (Sec. VI, No. 4), or a small remote
    control radio reciever.

fizing mechanism, sealing around the edges of the disk and then pouring coffee
into the can until full.  Place the plastic sealing lid over the top of the can
to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  The unique capability of this charge is that it can be fired through a
    chain link fence and into its target without any loss of effectiveness.
    At close range the platter will penetrate about one inch of mild steel
    plate.  It is effective at ranges up to 100 feet or more, although at
    this distance penetration is reduced to about 1/4" of mild steel at best
    and sighting becomes a problem unless the target is a very large one.

2.  Upon detonation, the platter is projected forward at tremendous velocity.
    The air in front of the platter is compressed and becomes superheated.  It
    is this mass of air, moving at extremely high velovity, that first 
    penetrates the target.  The platter follows and may indeed strike the
    target, but research has shown that the primary destruction effect is
    created by the compacted high velocity air column.





SCIMP (Special Charge Improvised Projectile) charge         Sec. II, No. 16

Using materials that are readily available in its construction, this mine will
defeat almost any target that is mad-made, i.e., tanks, armored cars, 
buildings, etc.  This charge is four times for effective than any other
directional charge, to include shaped and platter charges.  This directional
charge utilizes two special techniques to achieve its effectiveness; one is
sandwiching an explosive charge between two steel plates, and the other 
involves detonating this charge from all sides at the same time (periphreal
detonation).

Materials
---------

oil filter cap or other similar steel dish

No. 6 sheet metal screws, 1" long

steel plate, 1/8" thick

Solid or liquid high explosive, i.e., fertilizer/nitromethane,
fertilizer/hydrazine liquid explosive, and nitromethane liquid explosive

wood or styrofoam sheets, 1" thick

blasting cap

coffee can or other similar container

drill with 1/4" bit


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a concave steel dish, 3" to 12" in diameter: for example, by 
    removing the center retaining bolt from any two piece oil filter assy.
    and using the oil filter cap (an oil filter from a 1951-53 chevy, with
    a diameter of 5 1/4" is ideal).

2.  Plug the bolt hole in the center of the cap with wood, rubber, or cork
    stopper.

3.  Using the oil filter cap as a template, place it on a sheet of steel 
    1/8" thick and mark the outside diameter with a pencil.

4.  Using a hacksaw, cut the disk out of the plate.

5.  Repear steps 3 and 4, cutting out two disks from a 1" thick sheet of wood
    or styrofoam.

6.  Take the three disks (one steel and the other two wood or styrofoam) and
    glue them together with the steel disk on one side.  Set aside for later 
    use.

7.  Locate a coddee can or similar container with an inside diameter 1/4" to 
    1/2" larger that the outside diameter of the filter ca.  Remove the lid 
    (do not throw away) and empty and clean the can.

8.  Using the coffee can lid as a template, repeat steps 3 and 4 on a 1"
    thick sheet of wood, and after cutting the disk out, drill a 1/4" hole
    in the exact center and set aside for later use.

9.  Place the oil can filter cap in the bottom center of the coffee can
    and glue in place with the concave cap facing towards the bottom of the
    cap.

                 |-------------------------------|   


10. If a solid explosive is being used, the following construction
    technique should be used:

    A.  Mark two rings around the inside of the coffee can; one 3" from the
        bottom of the can, and the second 5 5/8" from the bottom of the can.

    B.  Carefully pack the explosive uniformly around the filter cap until
        it reaches the 3" mark inside the can.

Note: The 1" thick wood disk prepared from step 8 can be used as a uniform
packing tool by attaching an improvised handle using a piece of pipe, two pipe
caps and a 1/4" nut and bolt.

    C.  After reaching the 3" mark inside the can, place the three later disk
        assy. (prepared in step 6) on top of the compressed explosive.  
        Center it with the steel disk on the explosive. 
    
    D.  Carefully pack the explosive between the inside edge of the can and
        the edge of the three layer disk assy. until the explosive level is
        even with the top of the disk.

    E.  Carefully pack an additional 1/2" layer of explosive on top of the 
        last styrofoam or wood disk.  This layer should reach the second ring 
        marked inside the can.

Note: Again the wood disk/pipe packing tool can be used to compress the
remaining explosive on top of the charge.

    F.  Disassemble the wood disk/pipe packing tool by removing the center nut
        and bolt that holds the two together.  Save and use the pipe for a 
        future pipe hand grenade (Sec. II, No. 1).

    G.  Place the 1" thick wood packing disk on top of the explosive contained
        inside the can and seal with glue, wax or tar.

    H.  When ready to use, insert a 1/4" blasting cap through the center hole
        in the wood disk and into the 1/2" layer of explosive.

Note: The wood disk prepared from step 8 has three main uses; a packing tool, a
lid to prevent the explosive from falling out of the container, and a template
that insures rear center priming of the charge.

11. When using a liquid explosive, a slightly different and easier 
    construction method is used:  

    A.  Mark two rings around the inside of the can; one 5 1/8" from the
        bottom of the can and the second 6 5/8 from the bottom of the can.

    B.  Place the top of the three layer disk assy. at the level of the first
        ring marked inside the can and secure in place with four No. 6 sheet
        metal screws spaced wvery 90 degrees around the outside of the coffee
        can and screwed into the center of the center disk assy.  Since the
        disk assy. is smaller than the inside diameter of the coffee can, it 
        can be held in place by inserting 1/4" wood dowels between the can and
        the assy.  When the four supporting screws have been screwed into
        place, the wooden dowels can be removed.

    C.  Place the remaining 1" thick wood disk, prepared from step 8, at
        the level of the second ring marked inside the can and secure
        in place with four more No. 6 sheet metal screws spaced every 90
        degrees around the outside of the can.  Seal the inside edges with
        wax, glue or tar.

    D.  When ready to use, simply pour the liquid explosive through the
        center hole until fill.  Insert a blasting cap through the hole and
        into the 1/2" layer of liquid explosive.  Seal around the hole and
        blasting cap with glue, wax, or tar.

12. If a coffee can was used in the construction, there should still be
    sufficient room inside the can for a fuzing mechanism, i.e., a watch
    delay timer with batteries (Sec. IV, No. 4), or a small remote control
    radio reciever.

13. After the fuzing mechanism has been inserted, the original metal lid
    that was removed and set aside ealier is now glued inside the plastic
    sealing lid that comes with most coffee cans and snapped back in place 
    on top of the can.  The whole charge then resembles an ordinary coffee can.

Note: A second disguise can be achieved by inserting a third disk covering the
fuzing mechanism, sealing around the edges of the disk and the pouring coffee
back into the can until full.  Place the plastic sealing lid over the top of 
the can to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  The SCIMP charge should be used when direct access to the target it not
    possible, i.e., under or beside a roadway or hanging on a fence looking
    into the target area.

2.  The applications are very similar to a platter charge with the exception
    that the SCIMP charge has far greater penetration ability of hard targets 
    at long distances than does the platter charge.  The SCIMP charge 
    described here can penetrate 1" thick steel at 50 years.

Note: The SCIMP charge relies on a super-heated, rod-like projectile traveling
at ultra high velocity to destroy its target.

Typist Note: I, the Mad Cracker, am not going to type every damn picture in the
book.  If you would like to build a "pipe pistol" I suggest you buy the books.
Unless you totally understand the instructions, I would not consider to attempt
these without pictures, as they are dangerous enough when done with the
pictures.
                                                            


Pipe Pistol for 9mm Ammunition                              Sec. III, No. 1

A 9mm pistol can be made from 1/4" steel, gas or water pipe and fittings.

Materials
---------

1/4" nominal size water pipe, 4-6 inches long with threaded ends

1/4"solid pipe plug

Two (2) steel pipe couplings

Metal strap, roughly 1/8" x 1/4" x 5"

Two (2) elastic bands

Flat head nail, 6D or 8D (approx. 1/16" in diameter)

Two (2) wood screws #8

wood 8" x5" x 1"                                

drill

1/4" wood or metal rod, approx. 8" long


Procedure
---------

1.  Carefully inspect pipe and fittings.

    A.  Make sure that there are NO cracks or other flaws in the pipe or
        fittings.

    B.  Check inside diameter of pipe using a 9mm cartridge as a gauge.  The
        bullet should closely fit into the pipe without forcing but the 
        cartridge case SHOULD NOT fit into pipe.

    C.  Outside diameter of pipe MUST NOT be less that 1 1/2 times bullet
        diameter (.536 in; 1.37 cm)

2.  Drill a 9/16" diameter hole 3/8" into one coupling to remove the thread.

Note: Drilled section should fit tightly over smooth section of the pipe.

3.  Drill a 25/64" diameter hole 3/4" into pipe.  Use cartridge as a gauge;
    when cartridge is inserted into the pipe, the base of the case should 
    be even with the end of the pipe.  Thread coupling tightly onto pipe, 
    drilled end first.

4.  Drill a hole in the center of the pipe plug just large enough for the
    nail to fit through.

Note: THE HOLE MUST BE CENTERED IN PLUG.

5.  Push nail through plug until head of nail is flush with square end.  Cut
    nail off at other end 1/16" away from plug.  Round off end of nail wih
    file.

6.  Bend metal strap to "U" shape and drill holes for wood screws.  File two
    small notches at top.     
        
7.  Saw or otherwise shape 1" thick hardwood into stock.

       -    ---------------- 
        

8.  Drll a 9/16" diameter hole through the stock.  The center of the hole
    should be approx. 1/2" from the top.

9.  Slide the pipe through this hole and attach front coupling.

Note: If 9/16" drill is not available, cut a "V" groove in the top of the stock
and tape pipe securely in place.

10. Position metal strap on stock so that top will hit the head of the nail.  
    Attach to stock with wood screws on each side.

11. String elastic bands from front coupling to notch on each side of the 
    strap.

SAFETY CHECK- TEST FIRE PISTOL BEFORE HAND FIRING

1.  Locate a barrier such as a stone wall or large tree which you can stand 
    behid in case the pistol ruptures when fired.

2.  Mount pistol solidly to a table or other rigid support at least ten feet
    in front of the barrier.

3.  Attach a cord to the firing strap on the pistol.

4.  Holing the other end of the cord, go behind the barrier.

5.  Pull cord so that the firing strap is held back.

6.  Release the cord to fire the pistol.  (If pistol does not fire, shorten
    the elastic bands or increase their number)

Note: Fire at least five rounds behind the barrier and then re-inspect the
pistol be
