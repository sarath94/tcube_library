Cherry Bomb Flechette gun                                   Sec. III, No. 14

Typist note: In the Black book III, the .22 pistol is done again.  Since the 
two are almost identical and therefore, the second one has not be typed and
presented here.  That is the reason for this section being No. 14, instead of
No. 13.

A highly effective, hand held shotgun can be made from 3/4 in. water pipe and
the projectiles are homemade flechettes (steel darts) made from box nails.  
This shotgun uses cherry bombs as a source of propellant and can achieve muzzle
velocities as high as 1300 feet per second.  The effective range is appox. 50
yards.

Materials
---------

3/4 in. diameter water pipe, 12 inches long

3/4 in. pipe coupler and pipe plug

box nails between 1 in. and 1 1/2 in. long

short piece of 3/4 in. water pipe, approx 2 in. long

rubber from inner tube

cork from wine bottle

plaster of paris

hammer and drill with 1/8 in. bit

cherry bombs or homemade flash powder


Procedure
---------

1.  Flechette rounds can be made in the following manner:
    
    A.  Flatten the heads of box nails with a hammer.

    B.  Pour plaster of paris into a mold made from a short section of 3/4 in.
        water pipe, to a depth of 3/8 in.

    C.  Insert the nails, fins down, into this mold and allow the plaster of
        paris to harden. (approx. 20 minutes)

    D.  Push the flechette round out of the mold and set aside for later use.

2.  For every flechette round that is prepared, a gas seal spacer has to also
    be prepared in the following manner:

    A.  Using the short section of 3/4 in. water pipe as a die, sharpen the 
        edges with a file and hammer out circular pieces from a rubber inner
        tube.

    B.  Using a razor blade, cut a 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cord into 
        1/2 in. sections.

    C.  Attach the rubber gas seal to the cork spacer with a thumb tack.

3.  The shotgun may be prepared in the following manner:

    A.  Drill a 1/8 in. diameter hole through the center of a 3/4 in. pipe
        plug, then screw the pipe plug into a 3/4 in. pipe coupler.

    B.  Screw this pipe coupler assy. onto one end of a 12 inch long piece
        of 3/4 in. water pipe.


How To Use
----------

1.  Unscrew the pipe coupler assy. from the end of the pipe.

2.  Insert the flechette round into the pipe.

3.  Insert the gas seal spacer assy. behind the flechette round.

4.  Insert a cherry bomb into the pipe coupler assy. with the fuse protruding
    from the rear of the pipe plug.

5.  Screw the coupling assy. onto the pipe and ignite the fuse.

Note: Gloves should be worn if this weapon is to be hand fired.  With 
sufficient practice, it can be fired, broken down, reloaded and fired again in 
a reasonably short period of time.

A second application is to fire it electrically.

By using an electric bulb initiator (Sec. IV, No. 1) and filling the bulb with
the contents of a cherry bomb, this weapon can be used as an effective booby
trap to cover a trail or other type of passageway.  It can still be hand fired
by means of a hand held battery pack and switch arrangment.

If cherry bombs are not available, the following flash powders can be
substituted:

1.  4 parts by weight of potassium perchlorate
    1 part by weight of antimony sulfide
    1 part by weight aluminum powder

2.  3 parts by weight of potassium permanganate
    2 parts by weight of aluminum powder

3.  4 parts by weight of potassium chlorate
    1 part by weight of sulfur
    1 part by weight of aluminum powder

The fist mixture is standard cherry bomb powder and should be used whenever
possible.

The second mixture is an excellent substitute for the first and is relatively
safe to handle.

The third mixture is extremely shock sensitive and should only be used as a 
last resort.

To use these mixtures, separately pulverize each ingredient into a fine powder.
 Add these powder ingredients to a canning jar or other similar container with 
a tight fitting lid.  Mix thoroughly by gently tumbling the container between
the hands of a period of five minutes.  Add one gram (approx. 1 teaspoon) to an
electric bulb initiator when ready to use.

    leads out one end of pipe.

3.  Stuff a rag wad into each end of pipe and lightly tamp using a flat end
    stick.

4.  Insert stones and/or scrap metal into each end of pipe.  Be sure the
    same weight of material is used on each side.

5.  Insert a rag wad into each end of the pipe and pack tightly as before.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place scrap mine in a tree or pointed in the path of the enemy.  Attach
    igniter lead to the firing circuit.  The recoilless launcher is ready to
    fire.

2.  If safety or improvised fuse is used instead of the detonator, place the
    fuse into thepackaged propellant through a hole drilled in the center of
    the pipe.  Light free end of fuse when ready to fire.  Allow for normal
    delay time.

Caution: Scrap will be ejected from both ends of the pipe.

        ":" (space between) is rebber disk
        "|+|" is a washer
        "|-|" is a wooden stick

Note: Gun barrel is slightly less than 3/4 in. in diameter.  If rubber disk 
does not fit in barrel, file or trim it very slightly.  It should fit tightly.

3.  Drill a hole through the center of one wooden block of such size that the
    push rod will fit tightly.  Whittle a depression around the hole on one 
    side approx. 1/8 in. and large enough for the grenade to rest in.

4.  Place the base of the grenade in the wooden block.  Securely fasten grenade
    to block by wrapping tape (or wire) around entire grenade and block.

Note: Be sure that the tape or wire does not cover hole in block or interfere
with the operation of the grenade or safety lever.

5.  Drill hole through the center of the second wooden block, so that it
    will just slide over the outside of the gun barrel.

This diamgram (hmpf!) represents the can, a wood block at the bottom, and nails
holding the block on (they are to be bent over).

8.  Slide the can and block onto the barrel until muzzle passes the can's open
    end.  Wrap a small piece of tape around the barrel an inch or two from the
    end.  Tightly wrapped string may be used instead of tape.  Force the can
    and wooden block forward against the tape so that they are securely held in
    place.  Wrap tape around the barrel behind the can.

Caution: Be sure that the can is securely fastened to the gun barrel.  If the
can should become looses and slip down the barrel after the launcher is
assembled, the grenade will explode aftr the egular delay time.

9.  Remove crimp from a 12 gauge shotgun shell with pen knife.  Open cartridge.
    Pour shot from shell.  Remove wads and plastic liner, if present.

10. Empty the propellant onto a piece of paper.  Using a knife, divide the
    propellant in half.  Replace half of the propellant into the cartridge
    case.

11. Replace the 12 gauge cardboard wads into cartridge case.

Note: If wads are not available, stuff tissue paper or cotton into the 
cartridge case.  Pack tighly.


How to Use
----------

4.  Load cartridge in gun.

CAUTION: Do not tilt muzzle downward.

2.  Hold gun against ground at 45 degree angle and light fuse.

Note: Steps 1 and 2, "How to Use" same for both standard and improvised
shotguns.

CAUTION: Severe burns may result if bottle shatters when fired.  If possible,
obtain a bottle identical to that being used as the fire bottle.  Fill about 
2/3 full of water and fire as above.  If bottle shatters when fired instead of
being launched intact, use a different type of bottle.





Grenade Launchers                                           Sec. IV, No. 5

    "+" is nut
    ":" is bolt


4.  Screw end cap onto pipe tightly.  Tube is now ready for use.


How to Use
----------

1.  Bury launching tube in ground at desired angle so that bottom of tube is at
    least 2 ft. underground.  Adjust the number of increments in rear finned 
    end of mortat projectile.  See following table (shit) for launching angle 
    and number of increments used.

2.  When ready to fire, withdraw safety wire from mortar projectile.  Drop
    projectile into launching tube, FINNED END FIRST. (yes, several assholes
    in the ARMY have actually put one down head first....BOOM! They ain't with 
    us no more...) 
    
CAUTION: Be sure bore riding pin is in place when mortar projectile is dropped
into tube.  A live mortar round could explode in the tube if ithe fit is loose
enough to permit the bore riding pin to come out partway.  Also keep all body
arts behind open end of tube when firing, as the mortar will fire once dropped
down the tube.

Silent grenade launcher                                     Sec. IV, No. 7
                                                            
A completely silent grenade launcher can be made from a 12 gauge shotgun shell,
pieces of pipe, pipe resucer, wooden dowels and a wine bottle cork.  This
produces a launcher that can propel a fire bottle in excess of 100 yards and a
grenade in excess of 300 yards.  After firing, all of the expanding gas in
contained within the barrel.  This principle of gas containment produces a
completely silent weapon.

Materials
---------

12 gauge shotgun shells

launcher parts:

    3/4 in. nominal size water or gas pipe, 30 in. long and threaded on both
    ends

    3/4 in. steel pipe coupler

    3/4 in. steel pipe plug

    sheet of wood 2 in. x 4 in. x 32 in.

    metal strap 1/4 in. x 1/16 in. x 4 in.

    heavy twine (approx. 100 yards)

    3 wood screws and screwdriver

    flat head nail (8D) for firing and safety pins

    saw, file and drill with assortment of bits

    shellac or lacquer

    rubber bands


Gas containment parts:

    3/4 in. to 1/2 in. steel pipe reducer

    3/4 in. diameter, 1 1/2 in. long hard wooden dowel

    3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cork

    rubber disk 3/4 in. in diameter and 1/4 in. thick (leather or neoprene can
    be used in place of the rubber disk)

    vaseline


Launching platfirm parts:

    hard wooden dowel 30 in. long x 1/2 in. in diameter

    tin can to fit over fire bottle or hand grenade

    wood platfirm base approx. 3 in. x 3 in. x 2 in. to which tin can and
    wooden dowel will be mounted

    nuts and bolts, or nails, at least 2 1/2 in. long


Procedure
---------

1.  Carefully inspect pipe and fittings:

    A.  Make sure there are no cracks or other flaws.

    B.  Check inside diameter of pipe.  A 12 gauge shotgun shell should fit
        into the pipe but the brass rim of the shell should not.

    C.  Outside diameter of the pipe must be at least 1 in.

    D.  Screw the 3/4 in. - 1/2 in. pipe resucer onto the front end of the 
        pipe.  Sighting through the rear end of the pipe, ensure that the 
        reduced 1/2 in. center hole is centered with respect to the side 
        walls of the 3/4 in. pipe.  Remove the pipe reducer and set aside
        for later use.

CAUTION: Do not use a pipe reducer that causes an offset center hole when it is
tightened down on the end of the pipe.

2.  Cut stock from wood using a saw:

    | <-                approx. 32 in.                   -> |
    | <-    13 1/2 in.    -> |

n|_ |_____________________________-----------
        

3.  Cut 3/8 in. deep "V" groove int he top of the stock.

4.  Turn the 3/4 in. pipe coupling onto the rear of the pipe.

5.  Coat pipe and "V" groove of stock with shellac or lacquer and while still
    wet, place pipe in "V" groove and wrap pipe and stock together using two
    heavy layers of twine.  Coat twine with shellac or lacquer after each 
    layer.

6.  Using a metal file, file the threaded end of the pipe plug flat.  This
    allows a firm seat between the rear of the shotshell case and the end of
    the pipe plug.  However, because of tapered screw threads on the pipe and
    pipe plug, the pipe coupler my prevent firm seating between the shotshell 
    case and the pipe plug.  If this is the case, fill the space between the
    pipe plug and the shotshell case with 1 in. steel washers with holes in
    the center of the firing pin to pass through.

7.  Drill a hole through the center of the pipe plug large enough for a 8D
    nail to pass through.

8.  Using the same size drill, drill a hole through  the rear side of the
    pipe plug, perpendicular to and intersecting witht he central firing pin
    hole.  This is going to be used as a safety for the firing pin.

9.  Push an 8D nail through the central firing pin hole and cut off flat
    1/32 in. past the end of the pipe plug or the end of the last 1 in. steel
    washer.

10. Using a file, notch the firing pin nail where the side hole intersects
    with the central firing pin hole and file the end round.

11. Using a serparate 8D nail, push it through the side hole.  Note where
    it intersents the firing pin hole and file it flat, to half its normal
    thickness, from that point until it passes through the other side.

12. Insert the firing pin into the central firing pin hole, aligning the slot
    in the firing pin with he safety hole in the side of the pipe plug.

13. Insert the safety nail through the side hole so that it interlocks with
    the central firing pin.  Bend the protruding end of the safety nail 
    around the end pipe plug to ensure that the firing pin is locked into
    place.

14. Insert steel washers, if necessary, and screw end plug tightly into pipe
    coupler.

15. Bend a 4 in. metal strap into an "L" shape and drill a hole for the side
    pivot screw to pass through.  Notch the metal strap on the long side, 1/2
    in. from the bend.

16. Position the metal strap on the stock sp that the top will hit the head of
    the nail.  Attach to the stock using a wood pivot screw.

17. Place a screw on each side of the stock about 4 in. in front of the metal 
    strap.  Pass rubber bands through the notch in the metal strap and attach
    to screw on each side of the stock.

18. Two gas containment pistons should be made in the following manner:

    A.  Cut a 3/4 in. diameter wood dowel to a length of 1 1/2 in.  Round the
        forward edges of the dowel off with file.

    B.  Attach a 3/4 in. diameter, 1/4 in. thick rubber or leather washer
        to the rearend of the wooden dowel with a thumb tack.  If rubber
        or leather of the proper thickness is not available, the washer
        can be built up to 1/4 in. thick with successive layers of thin
        rubber or leather.

    C.  Cut a 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cork to a length of 1 1/2 in.
    
    D.  Set both pistons aside for later use.

19. A launching platform should be made in the following manner:

    A.  Drill a 1/2 in. hole approx. 1 in. deep in the center of the wood
        block.  The 1/2 in. diameter, 30 in. long hard wooden dowel is to
        fir into this hole.

    B.  Drill two 1/4 in. holes on opposite sides of the wooden support
        block.  These holes should be drilled clear through the block for
        bolts to pass through.

    C.  Using the supporting block as a template, mark the bolt holes on the 
        bottom of a tin can which is large enought to hold either a fire
        bottle or hand grenade, then drill the two holes in the bottom of the
        can.  Secure the can to the supporting block by placing 1/4 in. bolts
        through the bottom of the can and the block, securing with nuts.

    D.  Push the 30 in. long, 1/2 in. diameter wooden dowel into the 1 in.
        deep hole in the bottom of the supporting block.  Secure in place
        by driving a nail through the supporting block and into the center
        of the wooden dowel.

20. Prepare a 12 gauge shotgun shell in the following manner:

    A.  Remove crimp from the shell with a pen knife.  Pour shot from shell
        and remove the wads and plastic liner if present.

    B.  Empty the propellant onto a folded piece of paper.  Divide the 
        propellant into thirds.  Replace 2/3 of the propellant back into
        the shell case.

    C.  Replace the 12 gauge cardboard wads back into the shell casing.  If
        wads are not available, stuff tissue paper or cotton into the shell 
        case and pack tightly.


How to Use
----------

1.  To load:

    A.  Remoove the firing pin plug from the rear of the pipe coupler.

    B.  Insert the specially loaded 12 gauge shotgun into the rear end of
        the pipe.

    C.  Insert steel washers if necessary and screw the pipe plug back into

glass bottle with stopper (1 qt. approx.)

small bottle or jar with lid

rag or absorbent paper (paper towels, newpaper)

string or rubber bands


Procedure
---------

1.  Sulfuric acid must be concentrated.  If battery acid or other dilute
    acid is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are
    given off.  Container should be oven glass or enamel-ware.

CAUTION: Sulfuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is spilled,
wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also dangerous and
should not be inhaled.

2.  Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.

3.  Pour gasoline into the large (1 qt.) bottle until it is approx. 2/3 full.

4.  Add concentrated sulfuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle
    is filled to within 1 to 2 in. from the top.  Place the stopper in the
    mouth of the bottle.

5.  Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION: If this is NOT done, the bottle may be dangerous to handle during use.

6.  Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside 
    of the bottle.  Tie with string ot fasten with rubber bands.

7.  Dissolve 1/2 cup of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup of sugar in one cup of
    boiling water.

8.  Allow the solution to cool, pout into the small bottle and cap slightly.

CAUTION: Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.


How to Use
----------

1.  Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
    around the large bottle.

Bottle can be used wet or after solution has dried.  However, when dry, the
sugar-Potassium nitrate mixture is very sensitive to spark or flame and should
be handled accordingly.  

2.  Throw ot launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard 
    surface (target) the acid in the gasoline will react with the chlorate-
    sugar mixture annd then ignite the gasoline.




Igniter from book matches                                   Sec. V, No. 2

This is a hot igniter made from paper book matches for use with molotov
cocktails and other incendiaries.

Materials
---------

paper book matches

adhesive or friction tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Remove the staple(s) from match book and separate matches from cover.

2.  Fold and tape one row of matches.

3.  Shape the cover into a tube with striking surface on the inside and tape.
    Make sure the folded cover will fit tightly around the taped match heads.
    Leave cover open at opposite end for insertion of the matches.

4.  Push the taped matches into the tube until the bottom ends are exposed 
    about 3.4 in.

5.  Flatten and fold the open end of the tube so that it laps over about 1 in,;
    tape in place.


Use with Molotov Cocktail
-------------------------

Tap the "match end tab" of the igniter to the neck of the molotov cocktail.

Grasp the "cover end tab" and pull sharply or quickly to ignite.


General Use
-----------

The book match igniter can be used by itself to ignite flammable liquids, fuse
cords, and other similar items requiring hot ignition.

CAUTION: Store matches and completed igniters in moistureproof containers such
as rubber or plastic bags until ready for use.  Damp or wet paper book matches
will not ignite.




Mechanically Initiated fire bottle                          Sec. V, No. 3

The mechanically initiated fire bottle is an incendiary device which ignites when thrown against a hard surface.

Materials
---------

glass jar or short neck bottle with a leakproof lid or stopper

tin can or similar container just large enough to fit over the lid of the jar

coil spring (compression) approx. 1/2 the diameter of the can and 1 1/2 times 
as long

gasoline

four (4) "blue tip" matches (I think they are called Ohio kitchen matches)

flat stick or piece of metal roughly 1/2 in. x 1/16 in. x 4 in.

wire or heavy twine

adhesive tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Draw or scratch two lines around the can- one 3/4 in. and the other 1 1/4
    in. from the open end.

2.  Cut 2 slots on opposite sides of the tin can at the line farthest from
    the open end.  Make slots large enough for the flat stick or piece
    of metal to pass through.

3.  Punch 2 small holes just below the rim of the open end of the can.

4.  Tape blue tip matches together in pairs.  The distance between the match
    heads should equal the inside diameter of the can.  Two pairs are
    sufficient.  

5.  Attach paired matches to second and third coils of the spring, using thin
    wire.

6.  Insert the end of the spring opposite the matches into the tin can.

7.  Compress the spring until the end with the matches passes the slot in the
    can.  Pass the flat stick or piece of metal through slots in can to hold
    spring in place.  This acts as a safety device.

8.  Puch many closely packed small holes between the lines marked on the can
    to form a striking surface for the matches.  Be careful to not seriously
    deform the can.

9.  Fill the jar with gasoline and cap tightly.

10. Turn can over and place over the jar so that the safety stick rests on
    the lid of the jar.

11. Pass wire or twine around the bottom of the jar.  Thread ends through
    the holes in can and bind tightly to jar.

12. Tape wire or cord to jar near the bottom.


How to Use
----------

1.  Carefully withdraw flat safety stick.

2.  Throw jar at hard surface.

CAUTION: DO NOT REMOVE SAFETY STICK UNTIL READY TO THROW FIRE BOTTLE.  The
safety stick, when in place, prevents ignition of the fire bottle if it should
accidently be broken.




Gelled flame Fuels                                          Sec. V, No. 4

Gelled or paste type fuels are often preferable to raw gasoline for use in
incediary devices such as fire bottles.  This type fuel adheres more readily to
the target and produces greater heat concentration.

Several methods are shown for gelling gasoline using commonly avilable
materials.  The methods are divided into the following catagories based on the
major ingredient:

        4.1  Lye systems
        4.2  Lye-alcohol
        4.3  Soap-alcohol systems
        4.4  Egg white systems
        4.5  Latex systems
        4.6  Wax systems
        4.7  Animal blood systems


I will type this one warning ONE TIME only! 

CAUTION: Never at ANY time should you light up a cigarette while mixing flame
fuels!  No Smoking!  Go smokeless!


Lye Systems                                                 Sec. V, No. 4.1       
Lye (also known as caustic soda or Sodium hydroxide) can be used in combination
with powdered rosin ot castor oil to gel gasoline for use as a flame fuel which
will adhere to target surfaces.

Note: This fuel is not suitable for use in the chemical (sulfuric acid) type of
fire bottle (Sec. V, No. 1).  The acid will react with the lye and break down
the gel.

Procedure
--------- 

1.  Obtaining wax from Natural sources:  Plants and berries are potential
    sources of natural waxes.  Place the plants and/or berries in boiling 
    water.  The natural waxes will melt.  Let the water cool.  The natural
    waxes will form a solid layer on the water surface.  Skim off the solid
    wax and let dry.  With natural waxes which has suspended matter when 
    melted, screen the wax through a cloth.

2.  Melt the wax and pour into jar or bottle which has been placed in a hot 
    water bath.

3.  Add gasoline to the bottle.

4.  When wax has completely dissolved in the gasoline, allow the water bath to
    cool slowly to room temp. 

Note: If a gel does not form, add additional wax, (up to 40 % by volume) and
repeat the above steps.  if no gel forms with 40 % wax,, make a lye solution by
dissolving a small amount of lye (sodium hydroxide) in a equal amount of water.
Add this solution (1/2% by volume) to the gasoline wax mix and shake bottle
until get forms.
