PROCEDURE:                
----------
1.  PLACE ALCOHOL IN ONE OF THE 
BUCKETS.

2.  PLACE POTASSIUM NITRATE, 
CHARCOAL, AND SULFUR IN THE HEAT 
RESISTANT BUCKET.  ADD 1 CUP WATER 
AND MIX THOROUGHLY WITH WOODEN STICK 
UNTIL ALL INGREDIENTS ARE DISSOLVED.
                   
3.  ADD REMAINING WATER (2 CUPS) TO 
MIXTURE.  PLACE BUCKET ON HEAT 
SOURCE AND STIR UNTIL SMALL BUBBLES 
BEGIN TO FORM.

CAUTION:  DO NOT BOIL MIXTURE.  BE 
SURE ALL MIXTURE STAYS WET.  IF ANY 
IS DRY, AS ON SIDES OF PAN, IT MAY 
IGNITE.

4.  REMOVE BUCKET FROM HEAT AND POUR 
MIXTURE INTO ALCOHOL WHILE STIRRING 
VIGOROUSLY.

5.  LET ALCOHOL MIXTURE STAND ABOUT 
5 MINUTES.  STRAIN MIXTURE THROUGH 
CLOTH TO OBTAIN BLACK POWDER.  
DISCARD LIQUID.  WRAP CLOTH AROUND 
BLACK POWDER AND SQUEEZE TO REMOVE 
ALL EXCESS LIQUID.

6.  PLACE SCREENING OVER DRY BUCKET. 
 PLACE WORKABLE AMOUNT OF DAMP 
POWDER ON SCREEN AND GRANULATE BY 
RUBBING SOLID THROUGH SCREEN.

NOTE:  IF GRANULATED PARTICLES 
APPEAR TO STICK TOGETHER AND CHANGE 
SHAPE, RECOMBINE ENTIRE BATCH OF 
POWDER AND REPEAT STEPS 5 AND 6.

7.  SPREAD GRANULATED BLACK POWDER 
ON FLAT DRY SURFACE SO THAT LAYER 
ABOUT 1/2 INCH IS FORMED.  ALLOW TO 
DRY.  USE RADIATOR, OR DIRECT 
SUNLIGHT.  THIS SHOULD BE DRIED AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY IN ONE 
HOUR.  THE LONGER THE DRYING PERIOD, 
THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE BLACK POWDER.

CAUTION:  REMOVE FROM HEAT AS SOON 
AS GRANULES ARE DRY.  BLACK POWDER 
IS NOW READY FOR USE!
