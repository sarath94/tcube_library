How To Make Blasting Gelatin
----------------------------
        One of the nearly perfect explosive compounds, in the sense of
chemical combustion rather than stability, is blasting gelatin. This was
discovered by Nobel, and is a very primitive form of plastique, as we know
it today. It is made by mixing a small amount of nitrocellulose (nitrated
sawdust) with a larger amount of nitroglycerin. This creates a stiff, plastic
substance which has power as an explosive greater than either of its
ingredients. A person attempting to make this should use 92% nitroglycerin
and 8% nitrocellulose, and pray. If you don't want to mess with making
nitrocellulose and have access to guncotton, it can be substituted. Any 
recipe listed in this chapter which employs unstable or sensitive compounds,
such as nitroglycerin, should be left alone by all those who do not have
access to a laboratory or previous training. This book (disk) is not enough
training to mess with these compounds.
