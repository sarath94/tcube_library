MSG LEFT BY: THE INSPECTOR

CONDENSATION IN A CAR'S TANK PUTS A LAYER OF WATER ON ITS BOTTOM. GELATIN
CAPSULES FILLED WITH ONE PART CALCIUM CARBIDE AND ONE PART PURE SODIUM ARE
DROPPED INTO A CAR'S GAS TANK.  IN A FEW MINUTES THERE IS AN EXPLOSION YOU 
HAVE TO SEE TO BELIEVE!
 
GELATIN CAPSULES, FILLED WITH MORE GELATIN ARE BOUGHT AT THE SUPERMARKET.
THE GELATIN IS EMPTIED FROM THE CAPSULES AND BB'S ARE PUT INTO THEM SO THEY
SINK TO THE BOTTOM.
SLIVERS OF METALLIC SODIUM AND CHUNKS OF CARBIDE ARE THEN PUT INTO THE CAPSULES
...CARRY THE CAPSULES IN A PLASTIC BAG TO KEEP THEM DRY.
 
 THREE OR FOUR CAPSULES ARE DROPPED INTO A CAR'S GAS TANK. SEVERAL MINUTES 
- HALF AN HOUR LATER....THE CAPSULES DISINTEGRATE AND THE MOISTURE TURNS
THE CARBIDE INTO EXPLOSIVE GAS AND ALSO IGNITES THE SODIUM.  THE BURNING SODIUM
IGNITES THE CARBIDE GAS THERE IS A:
