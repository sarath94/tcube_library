 home. These darts can travel a long distance with good penetration if
 constructed correctly.

 Materials needed:

 A small piece of wood
 A sewing machine needle
 A spool of thread
 A couple nails
 Hammer
 Glue
 Scissors

    Hammer the two nails about two inches apart on the board. Wrap the thread
 tightly around the two nails. The number of times the thread is wrapped aroun

 the nails will determine the amount of weight and stability the dart has. Onc

 you have decided you have wrapped enough thread, cut it close to the nail at
 around a half inch. Take this small tuft of thread and put a dab of glue on t
e
 folded end. The kind of glue you use is very important. I suggest that you us

 a tacky kind of glue (nothing runny, like Elmer's glue). Attach this to the
 needle and hold until it is dry.
    Another kind of dart can be made with Q-tips. This kind of dart doesn't wo
k
 as well as the first one, but it is sometimes easier to make. first you have
o
 get the kind of Q-tips that have a plastic stem. Cut the Q-tip close to one
 end. Insert the sewing needle into the Q-tip and secure it by melting the
 plastic slightly with a lighter. This kind of dart doesn't last long because
 the cotton come off easily.

 Blow Guns:

    Ordinary straws make an excellent blow gun with this kind of dart. Another
 kind can be made with a cheap pen by taking apart the pen and using the shell

 Any long, cylindrical, object with the diameter of a straw will work very wel

            PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS
           ------------------

Commonly known as "zip"  guns,  guns made from pipe have been used for years by
juvenile  punks.    Today's Militants make them just for the hell of it  or  to
shoot once in an assassination or riot and throw away if there is any danger of
apprehension.

They can be used many times but with some, a length of dowel is needed to force
out the spent shell.

There  are  many  variations  but  the illustration  shows  the  basic  design.

First,   a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for the barrel to rest  in.
The barrel is then taped securely to the stock with a good, strong tape.

The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is punched in the trigger flap
to  hold a roofing,  which is wired or soldered onto the flap.   The trigger is
bent and nailed to the stock on both sides.

The  pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas or water pipe with  a
bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from passing through
the pipe.

The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap,  with a hole bored through it, is
screwed  on.   Then the trigger is slowly released to let the nail pass through
the hole and rest on the primer.

To  fire,  the trigger is pulled back with the left hand and held back with the
thumb  of  the right hand.   The gun is then aimed and the thumb  releases  the
trigger and the thing actually fires.

Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in any hardware store.   All
caliber bullets, from the .22 to the .45 are used in such guns.

Some  zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested within each other.   For
instance, a .22 shell will fit snugly into a length of a car's copper gas line.
Unfortunatey,   the copper is too weak to withstand the pressure of the firing.
So the length of gas line is spread with glue and pushed into a wider length of
pipe.    This  is spread with glue and pushed into a length of steel pipe  with
threads and a cap.

Using this method,  you can accomodate any cartridge, even a rifle shell.   The
first  size  of  pipe for a rifle shell accomodates the  bullet.    The  second
accomodates its wider powder chamber.

A  12-gauge  shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel pipe.   If you  want  to
comply with the gun laws, the barrel should be at least eighteen inches long.

Its  firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol.   It naturally has  a
longer  stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt.   Also,  a  small
nail  is  driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in  the
front of the trigger.   The rubber band is put over one nail and brought around
the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

In  case  you actually make a zip gun,  you should test it before firing it  by
hand.   This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to where
it  will  do no damage.   Then a string is tied to the trigger and you  go  off
several yards.   The string is then pulled back and let go.  If the barrel does
not blow up, the gun is safe to fire by hand.

               You should not attempt to register such a gun.
