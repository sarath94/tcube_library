   This is a phile on how to make simple but efective blowguns that can be
shot 50 feet with a good powerful breath, easily concealed, and extremely
accurate if made right (I shit you not).

YOU WILL NEED:   1.   A large drinking straw
*************
                 2.   A few 2 inch needles

                 3.   A few pencil erasers

                 4.   Some scotch tape

                 5.   An X-Acto knife (or razor blade or scissors)


   The straw should have a fairly large opening. (so you can fit the dart in)
A Mcdonalds straw will work good and a 7-11 slurpee straw will work also, 
but you have to cut off that fucking useless spoon like thing at the end of
it.  Next you need to go to K-mart to steal a bunch of 2 inch needles.
You also need a bunch of pencil erasers (the ones at the end of a PENCIL
NOT those great big blocks of pink rubber)  Carefully take them out of the 
pencils without ripping them.  If the metal thing comes off with it remove
it and throw it out.  The eraser should be about 3/4 of a centimeter long. 
(cut it if it isn't)  Now put the eraser onto the the needle a centimeter 
down.  You should be able to drop it through the straw and not have it get
stuck. (If it does, get a smaller eraser or a fatter straw)  Ok, now to
make the fins.  Take some scotch tape (a centimeter wide; if it isn't cut it)
and fold it over itself and make some fins at the end of the needle with the
hole in it.  Trim the extra tape of so it easily slides through the straw.


                Your dart should look something like this:
     (tape)
           \        (eraser)
             \         | 
              }}-------##--
                    |
                    |
                (needle)


Now take a deep breath and put your dart in the end of the straw your mouth 
will go on and blow hard through the straw.  (Breathe in before you put the 
straw to your mouth: do NOT suck air in through the straw unless you have 
shit for brains or want a doctor removing a needle from the inside of your 
neck!  
   If it doesn't work JUST like you want it to, you might want to ajust the
dart by moving the eraser up and down the needle a little bit, or try redoing
the fins.  This usualy helps me.  Well, have phun doing what you want with it.
I don't care.
