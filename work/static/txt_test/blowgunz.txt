 I'm sick of seeing stupid little files on how to make portable blowguns by
 using a McDonald's straw or something. And darts made out of straight pins
 and yarn.  This is a file on how to make GOOD, Simple blowguns and
 Functional Long-Lasting Blowgun Darts. 

 You'll need:

  1. Two outer Casings of Bic Round Stic Pens 
  (The Pen minus the ball point, Ink cylindar, and black cap at the back.)

  2. A bunch of Packing tape (the real strong stuff) or Duck Tape.

 For the darts:

  1. A bunch of BIG needles.. The kind that are this: ------------------ 
     long or so.

  2. An equal bunch of Q-Tip Cotton swab plastic stick things.
     Make sure they are the kind with the HOLLOW PLASTIC Tube.
     Not the Cheap Shit Cardboard stick kind.

  3. Super Glue (Cyanoacrylate) and some kind of super glue accelerator:
     I used "Zip Kicker" or somethin'.
     You can do this without the accelerator.. But it's easier with it. 
     

  O.K. First, Take a Bic round Stic Pen and rip the black little cap thing 
  off the end and remove the ball point and ink thing. You should now be
  left with a round plastic tube. note.. You MUST use Bic Round Stick.. Not
  Bic Stic or the crystal breakable plastic pens.
  Now.. Take two of these pen-tubes and Tape them together TIGHTLY 
  end-to-end. Use a lot of tape.  YOU should now have 1 long AIRTIGHT tube.
  That's your blowgun. You could try taping three together to get a longer
  range.. But the differance is not much.
  Now that's a lot more sturdy and better blowgun than a flimsy McDonalds
  drinking straw!!

  Now the darts..
  First Take your Q-Tips and rip the cotton off one end.. ONE END ONLY!!
  Now.. dip the other end (with the cotton on it) into that pile of super
  glue that you spilled all over your desk.. (my.. how clumsy you are).
  Now that the cotton end of the q-tip is covered in glue.. Let it soak
  in for a second or two, and then spray it with yer accelerator stuff.
  (Notice how it completely dries in about 1 second??) Now you should
  have something like this:

                                               /------Plastic Tube(hollow)
  Glue soaked cotton end---->  (***)===============

  Good.. Now file/sand down the hard cotton/glue end until it just BARELY
  will fall through the tube with no resistance.
  This way, your breath will propel the dart further.
  Next..  Take yer (big) needle and stick it about halfway in the open end
  of the plastic, hollow, Q-Tip and glue it in so it can NEVER come out..
  (I mean a TIGHT fit!!!!) It should look like this now:


                  (***)===============------  <--The Needle


  Good.. Now make some more of these.
  You're Finished!!


  I have been able to shoot these darts over 50 feet!!
  Try coating the tip with poison..
  We Here at M.A.L.T. Prefer Dichlorovinyl Dimethyl Phosphate (DVDP)
  And remember.. Always put the dart in the side of the blowgun that
  you are blowing on.
  (Or the dart will go about 4 inches.)


  FUCK THE WORLD, ANARCHY RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!


  This has been a M.A.L.T. Production
  All Rights worth Shit!!
