Today's valuable lesson is on the vulnerable spots of the human body. Typically
the human body is divided into three killing regions. The head and neck, the
trunk, and the limbs. Below is a listing of the most vulnerable parts in each
region.

Head and Neck           Trunk                 Limbs
-------------           -----                 -----
a. eyes                 a. groin              a. instep of foot
b. nose                 b. solar plexus       b. ankle
c. adam's apple         c. spine              c. knee
d. temple               d. kidney             d. shoulder
e. side of neck         e. collar bone        e. elbow
f. nape                 f. floating ribs      f. wrist
g. upper lip            g. stomach            g. fingers
h. ears                 h. armpit
i. base of throat
j. chin


All the spots above are extremely sensitive to killing blows. A word of caution
these spots should only be attacked if you are intent on doing serious bodily
damage. Hell! if your reading this then you want to fuck someone over anyway.
Also, when practicing blows to these areas with a training partner be sure to
strike lightly until you master the maneuvers.

In future articles we will discuss in detail the exact methods of striking the
vulnerable areas. Look for our next file on Head and Neck Killing Techniques.
