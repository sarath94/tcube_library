        So you want to try an interesting little bomb I thought of? Well
   this file will give you the info on how to create these grenades. But
   before I start let me just say that this is just an informational file
   and what you do with it or if you get in trouble with it is not my fault
   (ie. You blow off your hand or the cops pay you a visit!) So please do
   not try any of the procedures mentioned in this file.

             
        Ok now one of the first things you are going to have to do is make
   a nice batch of Concentrated Nitric Acid! This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!
   Think how important this is to you before making it.


                 WHAT YOU WILL NEED FOR MAKING NITRIC ACID
                 =========================================

            Potassium Nitrate (saltpeter, get it at a drug store)

                    Sulfuric Acid (Acid in Car Battery)

                          distilled water

                     an adjustable Heat Source

                              retort

                             ice bath

                           stirring rod

                     A Collecting Flask with Stopper
                ===========================================

               NOTE: MAKING NITRIC ACID IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!
                     IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND IT IN PRINTING SHOPS
                     OR PHOTOGRAPHY STORES BECAUSE IT IS USED IN
                     CLEANING PRINTING PLATES! I STRESS LOOKING 
                     THERE BEFORE TRYING THIS!

                            -=%The Procedure%=-

        Ok. The first thing you are going to want to get your hands on is
   an UNCHARGED car battery because this contains the sulfuric acid.  
   Remove the top of the car battery but do it very gently! You don't want 
   this stuff splashing on you! Now pour out the sulfuric acid into the 
   retort. Next, carefully add about 68 grams of the Potassium Nitrate to the 
   retort very slowly! Once you have added it if all has not dissolved then 
   gently stir the solution in the retort with the glass stirring rod until it  
   is all dissolved. Now, place the open end of the retort into your 
   collecting flask and then place the collecting flask in the ice bath.  
   Now here comes the dangerous part in making the nitric acid. BE CAREFUL!
   Now begin heating the retort over the adjustable heat source using 
   low heat. Keep heating it until liquid starts coming out of the end of 
   the retort and continue heating until the precipitate in the bottom 
   of the retort is almost dry. The liquid is nitric acid. WARNING: IF THE
   ACID IS HEATED TOO STRONGLY THE NITRIC ACID WILL DECOMPOSE AS SOON AS IT
   IS FORMED! THIS CAN ALSO RESULT IN THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY TOXIC AND
   FLAMABLE GASSES THAT CAN EXPLODE VERY EASILLY! IF YOU SET THIS UP GET
   AWAY FROM IT WHEN YOU START HEATING IT. If you do this successfully you 
   will have Nitric Acid. However, I still stress looking to buy it somewhere 
   first. Also, read the rest of this file before attempting to make this 
   because you may find out that you don't have to make this! Also, remember
   that all you are making is some stupid mini-bomb which is hardly worth
   risking your life over!

==============================================================================

        Ok. Now I am going to tell you how to make NitroCellulose also known
   as Gun Cotton. YOU CAN BUY GUN COTTON AT SPORTING STORES OR AMMO STORES
   NORMALLY! IF YOU CAN PURCHASE IT THEN THERE IS NO REASON TO MAKE THE
   NITRIC ACID OR READ THIS PART EITHER! I ONCE AGAIN STRESS TRYING TO BUY
   IT BEFORE DOING ANY OF THIS BECAUSE MAKING NITRIC ACID IS VERY DANGEROUS!

                 
                 WHAT YOU WILL NEED FOR MAKING GUN COTTON
             =================================================

                        Cotton (obviously)

                           Nitric Acid

                       Sulfuric Acid (Read the part on getting
                                      this in the Nitric Acid
                                      section because it is 
                                      exactly the same!)

                         distilled water

                       two 200-300 ml beakers

                      funnel and filter paper

                          a pair of tongs
                         
                            Litmus Paper
            ===================================================

                             -=%Procedure%=-

        Pour 10 cc of the sulfuric acid into the beaker and then also add
   10 cc of Nitric Acid to the same beaker. Add .05 grams of cotton to it
   and allow it to soak for exactly 3 minutes. (note: the above is all 
   proportional so if you want double the amount of gun cotton then double
   the grams of cotton you add and double the cc's of the acids.) Remove
   the cotton with the tongs (YOU DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT WITH YOUR HANDS!)
   and place the cotton in the other beaker. Now wash the cotton in the 
   beaker with distilled water. Let the cotton dry and then wash it again.
   Test the cotton with the litmus paper. When you get a nuetral reading
   then you can remove the cotton from the beaker and allow it to dry. You
   now have Gun Cotton.

==============================================================================

        Now for the making of the grenade!


                WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE THE MINI GRENADE
                ===========================================

                        1 Glass Christmas Ornament

                              Gun Cotton

                           Long, suitable fuse
                ===========================================


        Ok. Here is the first thing you do. Get your Christmas Ornament and
   remove the little metal top where you would normally put the hook. Take
   your fuse and stick it in the ornament until it is touching the bottom of
   the ornament. Make sure your fuse is long enough because you don't want to
   light this thing and have it go off in your face! Now, take the Gun Cotton
   and gently push it into the ornament. The more you put it the louder the 
   explosion. Now take the metal cap from which you removed from the ornament
   and put the tip of the fuse through the center of it. Move the cap down
   the fuse and fasten it back onto the ornament. Now your fuse and cotton
   are less likely to come out. You now have a mini-grenade. Be careful when
   you use this because the glass will explode when the cotton ignites with
   enough force to deeply imbed itself in you. Now, if you are wondering how
   I did this I bought the Gun Cotton and didn't go through the process of 
   making the Nitric Acid and Gun Cotton simply because MY LIFE IS VERY
   IMPORTANT TO ME! You can do the same. You just have to look around 
   because this stuff is not to hard to find. The reason I chose Gun Cotton
   and not Gun Powder is because Gun Cotton is more explosive when it is
   closed in a space and is less likely to go off due to friction. Also, you 
   don't have to limit yourself to using Christmas Ornaments. It works in 
   just about anything! I have also made bombs by stuffing the Gun Cotton in 
   an old toilet paper roll carboard. ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING! When you are 
   stuffing the cotton in the ornament do it slowly and carefully because the 
   opening is not very big. I would try doing it by putting in one small piece 
   at a time. Well anyway that's it! Hope you enjoyed reading this.
