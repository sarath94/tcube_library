                          Improvised Explosives, Volume 1

================================================================================

    Ever since the new board went up, I've been asked by many people to put
up the stuff that was on the old one.

Here is some of the explosives information.

================================================================================

Black Powder:

75% Potassium Nitrate(Saltpeter)
15% Charcoal
10% Sulfur

Mix the above ingredents together. Add water until the mixture has a thick,
paste-like consistency. Let dry and pulverize resulting solid VERY
CAREFULLY. (The solid is Black Powder.) The grandaddy of explosives. Good for
fireworks, homebrew firearms (more on that later.), grenades, and just about
anything else. Be sure to pack it in tight.

Thermite:

8 Grams Hematite (Iron Rust)
3 Grams Aluminum Filings (at least 94% pure)
Magnesium ribbon

Mix together the Hematite and Aluminum. Insert the Magnesium ribbon into the
pile. (This is your fuse.) Light the fuse with a blowtorch (Radio Shack
single cylinder model). No explaination needed on how to use this stuff.

ANFO(or 'prills and oil')

94% Ammonium Nitrate (fertilizer - get at farming supplies store)
6% Fuel Oil

Mix the above ingredents together. Use a detonator to set off. ANFO is a
common commercial high explosive.

Nitrocellulose (gun cotton)

Cellulose (paper, cotton)
Nitric Acid
Sulfuric Acid

Mix the Nitric and Sulfuric acid, and treat the Cellulose with the mixture.
By varing the strength of the acids, temperature and time of reaction, and
acid/cellulose ratio, many different products can be made.

Nitrocellulose is used as a detonator, propellant, and in making flash paper,
a highly flammable stationary used for high security documents. Burns better
and quicker than the regular stuff.

Smoke Bomb:

1 part Sulphur
2 parts Zinc Powder

Mix the above chemicals, and set off. The nice thing about this one is that
it is simple, and made from easily availible materials.

Homemade Fuses:

Distilled water
Potassium Nitrate
Filter Paper (blotting paper)

Make a saturated solution of potassium nitrate, and water. Immerse the paper
strip into the solution, and wait a few seconds. Remove and let dry. You could
also use yarn instead of filter paper.
