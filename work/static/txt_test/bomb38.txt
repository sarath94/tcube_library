Following is a list of chemicals, most of which can be easily obtained. You will also find the chemical symbol of another chemical which explodes on contact with said chemical. This is useful in making the ever so useful pipe bomb.

This list should help you figure out the proper chemicals to help get your revenge. A simple application of this would be to take the chemical,
cap one end of a pipe, pour in the chemical, put the explosive
counterpart in a sealed glass test tube, put it inside the pipe,
cap the other end. Throw to detonate. (The glass breaks-- mixing the two chemicals)
