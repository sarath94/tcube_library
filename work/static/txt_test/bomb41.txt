RE: Discussion... 

The best way to start a trashcan fire is to mix equal portions (usually 1 cup) 
of HTH swimming pool chlorine and Pine-O-Pine household cleanser.

You should have about 10 seconds before it spontaneously combusts, but I give 
no guarantees just in case YOU should screw it up and blow your hand off.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!!!

Crystal draino and gas.  You will definitely get the desired results.  If you 
what a hot-burning fire, mix 2/3 oil with 1/3 gas. Whala (sp) Molitov cocktail.

To make a LOUD bomb, put a few drops of Potassium Permanganate and Gasoline in
a milk jug, close it, and move it around until the sides are coated.  Then 
throw it at something and BOOM. Instant explosion!

Take the Oxygen content out of alcohol, mix in metal arsenic (you need to keep 
this mixture quite cool when doing so), you can find it in the diodes of 
transistor radios, put in a small container (has to be glass).  This mixture 
burns like Napalm, however, the gas emmitted is a white gas (arsenic) and will 
kill everything within a 40 ft radius.  The only problem is getting the oxygen 
out of the alcohol, and I will never tell how to do that!

Isn't there an easier way to get oxygen?  Why does it have to be removed from 
alcohol?  Couldn't you get the oxygen by itself?  Do you mean the product left 
after you remove the oxygen? 

Please clarify a little more.  You can get both in their pure form without 
this hokey procedure.

Express yourself more clearly.

If I wasn't clear to you sorry.  However, I was referring to the byproduct 
after you remove the Oxygen content.  That is something you will not get in 
any store.  Once you remove the Oxygen content, it becomes quite volatile.

Come on, guys -- there's no reason to post how-to's here that people will try 
and get hurt.  Various types of bombs, indeed!

No just jokeing. These are for info. Purpose's only. (Unless they don't want   
it to be) But there is nothing bad about it. IF you are too immature than      
don't try these.
