*> Title:   General Plans for a pipe bomb
*> Date:    10/27/89
*> Time:    9:14 pm


Materials Needed:

(1) one pipe threaded at one end // sealed at the other // Large enough to
    slide (1) one small or regluar sized baby food jar (size is up to you just
    as long as the pipe can hold the jar)
(1) one caps to fit above mentioned threaded ends
(1) one Part Baking Soada
(1) one Part Vineger
--- Several Rocks [nice sharp ones ---
--- Several [Small] toothpicks
(2) two baby food jars // whatever size, as long as they fit inside the pipe

[*----------------------------------------------------*]

Take the vinegar and fill the baby food jar full, tightly screw the cap onto
the jar.
Take the pipe and slowly slide the baby food jar w/ the lid facing inside.
Take the toothpicks and lay center them on the jar.
Take the sharp rocks and carefully lay them against the toothpicks.
take the Next Baby food jar and fill it full, tightly screw the cap onto the
jar.
Take the Baby Food jar and slide it so that it rests against the rocks.  Be
very carefull, you do NOT want to break both jars.
Take the cap and screw it tightly onto the pipe.  Weld the cap shut.  If you
dont the pressure from inside will just pop the lid off, ergo, spoiling the
effect.
When ready to use, pop the pipe over your leg, or the wall or something, just
as long as you can tell that BOTH jars have been broken, now either throw said
pipe VERY far, or put said pipe into the subjects car, boat, locker, etc...and
quietly split...
