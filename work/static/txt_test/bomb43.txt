 BUILD AN ATOMIC BOMB BY THE WIZARD

YOU SAY YOU WANT DEATH? YOU SAY YOU WANT DESTRUCTION? WELL, HERE IS THE
*ULTIMATE* IN DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

THE FOLLOWING PLANS REQUIRE THE HANDLING OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS, AND I ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM DONE TO ANY PEOPLE OR CITIES AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THIS INFORMATION!

BEFORE WE GO INTO THE DETAILS OF BUILDING AN ATOMIC BOMB, LET'S EXPLORE THE HISTORY OF THE A-BOMB.

THE TIME: WORLD WAR II
THE PLACE: LOS ALAMOS

AMERICA'S TOP SCIENTISTS HAD BEEN WORKING FOR MONTHS ON A NEW KIND OF BOMB. ONE OF THESE NEW BOMBS COULD BLOW UP A WHOLE CITY! HITLER AND THE NAZI'S WERE ALSO WORKING ON THE A-BOMB, BUT WE GOT IT FIRST!

ONE MORNING, THE SKY OVER THE ALAMOGORDO DESERT WAS LIT UP BY A TERRIFIC EXPLOSION! THE NUCLEAR AGE WAS BORN!

THE TIME: SUMMER, 1945
THE PLACE: JAPAN

THE ALLIES WERE WINNING THE BATTLE FOR THE PACIFIC, BUT THE INVASION OF JAPAN
WOULD BE A LONG AND BLOODY AFFAIR!

PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN DECIDED TO DROP TWO ATOMIC BOMBS ON JAPAN, ONE ON HIROSHIMA, AND ONE ON NAGASAKI.

NEEDLESS TO SAY THE JAPANESE SURRENDERED SOON AFTERWARD.

NOW, ON WITH THE BOMB!

THE ATOMIC BOMB WE WILL BE CONSTRUCTING WILL HAVE A YIELD OF APPROXIMATELY 2
KILOTONS. THAT'S ENOUGH TO WIPE OUT A GOOD SECTION OF A CITY!

MATERIALS:

   - 20 KG WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM
   - TNT OR C4
   - WIRE
   - BLASTING CAPS (20-30)
   - A TIMING DEVICE OR RADIO CONTROLLED DETONATOR
   - AND SOME SORT OF CONTAINER TO HOLD ALL THE STUFF!

(CONFIGURATION MAY VARY)

CONSTRUCTION:

NOTE: SINCE YOU WILL BE WORKING WITH PLUTONIUM, I SUGGEST YOU WEAR ADEQUATE
PROTECTION FROM THE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL! ONE MICROSCOPIC BIT OF THAT PLUTONIUM WILL CAUSE A PAINFUL, AGONIZING DEATH!

STEP 1:

TAKE THE BALL OF PLUTONIUM AND PLACE IT ON A SUPPORT SO YOU CAN GET AT IT FROM
ALL SIDES. NEXT, TAKE GOLF-BALL SIZED CHUNKS OF THE TNT OR C4 AND PRESS THEM
ON TO THE BALL OF PLUTONUIM IN AN EVEN PATTERN ALL AROUND. PLACE A BLASTING CAP IN EACH CHARGE.

STEP 2:

RUN THE WIRES FROM THE CHARGES TO THE DETONATOR, MAKING SURE THAT THE CHARGES
STAY IN PLACE ON THE PLUTONIUM.

THE DETONATOR CAN BE MADE FROM AN ORDINARY CLOCK AND A CAR BATTERY. SET THE DETONATOR UP SO THAT WHEN THE CLOCK READS A CERTAIN TIME...KA-BOOOOOM!

IF YOU ARE USING A RADIO CONTROLLED DETONATOR, MAKE SURE YOU USE A QUIET RADIO FREQUENCY, OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BOMB GOING OFF IN YOUR LAP!

STEP 3:

TAKE THE BOMB TO WHERE YOU WANT TO SET IT OFF, AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!
YOU WANT TO BE AT LEAST 5 MILES AWAY WHEN IT GOES OFF!

HOW IT WORKS:
THE EXPLOSION OF THE TNT/C4 CHARGES CAUSES THE PLUTONIUM TO IMPLODE (SQUEEZE TOGETHER), AND THUS ACHIEVE CRITICAL MASS, AND EXPLODE WITH AN UNCONTROLLED CHAIN REACTION!
