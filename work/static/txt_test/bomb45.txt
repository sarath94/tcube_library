INGREDIENTS PAPER MATCHES, GLASS OR PLASTIC BOTTLE.

TAKE THE MATCHES AND A PAIR OF SCISSORS AND CUT THE TOP OF THE MATCHES OF WHERE
THE (BULK) OR SULFER ENDS. PACK THE HEADS IN THE BOTTLE AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE. YOU MAY USE UP TO A WHOLE BOX OF MATCHES TO MAKE ONE BOMB.

FOR THE WICK THATS ANOTHER STORY, ONCE THE BOTTLE IS FILLED TAKE PREFERABLLY
AN M80 TYPE WICK, AND INSERT IT IN SO IT WILL BE ABLE TO IGNITE THE SULFER
HEADS. ANOTHER WAY WOULD BE TO SOAK A PIECE OF CLOTH IN GAS OR, LIGHTER FLUID. WHEN LIGHTING I SUGGEST THAT YOU LIGHT IT QUICK THEN RUN LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL. THIS IS MY METHOD IF IT DOES NOT WORK I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR BODY PART LOSS.

PS. IF YOU USE GLASS FRAGMENTS MAY FLY SO TAKE COVER AND EXTREME CARE.
