     A COMMON MOUSETRAP CAN BE USED TO
MAKE A CIRCUIT CLOSING SWITCH FOR
ELECTRICALLY INITIATED EXPLOSIVES,
MINES AND BOOBY TRAPS.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:
-----------------

MOUSETRAP

HACKSAW OR FILE

CONNECTING WIRES


PROCEDURE:
----------

1) REMOVE THE TRIP LEVER FROM THE
MOUSETRAP USING A HACKSAW OR FILE.
ALSO REMOVE THE STAPLE AND HOLDING WIRE

2) RETRACT THE STRIKER OF THE MOUSETRAP
AND ATTACH THE TRIP LEVER ACROSS THE
END OF THE WOOD BASE USING THE STAPLE
WITH WHICH THE HOLDING WIRE WAS
ATTACHED.

NOTE:
----- IF THE TRIP LEVER IS NOT MADE OF
METAL, A PIECE OF METAL OF APPROXIMATE-
LY THE SAME SIZE SHOULD BE USED.

3) STRIP ONE IN. OF INSULATION FROM THE
ENDS OF 2 CONNECTING WIRES.

4) WRAP ONE WIRE TIGHTLY AROUND THE
SPRING LOADED STRIKER OF THE MOUSETRAP.

5) WRAP THE SECOND WIRE AROUND SOME
PART OF THE TRIP LEVER OR PIECE OF
METAL

NOTE:
----- IF A SOLDERING IRON IS AVAILABLE,
SOLDER BOTH OF THE ABOVE WIRES IN PLACE


HOW TO USE:
-----------

     THIS SWITCH CAN BE USED IN A
NUMBER OF WAYS--ONE TYPICAL METHOD IS
PRESENTED HERE.

     THE SEITCH IS PLACED INSIDE A BOX

BATTERIES.  THE SPRING LOADED STRIKER
IS HELD BACK BY THE LID OF THE BOX AND
WHEN THE BOX IS OPENED, THE CIRCUIT IS
