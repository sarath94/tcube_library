     BLACK POWDER CAN BE PREPARED IN A SIMPLE, SAFE MANNER. IT MAY BE USED AS BLASTING OR GUN POWDER.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:
-----------------

POTASSIUM NITRATE, GRANULATED, 3 CUPS
WOOD CHARCOAL, POWDERED, 2 CUPS
SULFUR, POWDERED, 1/2 CUP
ALCOHOL, 5 PINTS (WHISKEY, RUBBING ALCOHOL, ETC.)
WATER, 3 CUPS
HEAT SOURCE
2 BUCKETS -- EACH 2 GALLON CAPACITY, AT LEAST ONE OF WHICH IS HEAT
             RESISTANT (METAL, CERAMIC, ETC.)
FLAT WINDOW SCREENING, AT LEAST 1 FT. SQUARE
LARGE WOODEN STICK
CLOTH, AT LEAST 2 FT. SQUARE

NOTE: THE ABOVE AMOUNTS WILL YIELD 2 POUNDS OF BLACK POWDER. HOWEVER,
      ONLY THE RATIOS OF THE AMOUNTS OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE IMPORTANT.
      THUS, FOR TWICE AS MUCH BLACK POWDER, DOUBLE ALL QUANTITIES
      USED.

PROCEDURE:
---------

1) PLACE ALCOHOL IN ONE OF THE BUCKETS

2) PLACE POTASSIUM NITRATE, CHARCOAL, AND SULFUR IN THE HEAT RESISTANT
   BUCKET.  ADD 1 CUP WATER AND MIX THOROUGHLY WITH WOODEN STICK UNTIL
   ALL INGREDIENTS ARE DISSOLVED.

3) ADD REMAINING WATER (2 CUPS) TO MIXTURE.  PLACE BUCKET ON HEAT
   SOURCE AND STIR UNTIL SMALL BUBBLES BEGIN TO FORM.

CAUTION:  DO NOT BOIL MIXTURE.  BE SURE ALL MIXTURE STAYS WET.  IF ANY
          IS DRY, AS ON SIDES OF PAN, IT MAY IGNITE.

4) REMOVE BUCKET FROM HEAT AND POUR MIXTURE INTO ALCOHOL WHILE
   STIRRING VIGOROUSLY

5) LET ALCOHOL STAND ABOUT 5 MINUTES. STRAIN MIXTURE THROUGH CLOTH TO
   OBTAIN BLACK POWDER.  DISCARD LIQUID. WRAP CLOTH AROUND BLACK
   POWDER AND SQUEEZE TO REMOVE ALL EXCESS LIQUID.

6) PLACE SCREENING OVER DRY BUCKET. PLACE WORKABLE AMOUNT OF DAMP
   POWDER ON SCREEN AND GRANULATE BY RUBBING SOLID THROUGH SCREEN

NOTE: IF GRANULATED PARTICLES APPEAR TO STICK TOGETHER AND CHANGE
      SHAPE, RECOMBINE ENTIRE BATCH OF POWDER AND REPEAT STEPS 5 & 6.

7) SPREAD GRANULATED POWDER ON FLAT DRY SURFACE SO THAT LAYER ABOUT
   1/2 INCH IS FORMED.  ALLOW TO DRY.  USE RADIATOR , OR DIRECT
   SUNLIGHT.  THIS SHOULD BE DRIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY IN
   ONE HOUR.  THE LONGER THE DRYING PERIOD, THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE
   BLACK POWDER.

CAUTION: REMOVE FROM HEAT AS SOON AS GRANULES ARE DRY.  BLACK POWDER
         IS NOW READY FOR USE.
