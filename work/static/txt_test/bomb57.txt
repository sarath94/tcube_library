PROCEDURE:
---------
1) SULPHURIC ACID MUST BE CONCENTRATED. IF BATTERY ACID OR OTHER DILUTE ACID IS
USED, CONCENTRATE IT BY BOILING UNTIL DENSE WHITE FUMES ARE GIVEN OFF. CONTAINER USED SHOULD BE OF ENAMELWARE OR OVEN GLASS.

CAUTION: SULPHURIC ACID WILL BURN SKIN AND DESTROY CLOTHING. IF ANY IS SPILLED, WASH IT AWAY WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER. FUMES ARE ALSO DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NOT BE INHALED.

2) REMOVE THE ACID FROM HEAT AND ALLOW TO COOL TO ROOM TEMPERATURE.

3) POUR GASOLINE INTO THE LARGE (1 QUART) BOTTLE UNTIL IT IS APPROXIMATELY 2/3
   FULL

4) ADD CONCENTRATED SULPHURIC ACID TO GASOLINE SLOWLY UNTIL THE BOTTLE IS
   FILLED TO WITHIN 1" TO 2" FROM TOP. PLACE THE STOPPER ON THE BOTTLE.

5) WASH THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTLE THOROUGHLY WITH CLEAR WATER.

CAUTION: IF THIS IS *NOT* DONE, THE FIRE BOTTLE MAY BE DANGEROUS TO HANDLE
DURING USE.

6) WRAP A CLEAN CLOTH OR SEVERAL SHEETS OF ABSORBENT PAPER AROUND THE OUTSIDE
   OF THE BOTTLE. TIE WITH STRING OR FASTEN WITH RUBBER BANDS.

7) DISSOLVE 1/2 CUP OF POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND 1/2 CUP OF SUGAR IN ONE CUP OF
   BOILING WATER.

8) ALLOW THE SOLUTION TO COOL, POUR INTO THE SMALL BOTTLE AND CAP TIGHLY. THE
   COOLED SOLUTION SHOULD BE APPROX. 2/3 CRYSTALS AND 1/3 LIQUID. IF THERE IS
   MORE LIQUID THAN THIS, POUR OFF EXCESS BEFORE USING.

CAUTION: STORE THIS BOTTLE SEPARATELY FROM THE OTHER BOTTLE

HOW TO USE:
----------
1) SHAKE THE SMALL BOTTLE TO MIX CONTENTS AND POUR ONTO THE CLOTH OR PAPER
   AROUND THE LARGE BOTTLE.

BOTTLE CAN BE USED WET OR AFTER SOLUTION HAS DRIED. HOWEVER, WHEN DRY, THE SUGAR - POTASSIUM CHLORATE MIXTURE IS VERY SENSITIVE TO SPARK OR FLAME AND
SHOULD BE HANDLED ACCORDINGLY.

2) THROW OR LAUNCH THE BOTTLE. WHEN THE BOTTLE BREAKS AGAINST A HARD SURFACE
   (TARGET) THE FUEL WILL IGNITE.
