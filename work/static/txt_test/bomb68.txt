How To Make Tear Gas In Your Basement
-------------------------------------

  The method of making tear gas is so simple that anyone can do it. The two
things to remember are care and caution. You will need a certain amount of
equipment but, you can find them in any hobbie shop, or home chemical supplier.
If you don't already own a gask mask, go out and get one. They are sold at any
Army-Nazy stores for under 10 bux.

Materials Needed
----------------

1.  Ring Stand            14. Rubber Tubing
2.  Alcohol Lamp          15. Glass Tubing
3.  Flask (300-ml)        16. Rubber Stopper
4.  Clamp                 17. Collecting Bottle
5.  Rubber Stopper        18. Glass Tubing
6.  Glass Tubing          19. Rubber Tubing
7.  Clamp Holder          20. Glass Tubing
8.  Rubber Tubing         21. Rubber Tubing
9.  Condenser             22. Air Trap Bottle
10. Rubber Tubing         23. Glass Tubing
11. Ring Stand            24. Rubber Tubing
12. Clamp and Clamp       25. Glass Tubing
    Holder                26. Beaker (300-ml)
13. Rubber Tubing


Method For Preparing Tear Gas:
------------------------------

1. Work in a garage, or outside if possible - not in the kitchen.

2. Mix ten parts of glycerine with two parts of sodium bisulfate, in
   flask (No. 3), and heat. Do not fill more than one-third of flask,
   as mixture froths when heated. When the frothing begins, adjust heat.

3. As soon as you see no more tear gas being generated, and solids
   begginging to be formed in the generating flask (No. 3), or a brown
   residue in the tube (No. 6), remove the heat source, 'With your gas
   mask on', and pour out the residue in flask. You must pour this outside.
   'Do not pour down sink or toilet.'

4. Remove collecting jar (No. 17) and stopper it QUICKLY. What you have
   collected here is tear gas.

5. Do not attempt to make more than three ounces at one time.

6. Make sure all joints are tight.


Method to step up equipment
---------------------------

1. Metal base ring stands (No. 1 & 11) are placed on working surface.

2. Clamp and clamp holder (No. 4 & 7) are placed onto ring stand (No. 1).

3. Clamp and clamp holder (No. 12) are placed on ring stand (No. 11).

4. Generating Flask (No. 3) is placed in clamp (No. 4).

5. Two pieces of rubber tubing (No. 10 & 13) are connected to condenser
   (No. 9).

6. Condenser (No. 9) is placed into clamp (No. 12).

7. Segment of glass tubing (No. 6) is placed in rubber stopper (No. 5).

8. Segments of glass tubing (No. 15 & 18) are put into rubber storrer
   (No. 16).

9. Segments of glass tubing (No. 20 & 23) are put into rubber stopper
   (No. 21).

10. Rubber stopper (No. 5) is put into the mouth of the generating flask
    (No. 3).

11. Rubber stopper (No. 16) is put into mouth of collecting bottle (No. 17).

12. Rubber stopper (No. 21) is put into mouth of air trap bottle (No. 22).

13. Connect glass tubgin (No. 6) with condenser (No. 9) and with rubber
    tubing (No. 8).

14. Connect condenser (No. 9) with glass tubing (No. 5) and with rubber
    tubing (No. 14).

15. Connect glass tubing (No. 18) with glass tubing (No. 20) and rubber
    tubing (No. 19).

16. Connect glass tubing (No. 23) with glass tubing (No. 24) and with rubber
    tubing (No. 24)

17. Connect rubber tubing (No. 10) to a faucet.

18. Put end of rubber tubing (No. 10) into a sink or drain.

19. Fill beaker (No. 26) three-quarters full of water, and place glass
    tubing (No. 25) in the water.

20. Turn on water to rubber tubing. (No. 13).

21. Light wick on alcohol heater (No. 2) and place under generating flask
    (No. 3).

      The best method for putting tear gas into operation is to place it under pressure in a glass vial or bottle. Then throw the bottle at the target you have in mind. The glass will break on contact (NOOO SHIT) and allow the tear gas to escape. Other successful methods have been proven, including compressing in an atomizer, aerosol can, or seltzer bottles.

      Well, hope you enjoyed this phile. It won't be the last from the 916 Cartel.
