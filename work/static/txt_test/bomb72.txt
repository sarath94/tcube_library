-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, you want to learn about some explosives, eh sonny? Well, you have come to the right place. Starting with this file, a series begins that will try to bring that world of demolitions and fun ( ha ha ) a little closer to you. This serier, ingeniously dubbed the "Explosive Files" will go through the many types of explosives around. In addition, a few sidetracks will be made on the way in the areas of fireworks or whatever seems appropriate. As you delve through what is contained in the files, you may find some helpful information, you may not. But have fun reading them anyway.

If you haven't figured this one out yet, this file is formatted for 80 columns. And the rest of the files are the same way. So, using a quote I saw once on a file on a board, " Use your damn printers people !!! "

   And now on with the show.



                           EXPLOSIVES
                ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


   To start learning about explosives, you have got to start at the begining. I plan to be as thorough as possible, but I may forget things every now and then. The files should still be complete though. So now to start at the beginning......

   An explosive is a substance that, under the influence of heat, shock, or some other agency, undergoes a chemical reaction that causes it to decompose or break up quickly with more or less violence ( whew ). Explosives fly to pieces because the materials composing them react in such a way that solids or liquids are suddenly converted into gases, which tend to expand and rapidly fill a larger volume of space. Heat is also developed and acts as a catalyst (something that changes the speed of the reaction in some way. In this case it speeds it up. ). The noise associated with an explosion is caused by air waves. An explosion is an intensified combustion also.
   The history of explosives is too long for one file, but certain events are covered in individual files. For instance, gunpowder's history is in the gunpowder file. 
   Lets narrow the scope a little here and get a little introduction into explosives. How they are classified is a good thing to know, so here it is.
   There are basically 3 different types of explosives existing. All explosives fall into one of these categories somewhere. What follows is a listing of each of these categories with a brief description and some examples.


I. Propellants

   Propellants, or low explosives, are combustible materials, containing within themselves all oxygen needed for their combustion. They burn themselves out but do not explode, and function by producing gas which explodes.

Examples are Black powder and smokeless powder.


II. Primary Explosives

   Primary Explosives, or initiators as they are sometimes called, explode or detonate when they are heated or subjected to shock. They do not burn and sometimes they do not even contain the elements necessary for combustion. The materials themselves explode, and the explosion results whether they are confined or not. Their brisance, or the shock which they produce when they explode, differs considerably in different explosives, as does their sensitivity to heat and the amount of heat they give off.

Examples : Mercury Fulminate, Lead Azide, Fulminating Gold, the mixture of Red Phosphorus with Potassium Chlorate, Copper Acetylide, Nitrogen Sulfide, and Tetracene.


III. High Explosives

   High Explosives detonate under the influence of the shock of the explosion of a suitable primary explosive. They do not function by burning. Most of them can be ignited by a flame though and in a small amount generally burn tranquilly and can be extinguished easily. If heated to a high temperature by
external heat or by their own combustion, they will sometimes explode. They are generally more brisant and powerful than primary explosives. They exert a mechanical effect on whatever is near them when they explode, whether they are confined or not.

Examples : Dynamite, Trinitrotoluene, Tetryl, Picric Acid, Nitrocellulose, Nitroglycerin, Liqiud Oxygen mixed with wood pulp, fuming Nitric Acid mixed with Nitrobenzene, Ammonium Nitrate , Ammonium Perchlorate, and Nitroguanidine.


   So Now you have taken the first step toward your explosive education. The next file will be on igniters and will be important for detonating stuff. See ya then.
