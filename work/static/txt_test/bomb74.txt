     Here we are with a list of primary high explosives. It's not much, but there are not many of them. There are many more secondary high and low explosives ( see the next two files ).

Mercury Fulminate
:::::::::::::::::

     Mercury Fulminate is an initiating explosive, commonly appearing as white or gray crystals. It is extremely sensetive to initiation by heat, friction, spark or flame, and impact. It will detonate when initiated by any of the ways. When stored continiously at temperatures above 100 degrees F it gradually becomes inert. A dark-colored product of deterioration gives evidence of this condition. Mercury Fulminate is commonly stored underwater except in places where freezing is possible. Then it is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.


Lead Styphnate
:::: :::::::::

     Lead Styphnate is an initiating explosive, usually appearing in orange or white crystals. It is easily ignited by heat and static discharge, but cannot be used to start secondary high explosive reliably. Lead Styphnate is an ingredient in priming mixtures for small arms ammunition. Lead Styphnate is stored underwater except where freezing is possible. Then it stored under water and alcohol. 


Lead Azide
:::: :::::

     Lead Azide is an initiating explosive produced as a white to buff crystalline substance. It is more reliable than Mercury Fulminate and it does not decompose during long storage at moderately elevated temperatures ( 90 and above ). It should not be loaded into copper or brass containers because Copper Azide, an extremely sensitive explosive, can be formed in the presence of moisture.


DDNP
Diazodinitrophenol
::::::::::::::::::

     DDNP is a primary high explosive. It is used extensively in commercial blasting caps that are initiated by black powder safety fuse. It is superior to Mercury Fulminate in stability but is not as stable as Lead Azide. DDNP is desenzitized by immersion in water.
