Homemade M-80's



 It's getting tougher and harder for citizens to buy fireworks... so here is a way to make your own M-80s...

  To make the M-80s, you need precut casing stock three-fourths of an inch
inside diameter by half an inch inside diameter, the green style of M-80
safety fuse, potassium perchlorate, German black aluminum powder, halfinch end plugs, and glue.
  First, cut the casing stock into casings one and a half inches long. Plug one end with a half-inch end plug and glue. Allow to dry. Punch a one-eighth inch hole in the center of the side of the casing and insert a three-inch piece of safety fuse. Secure with a drop of glue and allow to dry. Repeat for as many casings as you want.
  Now it's time to mix the powder. In a coffee can, mix seven parts of potassium perchlorate and three parts of the German black aluminum powder. But, please wear some type of face mask and heavy gloves while doing this for your own safety.
  When you've mixed the two chemicals thoroughly, the powder is done. Keep it in the coffee can, covered, until needed. These parts are measured by grams, so a decent gram scale should be used.
  Fill each casing about three quarters full with the powder and glue in the other end plug. Allow to dry. The finished M-80s can now be painted and waterproofed. To waterproof, simply rub some paraffin wax on the casing and the ends. This isn't really necessary but is a good idea.

These M-80s are really very powerful so caution is advised.
