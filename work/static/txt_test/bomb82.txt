THE Mad Phone-man's Recipe for Napalm
---------------------------------------

Needed materials:

        Gasoline-Regular
        Styrofoam- Pellets,packing material, drinking cups,peanuts, as long
                   it dissolves under a drop of gasoline.
        Glass bottles- Realemmon Juice type, Absolute Vodka, or other thin
                       glass wall bottles.
        Rags- Cotton, cut into 2" by 12" strips
        Funnel- To fit bottles.
        Bucket- Type that will not disolve in gasoline.

Procedure:
        Pour enough gasoline into the bucket to fill all bottles. Start adding
        the styrofoam to the gasoline, stirring until it dissolves into a
        liquid approximately the consistancy of honey or syrup. Caution, do not
        over dissolve styro as it has a tendency to expand and become
        too thick. (A little experimentation here works out well)

        Pour the mixture into the dry bottles, (water in them will be dangerous
        to user) leave enough room at the top to plug the hole tightly with
        a strip of rag folded in half. Do not saturate rag at this time with
        gas or napalm. The rag should extend into the void at the top of the
        bottle about 2".

Deployment:
        Transport to site of usage carefully, and upright. DONT SMOKE! Turn
        bottle upside down briefly to saturate wick, or wick can be doused with
        lighter fluid or charcoal lighter. (I don't use pure gasoline here
        cause of premature ignition of device). Light wick, and deploy
        immediately, smashing against the object to be napalmed. Aim high, the
        mixture runs down.

Cautions:
        Too much air space in top of bottle risks explosion of fumes trapped
        there. Any water in mixture causes either the flame to sputter and
        and extinguish, or splatter user with flaming fuel.
