PIPE BOMBS by The Mortician
 
Ok well what you will do is get some gun powder (see message on how to make it)
but if you can buy it you are better off. You can get it at most gun shops if you are over 18. Now what you do is go down to a hardware store and buy lead piping about 4-6 inches long and 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Get two caps for each pipe. Now drill a hole in the center of the pipe through one side. Put one cap on and fill the pipe up with powder. Put the other cap on. Stick a long fuse in the hole and use model glue or something to keep it in. Then light it and get away fast!!!!! The caps will usually fly off so if you have a target aim one of the caps at it and leave the other one 1/2 turn from fully tight. But still stand way out of range as this is very dangerous.
