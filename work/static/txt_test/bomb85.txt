THE ULTIMATE PIPE BOMB BY MS REALITY


THIS FILE WILL INSTRUCT YOU ON HOW TO MAKE A MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON FROM VERY
LITTLE PARTS, TIME, AND EXPENSE TO YOU.

ITEMS NEEDED:

1: 1 CAN 1F,2F,3F,OR 4F GUNPOWDER
2: PVC OR GALVANIZED STEEL PIPE 6-7 INCHES LONG. ABOUT 4-5 OF THESE.
3: 100 FEET THICK FUSE
4: 1 CARTON BB'S
5: PIPE CAPS..FOR THE STEEL OR PVC.
6: LIGHTER AND CANDLE.
7: DRILL WITH BIT AS THICK AS FUSE
8: FUNNEL


GUNPOWDER IS AVAILABLE AT MOST FIREARM STORES FOR ABOUT 10-15$ DEPENDING ON 
THE FLASH CONSISTENCY OF IT. 1F POWDER IS THE CHEAPEST, AND BURNS VERY SLOWLY. A POOR CHOICE. 2F POWDER.'PYRODEX' IS NEXT UP...OK, BUT NOT A CHOICE I WOULD MAKE. BURNS A LITTLE FASTER. 3F POWDER: GOOD CHOICE. FINE GRANULES, HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE. BURNS QUICKLY. 4F POWDER: THE BEST. SUPER FINE GRAINS, BURNS INSTANTLY. MY CHOICE.

*NOTE*: THE ONLY THING 4F POWDER IS EVER USED FOR IS TO PRIME THE PAN ON A VERY
OLD FLINTLOCK MUSKET. WILL NOT BE SOLD UNLESS YOU FEED HIM SOMETHING LIKE THIS: 'MY UNCLE JUST GAVE THIS TO ME, & I WANT TO PICK UP SOME PRIMER POWDER FOR IT..THANKS', OR FIND SOMEONE 18 TO BUY IT FOR YOU..

PIPE: USE PVC PIPE AND CAPS WHEN YOU HAVE 1F,2F, OR 3F POWDER. IF YOU USE GAL. STEEL, IT WILL BE TOO MUFFLED TO WORK PROPERLY. GAL. STEEL IS FOR USE WITH 4F POWDER ONLY. GET THE SCREW ON TYPE CAPS.

FUSE: GET FAST BURNING FUSE..SAY IT IS  FOR YOUR TOY CANNON OR SOMETHING. GET
A LOT, CUZ YOU USE IT UP FAST. MAKE SURE TO USE ABOUT 3-3 1/2 FEET OF  FUSE FOR EACH BOMB..YOU AREN'T IN A  BIG RUSH, AND I KINDA LIKE TO KEEP MY ASS IN ONE PIECE.

BB'S: GET COPPERHEAD TYPE OR WHATEVER. THESE ARE FOR THE SHRAPNEL EFFECT. KINDA NEAT WHEN USED AROUND GREEN HOUSES PIPE CAPS: USE PLASTIC FOR PVC, SCREW-ON STEEL FOR GAL. STEEL PIPES. NOT TOO STRONG THOUGH, TRY AND GET THE THINNER TYPES.

LIGHTER AND CANDLE: FOR MELTING WAX ONTOFUSE AND PIPE CASING. THIS SECURES THE
FUSE.

DRILL: FOR DRILLING HOLE INTO PIPE. MAKE SURE THE HOLE IS NOT BIGGER THAN THE FUSE, OR YOU GET AN ILL FIT. BAD!

FUNNEL: FOR MEASURING BB'S AND POWDER INTO PIPE. VERY USEFUL.


HOW TO PUT IT TOGETHER STEP BY STEP
-----------------------------------
STEP:1

TAKE THE PIPE. DRILL A HOLE IN THE CENTER OF IT. BE CAREFUL! TAKE FUSE AND
INSERT ALL THE WAY INTO THE HOLE. TAKE THE LIGHTERAND MELT WAX ONTO THE FUSE AND HOLE. MAKE SURE IT IS DRY BEFORE YOU CONTINUE.

STEP:2

SCREW ON PIPE CAP TO ONE END OF PIPE, MAKE SURE IT FITS TIGHTLY. NOW MEASURE IN A RATIO OF ABOUT 5 PARTS POWDER TO ONE PART BB'S. (4F) OR EXPERIMENT, AND FIND THE RATIO YOU LIKE. BE CAREFUL, TOO MUCH BB'S MUFFLES THE EXPLOSION, AND TOO MUCH POWDER JUST MAKES A BIG NOIZE WITH NOT MUCH PUNCH. POUR IT IN THE FUNNEL, INTO THE PIPE. PACK IT DOWN, AND PUT MORE IN. THE GREATER THE COMPRESSION, THE BIGGER BANG.

STEP:3

PUT THE OTHER CAP ONTO THE PIPE. SECURE IT WELL. LOOK AT THE FUSE TO SEE IF 
YOU MESSED UP THE SEAL AT ALL. IF YOU DID, DO NOT MELT WAX ONTO IT TO TRY AND SEAL IT! THIS COULD BE BAD NEWS! START OVER, AND BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME!

NOW YOU ARE DONE! VOILA, A PIPE BOMB IN 3 EASY STEPS. EXPERIMENT AROUND WITH IT, AND FIND THE BEST COMBINATIONS OF MIXTURE...
