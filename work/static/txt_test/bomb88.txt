 KITCHEN IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES
          BY TIM LEWIS PART I
   HOW TO MAKE PLASTIQUE FROM BLEACH
 
THIS EXPLOSIVE IS A POTASSIUM CHLORATE EXPLOSIVE. THIS EXPLOSIVE AND EXPLOSIVES OF SIMILAR COMPOSITION WERE USED IN WWI AS THE MAIN EXPLOSIVE FILLER IN GRENADES, LAND MINES, AND MORTER ROUNDS USED BY FRENCH, GERMAN, AND SOME OTHER FORCES INVOLVED IN THAT CONFLICT.

THESE EXPLOSIVES ARE RELATIVELY SAFE TO MANUFCTURE. BY RELATIVELY SAFE, I MEAN
JUST THAT! DON'T SCREW AROUND WITH THIS SHIT, EITHER MAKE IT OR DON'T! I HATE TO HEAR OF A PHREAK BUYING IT BECAUSE HE WAS FUCKING WITH SOME CHEMICALS AND THE BLEW UP IN HIS FACE. THE PROCEDURES IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAN BE DANGEROUS, IF YOU DON'T TAKE SPECIAL CARE, AND WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

ON SHOULD STRIVE TO MAKE SURE THESE EXPLOSIVES ARE FREE FROM SULFURE, SULFIDES, AND PICRIC ACID. THE PRESENCE OF THESE COMPOUNDS RESULT IN MIXTURES THAT ARE OR CAN BECOME HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND POSSIBLY DECOMPOSE EXPLOSIVELY WHILE IN STORAGE. ONE SHOULD NEVER STORE HOME MADE EXPLOSIVES, MAKE ENOUGH FOR WHAT YOU NEED AT THE TIME. YOU NEVER KNOW HOW STABLE IT IS UNTIL IT BLOWS!

THE MANUFACTER OF THIS EXPLOSIVE FROM BLEACH IS GIVEN JUST AS AN EXPEDIANT
METHOD. THIS METHOD OF MANUFACTURING POTASSIUM CHLORATE IS NOT ECONOMICAL DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY USED TO BOIL THE SOLUTION AND CAUSE THE "DISSOCIATION" REACTION TO TAKE PLACE. THE PROCEDURE DOES WORK AND YIELDS A RELATIVELY PURE AND A SULFUR, SULFIDE FREE PRODUCT.

THESE EXPLOSIVES ARE VERY CAP SENSITIVE AND REQUIRE ONLY A #3 CAP FOR INSTIGATING DETONATION.

TO MANUFACTURE POTASSIUM CHLORATE FROM BLEACH, (5.25% SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE
SOLUTION), OBTAIN A HEAT SOURCE, HOT-PLATE, STOVE, ETC. A BATTERY HYDROMETER, A LARGE PYREX OR ENAMELED STEEL CONTAINER, (TO WEIGH CHEMICALS), AND SOME POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, (SOLD AS SALT SUBSTITUTE).

TAKE ONE GALLON OF BLEACH AND PLACE IT IN THE CONTAINER AND BEGIN HEATING IT.
WHILE THIS SOLUTION HEATS, WEIGH OUT 63 GRAMS POTASSIUM CHLORIDE AND ADD THIS
TO THE BLEACH BEING HEATED. BRING THIS SOLUTION TO A BOIL AND BOIL UNTIL WHEN
CHECKED WITH A HYDROMETER THE READING IS 1.3, (IF BATTERY HYDROMETER IS USED, IT SHOULD READ FULL CHARGE.)

WHEN THE READING IS 1.3 TAKE THE SOLUTION AND LET IT COOL IN THE REFRIGERATOR UNTIL IT IS BETWEEN ROOM TEMPERATURE AND 0 DEGREES CELCIUS. FILTER OUT THE CRYSTALS THAT HAVE FORMED AND SAVE THEM. BOIL THIS SOLUTION AGAIN AND COOL AS BEFORE. FILTER AND SAVE THE CRYSTALS.

TAKE THESE CRYSTALS THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED AND MIX THEM WITH DISTILLED WATER IN THE FOLLOWING PROPORTIONS: 56 GRAMS PER 100 MILILETERS DISTILLED WATER. HEAT THIS SOLUTION UNTIL IT BOILS AND ALLOW TO COOL.  FILTER THE SOLUTION AND SAVE THE CRYSTALS THE FORM UPON COOLING. THIS PROCESS OF PURIFICATION IS CALLED FRACTIONAL CRYSTALIZATION. THESE CRYSTALS SHOULD BE RELATIVELY PURE POTASSIUM CHLORATE.

POWER THESE TO THE CONSISTANCY OF FACE POWDER AND HEAT GENTLY TO DRIVE OFF ALL MOISTURE.

MELT FIVE PARTS VASELINE AND FIVE PARTS WAX. DISSLOVE THIS IN WHITE GASOLINE,
(CAMP STOVE GASOLINE), AND POUR THIS LIQUID ON 90 PARTS POTASSIUM CHLORATE,
(THE POWDERED CRYSTALS FROM ABOVE), IN A PLASTIC BOWL.

KNEAD THIS LIQUID INTO THE POTASSIUM CHLORATE UNTIL INTIMATELY MIXED. ALLOW ALL THE GASOLINE TO EVAPORATE.

PLACE THIS EXPLOSIVE IN A COOL DRY PLACE. AVOID FRICTION, SULFUR, SULFIDES, AND PHOPHOROUS COMPOUNDS. THIS EXPLOSIVE IS BEST MOLDED TO THE DESIRED SHAPE AND DENSITY OF 1.3 GRAMS IN A CUBE AND DIPPED IN WAX TILL WATER PROOF. THESE BLOCK TYPE CHARGES GUARANTEE THE HIGHEST DETONATION VELOCITY.
