    Vegetable Shortening Bomb
    -------------------------

         Materials:
              Chlorine Bleach or pool chlorine
              Vegetable Shortening

         Procedure:
              Mix the two together and watch the smoke pour out. Don't
              inhale the fumes they are dangerous to your health


    Pipe Bomb
    ---------

         Materials:
              Pipe with threads on one end
              Cap for pipe.
              Paraffin
              Steel disk size of pipe
              Hydrochloric acid

         Procedures:
              Take the pipe crimp one end closed and fill about 3/4 full of
              paraffin, poke a number of holes in the paraffin. On top of
              this place the steel disk (**make sure it fits around the top
              of the pipe completely) Put some HCl on the disk put cap on
              set with paraffin end down and get the hell away from there.
              In 2-5 minutes depending on the thickness of the disk... it
              goes kaboom cause the pressure builds of from the chemical
              reaction of the paraffin and the acid... the cap or the pipe
              (whichever is stronger) bursts

    Light Bulb Bomb
    ---------------

         Materials:
              Light Bulb
              Drill and Small Bit
              Gasoline
              Some silicon or something to plug a hole in the bulb.

         Procedures:
              Drill a small hole in the bulb fill it 1/2 way with gasoline
              plug the hole with the silicon (or something like that) screw
              it in (with the power off of course) and when the person
              turns it on boom!!!!

    Small Explosive mixtures:
    -------------------------

         Materials:
              Petroleum jelly
              Potassium nitrate

         Procedure:
              Mix the petroleum jelly and potassium nitrate in a one to one
              ratio.  When wet it is harmless... but when it dries it is
              highly explosive and shock sensitive. ****store in oil

         Materials:
              Potassium iodide
              pure iodine
              Ammonium hydroxide [ammonia water 10%]

         Procedures:
              Mix 3 grams of potassium iodide and 5 grams of iodine in a
              beaker with 50 ml. of water.  Then add 20 ml. of Ammonium
              Hydroxide filter this substance and the resulting solid is
              called nitrogen triiodine. When this is wet it is safe but
              when it is dry it is as unstable as the last mixture.

    Common Rocket Fuel
    ------------------

         Materials:
              Potassium nitrate
              Powdered sugar

         Procedures:
              Mix the two together in a 1 to 1 ratio.  Then take an old
              sauce pan and melt it. It should turn into a fudgey looking
              compound Pour this into a cardboard tube and put a fuse in.
              Let hardened. It is easier just taking two dry ingredients
              and packing them in a tube or just lighting as a powder.  As
              a powder it makes lots of smoke.

    Chlorite Mixtures
    -----------------
         NOTE: The main ingredient for this experiment is potassium or
         sodium chlorite. Both of these are equally as good.  However, both
         may prove difficult to find.  Probably the only way to get it
         would be to order it through a chemical warehouse.

         Materials:
              Potassium or Sodium Chlorite
              Powdered Charcoal
              Powdered aluminum
              Sulfur

         Procedures:
              Mix sulfur, charcoal, and aluminum in mortar. Grind well to
              make sure the mixture is evenly mixed.  Add the Chlorite
              (**Do not grind after the chlorite is added) You can use this
              for many uses smoke bombs, model rocket fuel, etc.

    Green Goddess
    -------------

         Materials:
              Zinc
              Sulfur

         Procedure:
              Mix the zinc and sulfur in a one to one ratio. To ignite use
              Magnesium and a blow torch.  Matches won't work. (A good
              source of magnesium is sparklers.)

    Nitrate Compound
    ----------------

         Materials:
              Potassium Nitrate
              Aluminum Powder
              Sulfur

         Procedure:
              Mix 2 Tbsps of the Potassium Nitrate, 2 tbsps of Aluminum
              Powder and 1 1/2 tbsps of Sulfur. Put in a container put a
              fuse in it light and throw makes tons of smoke.

                   Here are a few tips:
                       a.)To make more smoke add more sulfur
                       b.)To make it burn slower, add more Potassium Nitrate
                       c.)To make it burn faster add more Aluminium

    Missile Launcher
    ----------------

         Materials:
              empty can (gasoline can preferably)
              gasoline
              paper bag
              aluminium foil

         Procedures:
              Cut a piece out of the bag the size of your can.  Roll it up
              cigar-style and tape the very ends to keep it in the same shape
              Now, take your missile, and stick about 3/4ths of it in a
              pool of gasoline, and let it soak a little while.  Now, on
              the upper limit where the Gas hit rip a small piece almost
              completely, bend it and twist it... that's your fuse.  Now
              put aluminum foil on the top. the amount of foil that you put
              on determines the range of the missile.  The more the shorter
              ... makes it easier to aim.  Put the missile in the hole in
              the Gas can so that the fuse is lightable and light it, and
              stand back (it makes a bit of a noise.

    Car Bomb
    --------

         Materials:
              Tylenol bottle (empty)
              Liquid Drayno
              Heavy wire or solder.

         Instructions:
              Fill the bottle all the way full of liquid drayno. Close the
              bottle wrap some wire or solder around the neck of the bottle
              (to make it sink fast) Slip it in a car's Gas tank and run...
              In about 5-15 minutes *BOOM*

    Fragmentation Grenade
    ---------------------

         Materials:
              Can of Vasoline
              Rusty nails
              A fuse

         Instructions:

              Remove top from can of vasoline and punch a small hole in it
              just big enough for the fuse to fit through. Put the rusty
              nails in the vasoline and put the top back on tape the top
              securely and put the fuse in... light throw and run.
              ***BOOM*** Nails, glass, and burning vasoline all over.
