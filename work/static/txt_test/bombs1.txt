_______________ _______________ _______

NOW ON TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF MAKING
	   EXPLOSIVES
_______________ _______________ _______


I. EXPLOSIVES MADE WITH STUFF AROUND
  THE HOUSE

   A.NAPALM
     1. MATERIALS NEEDED
	a.JOY SOAP
	b.COKE CAN WITH SAWED-OFF
	  TOP
	c.AMMONIA PELLETS
	d.A DRILL
        f.A NAIL
	g.STRING
	h.GASOLINE

     WHAT TO DO:
  MIX THE JOY AND GASOLINE TOGETHER
122 AND 122. TAKE THE COKE CAN AND FILL
IT HALFWAY WITH THE MIXTURE.
DRILL A HOLE BIG ENOUGH FOR THE NAIL
TO FIT THROUGH IN THE AMMONIA PELLET.
PUT THE NAIL THROUGH THE PELLET AND
PLACE IT OVER THE TOP OF THE CAN.
ATTACH THE STRING TO THE NAIL, GET VERY
FAR AWAY AND PULL THE STRING.

	 BE CAREFUL!!!!!

   B.PIPE BOMB
     1.MATERIALS NEEDED
       a.1 FOOT STEEL PIPE, ENDS
	   THREADED, CAPS FOR THE
	   END.
       b.BABYFOOD JAR FILLED WITH
	   VINEGAR
       c.BAKING SODA (1 BOX)
       d.SMALL, SHARP ROCKS

  WHAT TO DO:
    CAP ONE END OF THE JAR AND POUR THE BAKING SODA DOWN INTO THE END OF IT.
PUT SOME SHARP ROCKS ON TOP OF THE BAKING SODA AND PLACE THE BABYFOOD JAR
ON TOP OF THE ROCKS. NOW CAP THE OTHER END, (YOU MIGHT WANT TO FILL THE REST
OF THE EMPTY SPACE INSIDE THE PIPE WITH SOME TOILET PAPER OR SOMETHING, SO THE
BOTTLE DOESN'T SLIDE AROUND ALOT.) WHEN YOU WANT TO USE IT, SMACK THE END WITH
THE BAKING SODA ON SOME HARD CONCRETE SO THAT THE BOTTLE BREAKS. THE VINEGAR
AND THE SODA WILL MIX AND BUILD PRESSURE UNTIL IT REALLY BLOWS. IT MIGHT TAKE
AWHILE, BUT IT WILL GO OFF, SO DONT HANG ON TO IT, GET THE FUCK RID OF IT! AND
IF YOU THINK, BUT ARE NOT SURE THAT YOU MAY HAVE BROKE THE JAR, PUT IT IN AN
OPEN PLACE (OR A CAR OR SOMETHING) AND SIT BACK (WAY BACK) AND WATCH THE
FIREWORKS!


  C.SMOKE BOMBS
    1.WHAT YA NEED
      a.SUGAR
      b.SALTPETER

   WHAT TA DO:
  MIX THE SUGAR AND SALTPETER TOGETHER ABOUT 4 PARTS SUGAR TO 6 PARTS
SALTPETER ^ BY THE WAY, POWDERED SUGAR WORKS BEST^. NOW MELT IT OVER LOW FLAME
(LIKE A LIGHTER) (DONT WORRY, IT WONT IGNITE) UNTIL IT IS LIQUID, THEN POUR
IT INTO CONTAINERS AND STICK MATCHES OR FUSE DOWN IN IT, LET IT DRY, AND HAVE
FUN!!

  D.MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
    1.WHAT YA NEED
      a.6 OZ. BOTTLE WSSCREW ON CAP
      b.GUNPOWDER
      c.TOILET PAPER
      d.CANDLE
      e.WATER PROOF FUSE
      f.RUBBING ALCOHOL
      g.PAINT THINNER
      h.LIGHTER FLUID (THE KIND YOU USE         TO START A CHARCOAL GRILL)

   WHAT TA DO:
ROLL THE GUNPOWDER IN THE TP TO MAKE ABOUT A 1 IN. BALL. DRIP WAX ON IT AND
STICK THE FUSE INTO IT. FILL THE BOTTLE 133 OF THE WAY WITH EACH OF THESE:
 RUBBING ALCOHOL, PAINT THINNER, LIGHTER FLUID. SUSPEND THE BALL IN THE MIXTURE
AND PUT ON THE CAP. LIGHT THE FUSE AND THROW THE SHIT OUT OF IT, IF YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR HAND!

HOW TO MAKE M-80'S

MAKING THE POWDER:
1 PT. POWDERED SULFUR
1 PT. POWDERED ALUMINUM
2 PTS. POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE
^DO NOT USE POTASSIUM CHLORATE, IT WILL BLOW UP WHEN MIXED WSSULFUR^

  TRY TO GET SOME CARDBOARD TUBES THAT REGISTER RECIEPT TAPE IS IN, OR JUST DO
YOUR BEST TO FIND SOMRTHING SIMILAR. ANYWAY, POUR THE POWDER MIXTURE INTO
THE TUBE AND SEAL THE BOTTOM AND TOP WITH GLUE, AND STICK THE FUSE DOWN IN
ONE END WHEN
IT IS STILL WET. THEN FIRE AWAY AFTER IT DRIES!!


WITH THE NEXT PHEW PAGES:

AGAIN, WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE USE OF THIS INFORMATION...WE INTEND
THIS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY! (BUT IF YOU DO MAKE THIS SHIT,
-->BE FUCKING CAREFUL!!<---

	NOW ON TO THE GOOD SHIT!

	    UNSTABLE EXPLOSIVE:

1) MIX SOLID NITRIC IODINE WITH
    HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA
2) WAIT OVERNIGHT
3) POUR OFF THE LIQUID
4) DRY MUD ON BOTTOM TO MUD
5) THROW A ROCK AT IT!


ELECTRICALLY IGNITED EXPLOSIVE

MIX: 7 PARTS POTASSIUM CHLORATE
     W  1 PART VASELINE

IGNITE W  ELECTRIC CHARGE
OR FUSE.....

   CAR BOMB--HOW TO REALLY PISS
   SOMEONE OFF...WHEN THIER CAR BLOWS
   UP!

  POUR LIQUID DRANO INTO A PRESCRIBTION
PILL BOTTLE...CLOSE THE LID AND POP IT
INTO VICTIM'S GAS TANK (PLEASE DONT DO IT
WHEN THIER IN THE CAR...WE DONT WANT THEM
TO GET TOO PISSED, NOW DO WE?  AND RUN YOUR
ASS OFF!

    PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES

MIX 2 PARTS VASELINE, 1 PART GASOLINE
AND IGNITE WITH ELECTRIC CHARGE.

    GREEN GODDESS

1)MIX ZINC ([NOT ZINC OXIDE!!])AND
SULFUR (S) 122 AND 122.
2) MAKE SURE THAT YOU MIX THEM VERY WELL.THE BEST WAY TO DO SO, IS TO PUT THE MIXTURE IN A JAR WITH ID AND SHAKE IT UP FOR 15-60 SECONDS,UNTIL IT IS A GREYISH COLOR.
3)TO IGNITE, USE A FUSE, OR THROW A MATCH INTO THE POWDER.
	===>WARNING<===
THIS BURNS VERY QUICKLY,AND PRODUCES SMOKE. ALSO IT BURNS AT A VERY HIGH
TEMPERATURE.IT WILL SUPRISE YOU WHEN YOU THROW A MATCH INTO IT.THERE WILL BE A
DELAY,THEN ALL THE SUDDEN, IT WILL FLASH UP, AND CAN BURN THE HELL OUT OF
YOU!!!!!!!

    FLAMING TRAILS

1)MIX 1 PART POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE AND 1 PART SUGAR TOGETHER
2)SPREAD THIN TRAIL OF IT ON NEIGHBORS SIDEWALK AND RING DOORBELL
3)DROP A DROP OF SULFURIC ACID ON THE TRAIL
4)RUN LIKE HELL!!!
  TENNIS BALL CANON
1)TAKE THE ENDS OFF 3 TIN CANS AND PUNCH A HOLE IN THE SIDE TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE LAST ONE.
2)TAPE THEM TOGETHER WITH THE ONE WITH THE HOLE IN THE SIDE AT THE BOTTOM
3)TAKE SOME LIGHTER FLUID,PUT IT IN AND SHAKE VIGOROUSLY
4)PUT THE TENNIS BALL IN AND TOUCH A MATCH TO IT
5)DONT POINT IT AT ANYONE YOU DONT WANT TO DIE.

    WATER SENSITIVE FIRE STARTERS

1)TAKE 4 PARTS AMMONIUM NITRATE AND MIX THEM WITH 2 PARTS ZINC DUST AND 1 PART AMMONIUM CHLORIDE
2)GET MOIST......FIRE !!!!!!
