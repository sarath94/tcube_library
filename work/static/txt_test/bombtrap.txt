                                 THE ROAD TRAP
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first trap I will discuss is a basic road trap.  You need a wire-trap
action to complete the electrical circuit.  It is extremely simple to make,
since all the equipment can be gathered in or around your house.  The great
advantage to this is that it will explode when the car is directly over it. So
insuring maximum destruction.

                                            +-------OTHER WIRE----------------

To construct the road trap start by digging three holes across the road. In
two of the holes place the explosive charges, and in the third place a regular
car battery.  Connect the first wire from the negative terminal of the battery
via each of the blasting caps, in each charge, to a metal pin on one side of
an ordinary clothes pin. The second wire should be directly connected from the
positive terminal on the battery to the opposite metal pin on the same clothes
pin. The clothes pin must be kept open by a small wooden wedge, which is
attached to a thin black wire (rope) stretched across the road. When the semi-
invisible wire is pulled the wedge will be pulled out of the clothes pin thus
closing the clothes pin. When the clothes pin is closed the two metal pins
will connect and complete the electrical circuit, thus exploding the charges.

                                 WALK TRAP
##############################################################################

This incorporates the same type of wire-trap action as in the road trap. The
walk trap is not electrically operated, it relies on a percussion detonator.
When the wire is pilled it pulls the safety pin out of the heavy firing pin.
The heat created by the detonators explosion will be sufficient to set off the
tnt.  This type of trap is especially good for dense forest area, where the
wire cannot be seen.

                                   BOOK TRAP
##############################################################################

To construct this you will need a large book, perhaps about a thousand pages.
The book should be hollowed out, leaving the edges intact.  In the hollow
place, put a dry cell and your explosive,and connect the wires. Fix two metal
contact points to the edges of the book, and seperate them with a wooden
wedge, which is attached to the rear wall of the bookcase. This must be
acomplished in such a manner that, when the book is removed from the shelf the
two metal contact points will touch and complete the electrical circuit, thus
causing the detonation of the explosive charge.

                                 DOOR HANDLE TRAPS
##############################################################################

There are two basic methods of booby-trapping door handles the first employs a
short test tube, a cork, two needles, three wires, one electrical blasting
cap, one metal ball bearing, and one stick of dynamite. The two needles are
pushed through the cork to an equal length, and the ball bearing is placed in
the tube. The test tube is corked and taped to a door handle. The wires are
then connected from the eyes of the two needles to the battery, with one wire
going via the blasting cap. Next, the battery and stick of dynamite are taped
to the back of the door. When the handle is turned the ball bearing will roll
and touch both of the needles, thus completing the electrical circuit and
exploding the dynamite.  The second door-handle trap is much the same, except
it uses a mercury thermostat switch, rather than a ball bearing.

            ##############             ###############

They should both be at a slight angle so that the ball bearing is not touching
both of the needles and the mercury is not touching both wires. And rember
that most people that are normal turn the handle from the outside in a clock-
wise motion so make sure you dont place the detonator backwards.

                             FLOOR BOARD TRAPS
##############################################################################

The loose floorboard utilizes the same principles as the book trap , in that
it relies on two metal contact points touching to complete the electrical
circuit.  Beneath the loose floorboard are two strips of pliable metal or
bamboo, each with a metal contact point, which will touch when preasure is
brought down on the loose floorboard.

##############################################################################

Well there are many kinds of detonators I will only discuss three in this
file.  Well there is the common fuse which is usually a black-powder core
surronded with a fabric and then a layer of water resistent material.  However
there are many different types it can generally be said that safety fuses burn
between 30 and 45 seconds a foot; however check these figures when you make
your purchase.  Bombs can be detonated in many ways  the detonation and use of
certain devices are based mainly on the cleverness and the imagination of the
saboteur.  Well the next detonation device I will discuss is the electrical
detonator which requires either a solar igniter or just a thin wire.  Well if
you just have a piece of wire make sure it is all covered with plastic except
for a small part about a half and inch or so. So when you connect the wire to
the battery each side of the wire to each side of the battery. T the wire
should get very hot depending on the size an amout of batteries you are using.
Just the part where there is no covering should get the hottest and that is
teh part that you will stick into the explosive.  There are many ways you can
use this so use your imagination.  The next type of detonation device i will
discuss is a nonelectrical blasting cap.  You need a blasting cap for alot of
the more powerful explosives like tnt.  A blasting cap is a low explosive
compound that is connected to a high explosive, for the purpose of detonating
it,to use the nonelectrical blasting cap one gently pushes the fuse into the
hollow end, until it is in fully.  He then crimps the metal end around the
fuse and puts it in the high explosive.  When the fuse burns down it ignites
the flash charge which in turn explodes the priming charge, which detonates
the base charge, and finally creates enough heat to set off the high explosive
charge.  The fuse is an ordinary safety fuse which I already discussed or a
detonating cord.  When the fuse is put into the blasting cap, it is necessary
to seal it.  This act of sealing is called crimping.  When involved with this
sort of thing, one must use the standard precautions. Crimpers look like a
pair of pliars, and there function is very similiar although pliers cannot be
used for crimping.  With the crimper in your right hand and the blasting cap
in your left, slowly squeez the hollow end of the blasting cap, as this may
detonate it.
