Common Rocket Fuel
------------------
Materials:

1. Potassium Nitrate (Saltpeter). This can be obtained from a drugstore or
   a chemical supply house.

2. Sugar (Powdered is the best)

Procedure:

1. Mix the two together 1/2 Nitrate and 1/2 sugar.

2. Take an old cooking pan, and melt the two together. There is no way for
   it to ignite.

3. It should turn into a fudgey looking compound. Pour this compound into a
   rocket engine such as a cardboard tube, and set a fuse into the compound
   and let the compound harden.

CHLORATE MIXTURES
-----------------

NOTE: The main ingredient for this experiment is potassium or sodium clorate.
      both of these will do equally well. However, both may prove difficult to
      find. Probably the only way to obtain it would be to order it from a
      chemical supply house.

Materials:

1. Potassium Chlorate or Sodium Chlorate

2. Powdered Charcoal

3. Powdered Aluminum

4. Sulfur

Procedure:

NOTE:  There is no set procedure for making Chlorate Mixtures. The only special
       thing about Chlorate mixtures is that they have Chlorate in them.
       Experiment with different proportions of each of the ingredients. All of
       the Chlorate Mixtures I have made had no set procedure and I just
       experimented with the proportions of each of the ingredients. Most of
       your mixture, however, should be Potassium Chlorate and Sodium
       Chlorate.

1.  Make sure that you mix the Sulfur and Charcoal and Aluminum first. You
    may grind these in a mortar and pestal to get a good mix of these
    ingredients.

2.  Add Potassium Chlorate or Sofium Chlorate. Mix them very carefully in
    the mortar and pestal. Do NOT grind the mixture once the Chlorate has
    been added or it will ignite and burn the SHIT out of you!

3.  You now may use the mixture for whatever you want to. Chlorate mixtures
    are some of the best compositions there are andm in my experiences,
    they are the best except for model rocket propellent (Procedure for
    making this is given later).

-----------------

Materials:

1.  Zinc (ZN) <---NOTE: This is NOT the same as Zinc Oxide!

2.  Sulfur (S)


Procedure:

1.  Mix the two together 1/2 and 1/2.

2.  Make sure that you mix them very well. The best way to do so is to put
    the mixture in a jar with a lid and shake it for 15-60 seconds, untill
    it is all a greenish color.

3.  To ignite, use a fuse, or throw a match into the powder. WARNING, this
    burns very quickly, and produces smoke. Also, it burns at a fairly high
    temperature. It will surprise you when you throw a match into it. There
    will be a delay, and then all of the sudden, it will flash up, and is
    capable of burning the hell out of you.

Common Uses
-----------

1. Rocket Fuel

2. Bomb - Note: The best way to do this is to take it and compress it into
   cardboard tubing.

3. Smoke Bombs (Cardboard tube with big hole)

4. Flare Bombs

The rest is up to your imagination...
