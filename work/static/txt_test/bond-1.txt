File:James Bond Pen
 
Second file: James Bond pen out of Moonraker. Can hold about .2-.1 cc
poison.
 
Needs:                  plastic retractable ball pt. pen
                        1cc Tuberculin syringe (about .7cm diam. or 1/4in)
                                               (needle:1cm or 3/8 in. long)
                        razor blades
                        cm. or in. ruler
 
 
   To make:     Cut about 1/4 in. or .7cm off end of syringe tube.
                Generally make the tube streamlined.
                Take insides out of pen.
                Sheer off tip of pen until you can push the syringe in
with light pressure and have all the needle,but nothing else, protruding
from the tip.
                Cut a mark in the syringe where pen meets syringe.
                Remove syringe. Screw the sides of the pen together.
                Cut pen in two at meeting place of two halves.
                Take the moving parts of the pen ( the 'clicker') out.
                Cut off all protrusions (parts that look like the fins
on a rocket)
                Glue all parts together like they were originally.
                That part will now be called the clicker.
                Cut the 'push' flat part off the top of the plunger.
                Cut the plunger so it is about 3/8 in. from the top
of the tube when inserted all the way.
                Whittle the tip of the plunger so it will fit loosely
in the clicker.
                Plunger end first, GENTLY push the tube into the clip-on
end of the pen as far as it will go, with moderate pressure.
                Mark the place where pen meets tube.
                Remove the tube, measure the distance between the two
marks, and cut that much off the end of the tube.
                Cut and whittle the plunger again.
                Place the clicker in the clip end.
                Insert the plunger to about .4cc and gently push into
the clip end. You should be able to push the clicker and make the plunger
move all the way down to empty. If not, modify further.
                Cut a piece of plastic or paper about 2cm or 7/8in
wide, big enough to wrap around the biggest part of the pen.
                Tape it so it forms a sheath or tube and paint to
match the pen, like a sheath to cover the gap between the ends when the
pen is not armed.
 
 
You now have a working replica of the Jame Bond pen. To use, remove the
syringe parts and fill with about .4cc liquid (good poison of course).
Push the plunger end in the clip end as far as it will go. Some liquid
should squirt out, which is okay, as long as there is .1-.2cc left.
Take the other end of the pen and push it over the syringe and into the
sheath. You should place it so the needle is almost extending out of the
end, but not quite.
   To use: One-handed, holding with tclip on part (not touching
the clicker), slide the two ends together. The needle should slide out.
Stab, depress clicker. The syringe should inject its venom.
 
 
4) Molded Bricks That Burn
 
   Propartions are 3 parts aluminum powder, 4 parts water and 5 parts plaster of
paris.  Mix the aluminum and plaster thoroughly together, then add the water and
stir vigorously. Pour the resulting mix into a mold, let harden, and then dry fo
r 2 to 3 weeks. These blocks are hard to ignite, and take a long time to make, b
ut when ignited on mild steal, they have a tendancy to melt it.
 
5) The Fire Bottle
 
  Fill a good Jack Daniel's bottle about one-fifthto one-fourth full with sulfur
ic acid.Fill the remainder with gasoline, kerosine, or a good combination of the
two and mix thoroughly.  Add water to Potassium Chlorate and sugar mix, and soap
k rags in the mix.Wrap the rags around the bottle, tie in place, and allow to d
ry.  When thrown at a T-62 or other target, the bottle will break, the acid will
ignite the chlorate-sugar mix on the rags, which will ignite the fuel. Great for
 parties , impress your friends!
 
6) Molotov Cocktails
 
  It's amazing to me how many people DON'T know the proper way of making the eas
iest thing in the book. These toys do not 'explode' per say, they just spread ar
ound the fuel and,if your lucky the oil/gas mix combusts enough to give you a li
ttle "boom".  A two to one ratio of gas to oil works nicely.  Napalm can also be
used, or jelly gas is fine.
