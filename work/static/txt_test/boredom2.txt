Dealing with Bitches
--------------------
Call up a girl whose a real bitch and make sure her parents answer.  Then
talking very nervously explain to her parent that you and her daughter had a
relationship and it ended when you got her pregnant and that your really
sorry then hang up.  Some kids did this to this girl I know and her mother
grounded her ass.  Now she isn't allowed to answer the phone if there is a
boy on the other end.

Lawn Fun
--------
Get hold of a lawn fertilizer, fill it with salt and spread across some
pecker's lawn.  About 2 months later, no lawn.

Obstacles
---------
If the mark is very private and lives in a house where the garage is part of
the house and they own one of those garage door openers.  Place things in
front of the doors so when they back out, they go right over it.  Me and a
friend took this guys love chair and put one leg of it in the handle of the
garage door. The next morning it busted his garage door opener and he
couldn't get his car out so he had to take a taxi to work.

Parked Cars
-----------
Get a couple of car jacks and place them under a car right under the axle then
raise it so that the wheel is just off the ground.

Porch Raiders
-------------
Go to some ones house with a couple of friends all armed with eggs, ring the
door bell and when someone comes to the door throw the eggs!

Gardens
-------
Now that it is spring people are starting to plant fruits and vegtables, when
they are ripe have a feast or take some veggies and do Porch Raiders
subsituding the eggs for their crop!

Getting Caught
--------------
No one wants to but stuff like this is easy to start but hard to stop.  Always
carry something so that if someone comes up you have a chance.  I carry a
substance that is corrosive to the eyes.  If you are unfortunate enough to get
caught everyone gang up on the person and beat the shit out of them.

Cookouts
--------
Find a cookout and go up and say "Hi, food almost done?"  Basically invite
yourself to everything.  If done the right way the people will be totally
baffeled!  Or if there is one at night and no one outside around the grill go
and take all the food!
