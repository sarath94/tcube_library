Bottle Bomb

Ingredients:

   * 20 oz soda bottle (empty and dry on the inside)
   * black powder (the more fine the better)
   * steady burning long wick (at least 15 seconds delay) Instructions:

        o Poke a small hole in the cap of the soda bottle.
        o Pour a small amount of black powder into the bottle (just enough
          to cover the bottom with a thin layer, but totally covered, no
          empty spots on the bottom).
        o Insert wick into the cap about halfway and put a bend in the
          wick.
          Note: Be careful not to break the wick or it will shorten it
          causing possibly disastrous results.
        o Screw the cap on the bottle tightly and set somewhere so that it
          is standing up.
        o Light the fuse and get back about 30 feet. Watch the bottle to
          light up orange. The second after this happens the bottle blows
          up.

     How it works:
     The fuse drops onto the layer of black powder in the bottom of the
     bottle after it burns through the hole. The wick ignites the powder
     causing it to burn. This builds up pressure inside the bottle causing
     it to explode. I have seen these fly up to 25 feet. You can try
     experimenting with different size bottles or, try a glass bottle with
     a metal cap if you have steel balls!!! Note- I'm not sure it has
     enough pressure to blow a glass bottle apart. It may just act like a
     rocket engine and flare.
