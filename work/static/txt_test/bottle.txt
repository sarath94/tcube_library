Go down to a hobby shop and buy some Estes rocket engines and some small
dowels, you can make these babies.  Attach the
dowel to the rocket casing with tape or glue and be SURE to plug you the top
end of the engine so you get a bigger bang for your money.  Epoxy works well
for this.  The great thing about it is that they go VERY FAST and VERY FAR.
The speed is enough to knock out anything easily.  You can go for A, B, C, or D
engines but remember that the heavier and more powerful the engine, the longer
the dowel you will need.  Buy the C6-7 engines with a 6 second burn and 7
second delay for discharge.
