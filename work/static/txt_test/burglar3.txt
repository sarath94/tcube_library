===============================================================================

CAN I KICK IT!?!

 In Part Three, we will dicuss the variety of systems that are monitored by a
central station. Rather than announcing an intrusion (via bell,siren,etc.),
this type of system silently sends a signal to the alarm company where people
are monitoring for intrusions. This type of system, therefore, is often known
as the "silent alarm." Although one can obtain his objective by bypassing the
individual components of a local alarm system, when bypassing this type, one
must shut off the entire system to be successful. The employees of the central
station are led to believe that the alarm is being shut off by authorized
personnel. 

 I. THE CENTRAL STATION

 A few years ago, rich homeowners, business owners, and other potential
targets for burglary, had alarms systems that were tied in directly to the
local police ststion. As the use of burglar alarms increased, the police
department began turning down more and more requests to be "hooked-up." As a
result, there became a demand for central stsions, or companies whose 
specialty it was to simply monitor burglar alarms. Most police departments
will still allow banks and large jewelry stores a direct link to the police
station, but as a rule, homeowners are excluded. So as the demand for security
has risen, many guard agencies and burglar alarm insttallers have begun to
offer centralized monitoring as an option for their clients.
 When a silent alarm is installed, it is connected by a dedicated telephone
line to the central station. In event of an intrusion, the control panel on
the premises being monitored calls up to the central station. In the event of
an intrusion, the cotrol panel on the premises being monitored calls up the
central station and gives an electronic message to the answering computer.
    (All you hacks & phreaks should have a nice big bulb lit!!)
It tells the computer exactly which switch or sensor has been violated, and
the computer then tells the operator what has happened. For example if a
burglar enetered throuhg a broken window, the panel would call the computer up
and tell it that zone 4, a first floor window, has been broken. The operator
would then see on his computer screen that Acct. #1234, the Johnson residence
has had zone 4, the window foiling on the living room window, violated. As the
theif progressed through the house, the panel would call the computer for 
every sensor that was violated. The operator may then receive 1234-17,
meaning that zone 17, a passive Infra-Red dector in the master bedroom, has
detected someone. The operator would then be fairly sure someone was in the 
house, so he would have three options. He may just send his companies guards
to the scene, call 911 and dispatch the police, or he may send both the police
and the guards. (I'll tell you how to deal with the both of them later.)
   When an authorized person enters through the designated entry/exit door,he
goes directly to the control panel. Using a key, or his push-button code, he
shuts the system off. If he enters at a strange hour, he must call the central
station and give them his password or code phrase. And so, since the system was
properly disarmed, the central station operator then pays no more attention to
that particular account for the rest of the night. Because of the time delay,
the owner is able to shut it off before the panel has time to call up the
central station's computer.  This, coupled with the fact that the owner calls
the central station to give them his code, supposedly guarantees against foul
play. The premise here is that even if a burglar can get to the panel, and
shut it off, he will not know the code word. I suppose the people who think
that must have never herd of bugs or telephone taps, not to mention laser
surveillance devices, parabolic and directional microphones, or the "Oops, I
forgot my coat last night" (which contained a voice-operated tape recorder)
trick. The entry/exit door is another safeguard against illegal entry. It is
designated by the owner at the time of the installation, to be the ONLY
method of entrance when the alarm is armed. That doesn't mean that the owner
always obeys this, but it causes the central station operator to be a bit
more suspicious if someone shuts off an alarm, but does not enter through it.
Since the best way to bypass a monitored alarm is to appear to be authorized
to do so, a burglar usually doeas some surveillance to determine the entry/
exit door.
    A central station has an immense amount of control over the security of its
city. The central station keeps blueprints (containing alarm design) of 
clients' buildings, the master codes and codewords for all alarms, and it
sometimes even keeps a copy of their keys. It also knows when their clients
are out of town, and how long they will be gone for. I'll show you how to
gain access to the central stations weakness and how to exploite it later on
in the GUERRILLA TACTICS section.
     It would greatly benefit a thief if he knew whether or not a system was
monitored, and if so, by whom. Ordinarily, a security puts its sticker on the
doors and windows of a monitored house or business. The thief could look
through the local Yellow Pages, to find out if the company is legit, and also
how long it may take the guards to respond to a call. A common way to test 
this is to throw a rock through a window. If a bell sounds its most likely a 
local alarm, if there is no sound but cops arrive moments later, it is
monitored. After a house or business has been determined to have a monitored
system, there are several ways to determine the company that monitors it.
Let's say that the proposed target is Movie Rental at 716 Broadway Street.
One could call every alarm company in the Yellow Pages, and say,"This is the
police department, do you monitor Movie Rental on Broadway?" Usually, an 
answer will be given, but a reason for wanting to know should be prepared.
Presumably, one company will eventually say that they do indeed monitor
Movie Rental on Broadway. Another way to  find out who monitord Movie Rental
is to strike up a conversation with the proposed victim, and ask him to 
recommend a security company. A less risky way is to throw a rock through the
containing foil, and see how comes out to fix it. The name of the company is
usually written on the side of the car or truck for advertisement, but if not
the license plate is run through the DMV computer (see the A-CORP newletters
for more info on this.) In rural or suburban areas, one could also check the
homeowner's mail for the alarm company's bill.
     An alarm company not only monitors for intrustions, but also for 
tampering and sabotage. Cutting the telephone lines, the power lines, or
tampering with the control panel, will bring the cops just as fast as breaking
down the door. Although leaving the telephone off the hook will prevent the 
alarm company from contacting the house, it will not keep the control panel
from contacting the company's computer, because it features a "line seizure"
mechanism. That means that no matter what happens, the alarm signal will get
through to the central station's computer.
 
 II. PREAMPLIFIED MICROPHONES

       The preamplified microphone, or preamp, as it is called, is usually a
small black box that sits in a centralized location, and listens for anything
out of the ordinary. Many companies, notably Sonitrol Security, utilize
preamps in addition to regular components. When the system is armed, the
preamplifier sends sounds (via telephone wires) to the central station. The
preamp can pick up the slightest noise, so that tell-tale sounds of a 
burglary betray the burglar even if the other components do not. The preamp
does not know the difference between  the sounds of burglary and everyday
noises, so it also sends barking dogs, sirens,telephone rings,and virious
other "harmless" noises into the ears of the central station operator.
     Although they are sometimes dectected with high-quality bug dectectors,
it is often quite diffcult to know whether or not they are being used.
However, if a thief knows (or thinks) a preamplifier is being used, they are
quite easily overcome. If , prior to execution, one calls the residence or
business, the ringing will continue until the burglar arrives. If the burglar
is very quiet, the ringing will mask the noise that he is making, and the 
listener will be none the wiser. Also a tape recording of a siren or barking
dog is often used to create the same effect.
     Some security supply companies sell sound generator or jamming device
that nullifies bugs and other microphones, but the interference that this
creates may arouse undue suspicion, so it may not be practical for all 
circumstances. One method that is practical, however, is the use of a CB 
linear. If a CB radio that is connected to a powerful linear (over 250 watts)
is used near a preamplifier, the only thing that the operator at the central 
station will hear is the CB conversation. You may think that this shit would
arouse suspicion but when we used it, it didn't! because this shit happens
all the time. Everytime a trucker with a powerful CB radio passes by a home
or business with a preamp this phenomenon happens (cool huh?).
      Since preamplified microphones also capture the sound of an authorized
entry, the code is usually just given aloud upon entering, so the operator
can shut off his system. This code, then, is extremely easy to obtain.

III. POLICE AND GUARD RESPONSES

     Although a burglar may proceed with caution, defeat every alarm component
in sight, and shut off the whole alarm panel, there is still a chance that he
may make a mistake. If the mistake is insignificant, no one ever knows about it,
and his mission comes off smoothly, but if the mistake raises the suspicion of
the central operator, it may result in the dispatch of guards or police to the
premises. The professional burglar recognizes this possiblity, and  often 
takes steps to minimize the risks and dangers of getting caught. With enough
planning, not only will his mission be accomplished, but the burglar will also
probaly escape.
     If a burglar creates a silent alarm, or otherwise arouses the suspicion
of the operator, the police, guards or both, may be sent. If the alarm
company has its own mobile guards, it will dispatch them to the scene via
radio. This radio frequency is easily discovered by networking with scanner
enthusiasts, or by writting FCC. Once the freq is procured, the burglar can
listen to and follow every move of the guards. If the guards are headquartered
at the central station, a friend can keep the place under surveillance, and
watch the guards activities. If they suddenly go to their vehicles, and 
proceed toward the place being burglarized, the 'friend' will notify the 
burglar  by walkie-talkie. (I know of someone that did this and invested $300
for walkie talkies and it turned out that they were the same ones used by the
guards so he just monitered his walkie-talkie during the whole mission!)
If the potential take is large enough, burglars may even have several cars
strategically placed along all possible routes that guards and police must use
to arrive at the scene. If they observe anything relevent, they will notify
the burglar. They may also bug the central station (see GUERRILLA TACTICS) to
determine whether or not the guards will be sent.
     If a company does not have guards, or if they feel the police would be
better equipped to handle the situation, they may just call 911. The operator
will talk to the police department's dispatcher and tell him/her that he has
an "alarm drop" at such-and-such address. The police dispatcher will then
notify a nearby unit, by radio, that he received a call from XYZ Security, 
and that he should go and check it out. The burglar, who also has a scanner
preset to the police frequency, has also been notified, and is mysteriously
gone when the police arrive. The freq of local police departments are easily
obtained from fellow scanner listeners, or from Radio Shack frequency guides.
     While the above will work in most cases, there may be times when a guard
or policeman arrives, without the burglar knowing about it. If this occurs,
it is usually during a routine check. This, however, is so incredibly rare
that the chances of being caught in this manner are almost nil. 
     If a burglar thinks that he has a chance of getting caught, he may get
authentic or counterfeit credentials and documents that provide a plausible
excuse for his being there. Willie Sutton, the famous bank robber, even went
so far as to make a complete, but phony, police uniform to throw everyone
off his trail. This technique would obviously have its uses in housebreaking
as well.
     Professional burglars also know better than to hide on the premises to
avoid capture. After the guards and police arrive, and verify an actual point
of entry (POE), the police department will bring out its K9 unit to "sniff
out" the place. Anyone hiding in the home or businesss will be found in a 
matter of minutes. It seems that thieves would rather take their chances as
a moving target than to be a sitting duck by hidding under a bed. If one
enters in a conventional manner, such as through the front door, he usually
takes care to lock it behind him to give the appearance that nothing has been
disturbed. If a guard or policeman arrives on the scene and doesn't notice
anything suspicious, and doesn't see anyone inside, he will usually proceed
no further, and write it off as a mechanical failure. But if the theif uses
a crowbar to open a door or window then no one will think its a false alarm.
Closing and locking a door behind him also minimizes the risk of being 
caught during a routine door check, which is quite common in some cities.
     Finally, it should be known that professional burglars are acutely
aware that most guards are either 18 and just out of high school, or over
50 and extremely out of shape. Either way, they are poorly paid and very
indifferent to their company and clients. Thwy have no inherent loyalty 
toward their employers, and this generally provides an incredible opportunity
for the resourceful burglar. It is obvious that five thousand dollars in the
hand of a $4.75 per hour security guard will sometimes make him look the
other way for an hour or so.

 IV. TELEVISION MONITORS AND AUTO-DIALERS

    Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras are used around the world to 
keep vigil over areas that are potential scenes of criminal activity. In 
many cases, a guard keeps watch over several monitors, or the cameras are
connected to motion detectors, so that if anything is detected within the
camera's field of view, it would scan for the intruder. The motion detector
system is used when a guard has to monitor such a large number of cameras, it
would be difficult to watch them all simultaneously. CCTVs are frequently seen
in hotel lobbies, at bank teller windows, and other areas where the very 
presence of the camera deters crime. In reality, cameras do very little to
guard against a proffessional burglary.
     In the movies and on television, there is a varity of methods used to 
defeat the lowly CCTV camera. Some thieves spray shaving cream into or tape
cardboard over the lens. MacGyver simply places a mirror in front of the 
camera, and the Mission: Impossible team taps into the coaxial cable, and
delivers a phony picture to the Third World guard. Fortunately, or
Unfortunately, depending on your viewpoint, it is never quite that simple.
CCTV cameras have the uncanny ability to penetrate seemingly opaque objects,
therefore the shaving cream/cardboard method would probably not work. A mirror
placed in front of a lens would be a definite giveaway for an observant
guard that something was askew. Finally, the "tapping into the coax" trick
would involve so many trial and error adjustments that no one could get it 
right the first time, let alone convince a guard that nothing out of the 
ordinary had happened.
     The primary characteristic of a CCTV that allows for easy bypass is its
outstanding visibility. This fact alone allows an observant thief to watch
the scanning rate of the camera, and do his "work" during the periods when the
camera is looking the other way. There are often attempts made to disguise a
CCTV, but any suspicious box aimed at a sensitive area is automatically 
assumed to be a surveillance camera. Sometimes video cameras or slow-speed
Super-8mm cameras are hidden in liquor stores and gas stations, and are turned
on by a hidden switch or foot pedal. These certainly won't deter crime, since
the amateur criminal doesn't know they're there, nor will they apprehend many
professional criminals, since a pro would obviously wear a mask or disguise
during such an operation.
     There are two more techniques for defeating the surveillance camera, and
their use depends om the manner in which it is monitored. If the camera is
connected to a video-tape recorder, the lens may simply be covered with a glob
of modeling clay, or any other moldable opaque substance. If this is done, no
activity in the monitored area will be captured on film. If the camera is 
being monitored in real time by a guard or policeman, an FM oscillator can be
used. If this device is brought anywhere near a TV monitor, the picture will
be reduced to snow and stactic. This device is easy to find and goes for about
$10 my H.T.H. staff got there's from JohnsonSmith catalog it goes under a 
device to fool your friends and mess-up the TV. Look for it in other electronic
catalogs or magazines.
     The auto-dialer is equally worthless in preventing professional burglary.
The auto-dialer is a device that calls a centrsl station or police station on
the telephone and deliveres a short pre-recordeed message that there is a 
burglary in progress. There may be other numbers listed, such as those of
friends and neighbors, in case some of the other calls did not get through.
Modern auto-dialers have a line-seizing mechanism that disallows jamming the
line, by calling the residence prior to the housebreaking, for example. They
are usually hidden and housed in a locked box for added protection, but even
with these safeguards, th evalue of the auto-dialer as a security device,
is practically nil.
     If the alarm that is connected to the dialer cannot be bypassed, the 
telephone lines cannot be cut, and the lock on the housing cannot be picked,
I will give you another way to defeat this system. Since auto-dialers are
silent to the homeowner as well as the burglar, they are party to many false
alarms. This fact has promoted many cities to ban the use of auto-dialers,
since so many police man-hours have been wasted responding to them. In cities
that do allow them the homeowners have been advised to install abort switches
in the home. At least one abort switch, which shuts the dialer off immediatly
will be placed near the dialer, in the bedroom, or near the control panel. Of
course some dialers have a simple on/off switch on them, and they must rely
on concealement alone to beat the burglar. However in the average home, there
are not too many places that one can hide something as large as an auto-dialer.
     Perhaps the quickest way to defeat an auto-dialer is to simply erase the
tape. Since the message is recorded on magnetic tape, an electromagnetic bulk
eraser will leave the tape completely blank.

    V. GUERRILLA TACTICS

  There may be cases when you..oppss I mean when the burglar cannot bypass or
avoid an alarm system, therefore he may have to resort to guerrilla tactics to
accomplish his goal. When I say guerrilla, I mean a method of attack that is
SO unorthodox, no one could possibly expect it. Guerrilla tactics are usually 
aimed at central station employees, or the central station itself, but they
may be also used against the police department, if the need arises.
    Ideally, the central station would be a veritable fortress. The only 
security system that protects the central station is usually a TV camera at
the front door, and a simple local alarm.
     The burglar could bug a police station and learn a great deal, such as
information on potential targets or police schedules. (This also works for
about anything else.. How do you think the High Tech Hoods gets me the down
and dirty info for most files!?!?!)
     On the 4th of July one of my staff members lit 6 half sticks          
with extra long fuses (10 min long) in front of store front glasses and
took off for the real target on the other side of town. When the sticks went
off he was already at his target. The police used about 3 or 4 cars to make
sure that those stores would not be looted while the robbery was taken place
accross town.
