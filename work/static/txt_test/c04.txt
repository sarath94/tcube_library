         Chapter Three: Deception
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

            Well, anyone who  has done anything  similar to the  acts
         described above must  also have  found it  necessary to  lie
         once in a while. Remember that  to get away with lying,  you
         must make the lie seem  like reality. If you convince  your-
         self that it is true then others are more likely to  believe
         you. It's a good idea to  make sure all the people  involved
         in the caper have the exact same story. Alwayz stick to  yer
         story and  never  stray  from it.  Try  to  have  supporting
         evidence on your side too, go for realism! Unfortunately, no
         G-phyle iz gonna turn a lousy liar into a good one...it  has
         to be in yer blood, it does, honest!
