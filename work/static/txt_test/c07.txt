    Introduction:
   --------------


           Assuming that you have read the first phyle in this series and
    that you are a true Anarchist, I'm sure you will find this phyle both
    interesting and useful.  We have compiled some of the easiest to make
    but most  destructive devices in the Anarchist's arsonal of home-made
    weapons and explosives.  A true Anarchist has a remarkable ability to
    overcome any obstacle using only the materials at his disposal.  I am
    not saying that you need to know 100 diferant ways to kill a man with
    a stapler, just that you should be able to get by using  whatever you
    have. This phyle will show you a few ways to increase  your destruc-
    tive power using simple household items. Remeber that there is a cer-
    tain element of risk involved in handling some of the devices which
    you will see, so please use caution. Neither myself nor anyone asso-
    ciated with the creation of this phyle will take any responsibility
    for damage or injury sustained as a result of attemping any of the
    proceedures depicted hereafter.
