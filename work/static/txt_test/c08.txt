                              The Motor Mine
_____________________________________________________________________________



    Motor Mine:    This device causes basically the same damage as the
    -----------    "basic mine", but it is more convenient if the intended
                   victim happens to miss stepping on it.


    Materials:     Film Cannister ( or any container )
    ----------
                   Match Books ( 17 fill a Black's film cannister )

                   Wire ( preferably long lengths )

                   Small Electric Motor

                   Battery & Pushbutton Switch


    Method:
    -------

         First, take the lid of your container and make a small hole in it.
    This should be big enough to hold the axle of the motor snuggly.  You
    need to make a small cardboard disk or,  if you can find one,  a small
    plastic gear-like piece meant to fit on an electric motor. You have to
    cover this small disk ( about 1 cm. wide ) with the brimstone from the
    matchbooks. Fill the container with match-heads, push the motor's axle
    through the lid and push the disk onto the axle from the other side.
    Now put on the lid and tape the whole thing up, plus the motor so it
    doesn't wobble around. Hook your wire up to the terminals on the motor
    and then to a switch or a baattery or whatever. Conceal the mother and
    stand back. You will hear a high pitched screach of the motor grinding
    and then BOOM!  Works well.

                                 Time Bomb
_____________________________________________________________________________


         This device isn't too hard to make, but it does have a limitation.
    It doesn't work on the principle that the time you set it to is when it
    goes off, it's more of a mechanical thing....just read.


    Materials:
    ----------

                   o Some sort of container
                   o Wooden Matches ( 17 boxes fill a film cannister but if
                                    you want a bigger bomb, buy about 50 or
                                    so boxes and fill a 2ltr. pop bottle.
                   o Small Electric Motor
                   o Friction Disk ( see previous phyle "motor mine" )
                   o Wire
                   o Battery ( 9 volt should do it )
                   o Cheap Clock with hands
                   o Electrical Tape

    Method:
    -------
                   1) Make the "motor mine" explained above.
                   2) Instead of both leads going straight to the battery,
                      you will have a clock in between, with the faceplate
                      taken off.
                   3) Tie the positive and negative leads to the clock hands
                      and set them to an appropriare distance appart.
                   4) When the hands meet, this will complete the circuit
                      which will start the motor. The Friction disk will spin
                      and rub against the matchheads and KABOOM!!

    Note:  To increase the power of this device, gun powder may be added to
           The match-heads to fill the container.


    Here's a Diagram:                                   __________

         You can see the limitations in the way of time. Basically, all you
    have to make sure of, is that what evr amount of time you want the bomb
    to go off in, the two hands will meet after that amount of time.  There
    might be a way to create a more accurate  timing system using a digital
    clock but that is in theoretical stages only.

                                Napalm Bomb
_____________________________________________________________________________


           Napalm is, in itself a very simple substance.  It can be used for
    in the construction of many simple explosive weapons. Here's a good one:

         Materials:
         ----------     Gasoline            Dishsoap (Joy is good)
                        A Nail              Ammonia Pellets
                        A Drill             Flexible Wire
                        A Coke can

         Procedure:
         ----------

    [1]  First, make a mixture fo 1/2 Dish-soap and 1/2 Gasoline.
    [2]  Cut the top off of the Coke can and fill it with the mixture.
    [3]  Take the drill and put a hole in the ammonia pellet big enough so
         that the nail can fit through it.
    [4]  Put the nail through the pellet and wire it to the top of the can
         so that the nail can be slipped out easily, allowing the pelet to
         drop into the mixture.
    [5]  Attatch some string or fishing line to the nail head and detonate
         from a distance by pulling the string.


     WARNING:   DO NOT LET THAT PELLET FALL INTO THE MIXTURE UNTIL YOU ARE
     SAFE OR YOUR WIFE WILL SOON BECOME A WIDOW ! Wait until you are ready
     to set it off to pull the string.....It should look like this:


                                       Ammonia Pellet
                                      /

                             Das Crackkerwork!
_____________________________________________________________________________


    Das Crakkerwork:   A neat way to scare the shit out of someone and to
    ----------------   cause moderate amounts of damage.

    Materials:         o A rocket engine (The bigger the better but class
    ----------                            A will do fine)
                       o A fire cracker

                       o Tape

                       o A kick-ass nature

         First, take the engine, it will have one hollow end and the other
    end is filled with the rocket fuel (it resembles clay).  Take a screw-
    driver or something hard and start grinding up the substance from the
    inside.

         Don't grind up the thing totally though. Now put the fire cracker
    inside the engine, witht the fuse sticking out of the convenient hole.
    (The hole is usually used for solar flares).

        Now tape up the son of a bitch so that it's black an' mean looking.

        Finally, light it and throw it, the fire cracker will go off ( but
    won't damage the engine ), then the engine will ignite and go whipping
    around. It makes a lot of ruckus and the exhaust can cause damage.

              1) Pour a 1/2 inch layer of motor oil into the coffee can.
              2) Pour in some gun powder ( The more, the merrier )
              3) Cut a 6" diameter circle of metal screening and poke a
                 small hole in the center of it.
              4) Place the screen on top of the can and secure it.
              5) Insert a dry fuse or oiled rag through the screen so
                 that it reaches the bottom of the can.
              6) Light the fuse.

    This device will produce extremely large amounts of smoke and flame.

                            How To Make A Fuse
_____________________________________________________________________________



       One reason for which many well made bombs fail is the lack of a good
    fuse. To make a dry fuse, you will need the following:

              o Several sheets of tissue paper (The kind used for machee)
              o Gasoline/Carosine
              o Gunpowder
              o A paint brush
              o Patience

     Method:
    ---------

              1) Use the paint brush to apply a thin film of gasoline on a
                 sheet of tissue paper.
              2) Let dry
              3) Sprinkle a thin line of gunpowder onto the paper
              4) Roll the paper up tightly from one end
              5) Apply a few more layers by repeating steps 1&2 and rolling
                 each new layer around the existing fuse.
              6) Let the whole thing sit for a couple of hours
              7) Apply a final coating of gasoline with the paintbrush
              8) After it is completely dry, it will work beautifully


     Note:
    -------   Experiments are currently being done in an attempt to design
              a fuse which will burn under water.

                         Tennis Ball Grenade
_____________________________________________________________________________


         Most of you have probably heard of the Tennins Ball Bomb. It is a
    handy explosive or noisemaker. The Tennis Ball Grenade is based on the
    same idea but does more damage.


    You will need the following:

         1) A Tennis Ball
         2) A Knife
         3) Several boxes of wooden matches (not safety matches)
         4) Hockey Tape
         5) Gunpowder
         6) A Sparkler
         7) Flint

    Method:
    -------

         1) Cut a small round hole in the ball with the knife
         2) Take the flint (the kind used for flip-top lighters) and crush
            it into a powder
         3) Separate the wire handle from the sparkler and grind it up
         4) Mix the flint and sparkler powder together with gunpowder
         5) Pour the mixture into the tennis ball
         6) Cut off the match-heads and pack the ball with them until you
            can't fit anymore into it.
         7) Use the tape to cover the hole completely
         8) The grenade will explode on contact with any solid surface,
            producing large amounts of flame and flaming projectiles.
         9) [optional] For a delayed blast grenade, insert a dry fuse into
            the hole before you tape it up.

    These babies are easy to make, light weight, conceilable and do plenty
    of damage for their size....in general, a kick-ass weapon. You can make
    dozens of them for hours of enjoyment.

                              The Boom-Box
_____________________________________________________________________________


         The Boom-Box is simple to make and is very effective. It is an anti-
    personnel device and works on one or more victims.


    Materials:
    ----------

              o A metal box with a hinged lid
              o String
              o A mouse trap
              o C-4 or any volatile plastic explosive
              o Tape

    Procedure:
    ----------

              1) Secure the mousetrap to the bottom of the box (inside)
                 with tape.
              2) Tie a piece of string to the trip-bar of the mouse trap
              3) Place a wad of C-4 where the chese would normally go and
                 be sure that the spring loaded bar will hit it
              4) Set the trap
              5) CAREFULLY tape the other end of the string to the inside
                 of the lid so that it is taught when only half open
              6) Close the box
              7) Leave the box somewhere where the intended victim will find
                 it, when he does...he will open it and BOOM!

                               Exploding Pen
_____________________________________________________________________________


         This device is hardly a weapon but it is a mild explosive and will
    serve as a good prank or practical joke. If you wanted to increase the
    power of the explosive, it would not be hard to hard to turn it into a
    destructive device with a few alterations to the construction.


    Materials:
    ----------

              1) A ball point "click" pen
              2) Gun powder
              3) 8-10 wooden match heads
              4) 1 wooden match
              5) A piece of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")


    Procedure:
    ----------

              1) Unscrew pen and remove all parts except for the button at
                 the top of the pen
              2) Stick the match inside the pen where the ink fill was
              3) Roll the sand paper around the match with the rough side
                 facing in so it touches the match head
              4) Put the remaining match heads in, be sure they are inside
                 the sand paper
              5) Put a wax stopper in the other end of the pen where the ball
                 point came out
              6) Fill the front part of the pen with gunpowder and make sure
                 that the wax prevents it from spilling out

    The finished pen should look like this:

       Wax stopper          Gun powder              Matches & Snadpaper
            \                    |                           |
             \                   |                           |

    Applications:
    -------------

              Basically, antwhere there is writing to be done, there is a
         target for this device. Think of exams!! Heh, I don't think many
         people will be asking to borrow a pen from now on.

                               The Cat Bomb
_____________________________________________________________________________


    This phyle is for amusement only. We suggest that you do not try this
    out at home. Thanks to Mark Blitz for this idea.

         It has come to my attention that a real panic can be generated by
    a cat-bomb in a supermarket or department store.

    A cat-bomb is a simple and inexpensive thing to make.


    Materials:
    ----------
    1 cat - large
    1 sparkler or 1 ft. of waterproof fuse
    1 acetylene/oxygen torch
    1 book of matches

    Procedure:
    ----------
    Squeeze all air and shit out of cat, being careful not to kill same.
    Insert torch nozzle into cat's ass.
    Turn on a 50/50 mixture of the gasses, inflating the cat to approximately
    1/3 larger than normal.
    Insert either sparkler or fuse into cat's ass being careful to minimize
    gas release (some recommend stapling the orifice shut after insertion
    of fuse) very messy!

    Deployment:
    -----------
    Place cat in a place of demonstration, and light fuse with matches.
    Retire quickly to a safe place, (entraails will be a-flying soon)

    Cautions:
    ---------
    Recent experiments with larger animals have shown a 10 minute railroad
    flare to be of substantially greater sealing capacity than the fuse or
    sparkler method. Greater gas retention and thus a greater explosion are
    possible in this manner.

     Part Two:     Chemical Explosives
     ---------     -------------------

                             Astrolite Mixtures
_____________________________________________________________________________


    Astrolite:
    ----------

              Astrolite is a liquid explosive which was a product of rocket
         propellant research in the 60's. Astrolite A-1-5 is said to be the
         world's most powerful non-nuclear explosive. It is approximately 2
         times more powerful than TNT and is safer to handle.


    Astrolite G
    -----------

         Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to pro-
         duce very high detonation velocity, 8600 mps (meters/sec.) compared
         with 7,700 mps for nitroglycerine and 6,900 mps for TNT............
         In addition, a very unusual characteristic is that the liquid expl-
         osive has the ability  to be absorbed easily into the ground while
         remaining detonatable.... In field tests, Astrolite G has remained
         detonatable in the ground for 4 days,  even after being exposed to
         rain.


    Procedure:
    ----------

         Mix 2 parts (by weight) of ammonium nitrate with 1 part anhydrous
         hydrazine. The 2:1 ratio is not exactly perfect but if you screw
         around with the mixture, you will find a better formula.

         Hydrazine is quite hard to get ahold of. t is used in; Rocket fuel,
         agricultural chemicals (maleic hydrazide), drugs (antibacterial &
         antihypertension), polymerization catalyst, solder fluxes, photo-
         graphic development & diving equipment. Hydrazine is a chemical
         that you should be careful with.


    Astrolite A/A-1-5
    -----------------

         Mix 20% (weight) aluminium powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then
         mix with the hydrazine. The aluminium powder should be 100 mesh or
         finer. Astrolite A has a detonation velocity of 7,800 mps.
