    HOW TO HAVE PHUN WITH SOMEONE ELSES CAR. IF YOU REALLY DETEST
    SOMEONE, AND I MEAN DETEST.....(HATE) HERES A FEW TIPS ON WHAT
    TO DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME....
MOVE THE WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES, AND INSERT AND GLUE TACKS.
     THE TACKS MAKE LOVELY DESIGNS......

    IF YOUR "FRIEND" GOES TO SCHOOL WITH YOU. JUST BEFORE HE COMES
     OUT TO LEAVE SCHOOL. LIGHT A LIGHTER ALL THE WAY. THEN PUT IT
    DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH HIS CAR DOOR HANDLE. WAIT......LEAVE....
     ...LISTEN....WHEN YOU HEAR A LOUD " S H I T ! ! !" YOU KNOW
     HE MADE IT TO HIS CAR IN TIME......

    REMOVE THE MUFFLER AND POUR APROX. 1 CUP OF GAS IN IT.....
MUFFLER BACK, THEN WAIT TILL THEIR CAR STARTS.....
    THEN YOU HAVE A CIGARETTE LIGHTER....1 30 FOOT CIGARETTE LIGHTER.....

    THIS ONE IS SIMPLE EFFECTIVE, ANY FOOL CAN DO IT.......
    REMOVE THE TOP AIR FILTER.
    THATS IT!!!!! OR A OLDE BUT GOODIE, SUGAR IN THE GAS TANK.

    STUFF RAGS SOAKED IN GAS UP THE EXHAUST PIPE....
     THEN YOU WONDER WHY YOUR "FRIEND" HAS TROUBLE WITH HIS/HER LUNGS...

   HERES ONE THAT TAKES TIME AND *MANY* FRIENDS.....
 HIS/HER CAR THEN BREAK INTO THEIR HOUSE AND REASSEMBLE
    IT, IN THEIR LIVING OR BEDROOM.
    PHUN EH?

    IF YOUR INTO ENGINES, SAY EENI MINE MOE AND POINT TO SOMETHING
    AND REMOVE IT.....
    THEY WONDER WHY SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK...

    THERE ARE SO MANY OTHERS, BUT THE REAL GOOD JUICY ONES COME
     BY THINKING HARD..........


AVE PHUN, I AM SURE YOU WILL....
