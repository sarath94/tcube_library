WELL, HERE IS A LIST OF MATERIALS...

-------
1 CAN - DUPONT IMR-4227 GUNPOWDER. (OR
        ANY SIMILAR FACIMILLE).

5 MODEL ROCKET IGNITERS

10 FT - 12 GUAGE WIRE.

ELECTRICAL TAPE
-------

REMEMBER... EXERCISE -EXTREME- CARE
WHEN HANDLING THESE MATERIALS!!!
MAKE SURE NO ELECTRIC CURRENT OR
HEAT SOURCES ARQrI9 STAY IN A DARK
COOL DRY ROOM, FOR MOST SAFETY.

FIRST, POP THE CAP OF THE POWDER.
TAPE THE WIRES OF EACH SIDE OF THE

IGNITERS TOGETHER. THAT IS - TAPE ALL
THE LEFT-HAND WIRES TOGETHER AND ALL
THE RIGHT-HAND WIRES TOGETHER. MAKE
SURE THE IGNITER HEADS ARE NOT
COVERED AND THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE ROOM
FOR TAPEING THE WIRES ON THE LEADS.

CUT THE 12 GUAGE WIRE IN HALF AND
STRIP THE ENDS. CONNECT THE END OF ONE
WIRE TO ONE OF THE SETS OF LEADS ON
THE IGNITERS. CONNECT THE OTHER WIRE
TO THE OTHER SIDE. FEED THE IGNITERS
INTO THE CAN. MAKE SURE THEY REST ABOUT
3 MM OVER THE POWDER. NOW; CLOSE THE
TOP AS BEST AS POSSIBLE AND TAPE IF
NECESSARY. YOUR BOMB IS NOW READY!

PLACE THE BOMB ANYWHERE ON THE CAR
(OR ANYWHERE ELSE WHERE A 12-VOLT
POWER SUPPLY IS AVAILABE) THAT IS CLOSE
ENOUGH TO THE ENGINE. THERE ARE TWO
POSSIBLE WAYS TO WIRE THE BOMB.
EITHER WIRE IT TO THE IGNITION - MORE
DEPENDABLE, OR PLACE ONE WIRE IN THE
SPARK PLUG CAPS AND THE OTHER ON THE
FRAME OF THE CAR, OR ANY OTHER
GROUNDED PLACE ON THE CAR. THE LATTER
MAY NOT WORK WELL SINCE THE IGNITERS
ARE NOT MADE TO HANDLE SUCH VOLTAGE.
IT SHOULD WORK ANYWAY. USE THIS METHOD

IF YOU CANT FIND SOME IGNITION WIRES.
IF YOU CAN GET IN THE CAR, CONNECT IT
TO A CAR APPLIANCE THAT IS ONLY
"HOT" WHEN THE CAR IS ON.
