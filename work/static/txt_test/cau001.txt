   Title: Explosives - Car Bombs

This text file's purpose is to teach someone how to set up a bomb so that it
will go off after someone has started it, or a set period of time after they
have started it.  For the first version, I will only include 2 different
ways.  As more come to me, I will update this file.

Method #1:
    This method requires an explosive.  It does not matter what kind, as long
    as the explosive can be set off by electrical charges.  The basic idea
    is that it sets off the explosive, right?  So you hook your bomb up to
    an electrical part of the car, so that the use of that part sends voltage
    to your bomb.
    Some simple examples are:

    1. Hook up one end of your electrical fuse (model rocket igniter, etc.)
       to the positive end of the coil (it's in the engine compartment if
       you are totally ignorant), and the other end to the car frame (the
       ground).  When the person starts the car, it will explode.
    2. Hook one end to the speaker outputs on the back of the persons car
       radio (It would be better to hook it up to the amp, so that when the
       person "cranks up da bass", the car goes BOOM!!).  Do not hook the
       igniter up to the radio leads (the wires coming from the battery or
       fusebox) because they might be carrying power...and you will go BOOM!
    3. The possiblities are endless.  Think up your own, but make sure the
       wires are not carrying power before you hook up the igniter, because
       you will DIE.  One piece of advice: do not hook up the igniter to the
       battery, because it always is carrying a load.

Method #2:

    This requires no explosives, except for the gas the target has in his car.
    Take a flashbulb, and saw the top off.  The gas will escape but that is
    not important.  Just make sure the filament is NOT broken.  Now solder a
    pos and neg lead to the bulb.  You slide the bulb into the target's gas
    tank and connect the two leads to an electrical device.  We will use the
    brake lights as an example.  You take the plastic covers off the brake
    lights and splice the two leads into the brake light wires.  When the
    target steps on the brake pedal, the car will explode.
