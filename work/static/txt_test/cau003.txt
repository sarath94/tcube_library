Mercury Fulminate

    Mercury Fulminate is the main ingredient in most blasting caps.
    It makes an excellent initiating explosive for many bombs.

Procedure
---------

    1. Get a hold of 5 grams of pure mercury and mix it with about 30-35
       grams of nitric acid.
    2. Gently heat the mixture in a water bath.  When (if you're doing it
       right) the water starts to boil and turn green, it means that the
       mercury has dissolved.
    3. The compound should be then slowly poured in a flask of
       ethyl alcohol.  Be careful because it will emit dangerous red fumes.
    4. After 30 minutes or so the fumes will turn white which means the
       process is almost complete.
    5. Add distilled water to the mixture.
    6. Filter the mixture and you will get small white Crystals.
       This is mercury fulminate and should be washed about 4-5 times.


Smokeless Powder

    Fairly safe and dependable

Procedure
---------
    1. Boil cotton in a 3% solution of sodium hydroxide for approximately
       35 minutes.
    2. Wash the cotton in water and let it dry.
    3. Slowly and carefully make the acid solution.  Mix 20 cc of water,
       250 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 150 cc of concentrated nitric
       acid at 25 degrees C.
    4. Place the cotton in the acid mixture and stir well with a glass rod
       for 35 minutes.
    5. When the acid solution is washed away, boil the cotton again 5 times
       for 25 minutes each.
    6. Use litmus paper to test the acidity of the cotton.  If it is still
       acidic, use a 3% mixture of sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the
       remaining acid.
