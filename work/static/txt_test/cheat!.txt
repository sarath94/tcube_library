2.0 Let's Cheat!!!

    Let's face it. The tests one takes during school and college aren't      
the only tests you'll be taking. So, pencils in hand, and study carefully, 
this will be your entire grade.

3.0 The Eye Test

    Most eye-doctors use an eye test called the Snellen Eye Test.
This is all you need to know.

3.1 Identifying the test.

    The Easiest way to Identify if your Doctor is using this test is
- The starting letter is E
- There are two bars- one green, one red
- There are 11 rows

3.2

    Qualifying for 20/20 Vision means you must make it to line 8, DEFPOTEC,  
above the red bar- although some eye-doctors will have you read line 9,
LEFODPCT, to qualify.

3.3 Secrets of the Eye Test

3.31

    A secret about the eye test is that it only has ---9 letters---.
E-F-P-T-O-Z-L

3.32 The bottom line is pezolcftd

4.0 Lie Detector- How to Beat it

    Ther are two types: Th relevant-control, and the lie control.

4.1 Relevant-Control Test

    This tests will ask of different "felonies" in an upgoing degree. Such 
as:

1. Have you ever kept the bathroom light on?
2. Have you forgotton to flush the toilet?
3. Have you taken home office supplies for personal use?
4. Did you murder Bob Hasajob?
The purpose of this test is that no one will lie about anything. Question 
one is to target your reglar Sweat,Heart-Rate,Voice-level reading. Answers 
that produce hightened responces usually indicate that the subject is 
lying.


4.2 The lie control.

First, look at an average lie-control test:

1. IS YOUR NAME Sarah Hasnolife?
2. Is Paris the capital of France?
3. Have you ever failed to report more than $50 of gambling on last year's 
tax return?
4. Is the sun bright?
5. Do you know why these cash reciepts are $22 thousand in error?
6. Is their something important that you did not mention in your 
application?
7. Are you EBEZZLING?

Here are explanstions to each question:
1: Irrelevant; subjects get nervous on the firt question.
2: Irrelevant
3: Target Rate question
4: Irellevant
5: The important question; relevant
6: Target Rate question
7: The Important Questio #2; relevant

4.3 Ways to beat a polygraph test

    The lie Control test is 75-85 percent accurate, the relevant? 60-75
percent. This is a 10-25% more accurate than flipping acoin

4.21

    You've just read this- thus you already have reduced the chances a good 
%5.

4.22 Exaggeration

    When you find a control question, exaggerate your responces 
(UH...WELL... UH.... The sun is BRIGHT?) This will produce higher reactions 
than the relevant questions and the tester will have to aquit the subject.
Hold your breath, or flex your muscles (if you have them).

4.23 The ol' thumbtack. 

    In the control questions step on the tack previously placed in your 
shoe. This will have the same effect as 4.22
