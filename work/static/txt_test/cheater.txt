1) Play the game to see how many men you get.
2) After game has started get into monitor (need old F8 most of the time)
3) Type 00.FF and search zero page for the # of men at the start of the game
4) Write all the places you find a '5' or '3' or how many you start with.
5) Play it again but this time die once and get into monitor.
6) Check the locations you wrotee down to see if they have decreased by one.
7) If you did successfully find a location that looks good test it a couple
   of times by dieing more then once etc...
8) Get Watson/Inspector into the Ramcard.
9) Use search feature to search memory for things that decrease that location
   you found.
10) If Watson finds something, then you're in luck! Usually that's the cheat
    and all you have to do is NOP ($EA) it out.
