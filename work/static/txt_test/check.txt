     If you haven't guessed already this file is designed to
tell you how to circumvent one of the more frequently used
library and anti-shoplifting systems in use today. The system
is called Check Point(tm) and I assume it is manufactured by
the company with the same name. It is used widely by
libraries and a few retail chains, as well as many
independent stores.

Brief Overview of System Operation:

     Realizing of course that I did not call the company to
ask about this system and how to defeat it. I took it upon
myself to draw several conclusions on how the system works.

1) The system consists of a series of poles about 4-5 feet
   high at all exit points.

2) The sensors are stuck inside the object to be protected.
   The sensors are about 2 inches by 2 inches square and can
   be disguised as something they are not.

   Example: In a retail store they are disguised as a UPC
   symbol, or price tag.

   Example: In libraries they can be marked as "Reference
   Only Not to be taken from premises" Or something similar.
   Sometimes they are printed with the words "Date Due" and
   can actually be stamped on.

   Close visual inspection of the sticker will reveal several
   factors.

   a) They might say "Checkpoint(tm)" on them.
   b) They look as if they have a spiral circuit tracing on
      themselves. This circuit is layered between the paper,
      and therefore can only be noticed when held in front
      of a light.

      It should be noted here that the stickers, ARE in fact
      an actual radio frequency circuit!!

      What has been determined is that the spiral circuit you
      see is actually and inductive coil. The paper separates
      the coil to form a capacitor. Together with the coil
      and capacitor you get an a circuit that oscillates at
      a specific frequency when energy is applied to it!!

3) The poles located next to the exits emit an
   electromagnetic field.

4) When the sensor sticker is brought near the poles
   something very ingenious happens. The sticker starts to
   oscillate at a particular frequency determined by the coil
   size and capacitance in the sticker.

5) It has been determined that the frequency emitted by the
   stickers is 8.250 MHz.

6) When the poles detect this frequency an alarm sounds.

     That's it! Really pretty simple system to understand.
But it gets even easier to defeat it!

There are two main ways to defeat the system.

1) Get rid of the sticker all together.

   This is not too practical in the case of a library book as
   you may damage the pages it is adhered to.

2) Change the resonant frequency of the circuit so the poles
   cannot detect it.

   Approach two is more my style. As my way requires no
   damage to be done to the actual book or what-have-you.

   When you purchase something they have to make sure that
   you can get it out of the store without setting off the
   alarm and getting harassed by there security.

   What they do is put a sticker on the Checkpoint(tm)
   sticker that says something like "Paid Thank You" or
   similar. If you look at the sticker closely you'll notice
   that it is actually metal!

   In brief, when metal is brought near an inductive coil it
   changes it's inductance. There are two ways of changing
   frequency in an RF circuit. One is to change the
   capacitance. Two is to change inductance.

   What you want to do is change the inductance. So get
   a piece of tin foil and tape it right up against the
   sticker! The metal (Tin foil, or any other metal) WILL
   CHANGE THE INDUCTANCE OF THE COIL, THEREBY CHANGING IT'S
   FREQUENCY SO THE POLES CANNOT DETECT IT!!!  The metal piece
   does not have to be big, but make it at least 1 inch square
   just to be safe. Make sure it is flush against the sticker!

   That's all there is to it!

     Yes, it really is that simple, tin foil will do it every
time. But as a side line here some of you may like this idea.
I have yet to try this yet, but it sounds great in theory.
Make a circuit that broadcasts on 8.250 MHz. Now go to your
library or store. When you see someone walking out, like
someone you don't like, or some old bitch lady who cut you
off in line. You can turn on your transmitter, this in turn
(should) activate the alarm. You see the poles just detected
8.250 MHz from your transmitter. That person will be stopped,
now when they get done with being harassed by the librarian,
do it again and again. They will feel real dumb because
everyone will stare at them. Needless to say you can just as
easily remove one of the tags and hide it on your victim.

    Sorry I made it so easy, but what did you expect?

I'd also like to thank The Carrier Culprit for his immense input into
this file.

               ****** ADDENDUM TO ABOVE ******

Additional information conflicting with the above has just been
discovered about the CheckPoint(tm) system. The stickers used in
the system may not actually transmit any frequency at all. The stickers
are in fact resonant to the frequency of 8.250 MHz. But it has been
determined that it could be the poles that emit the frequency, and in
fact the stickers absorb the energy emitted. When the poles detect this
drop in power, they go into alarm. Again the above information may be
correct, but this theory outlined here seems more likely to be true.
If the information contained in this addendum is in fact true the idea
of a radio transmitter used to activate the system will not work.
This text file had already been released when this information was
discovered. That is why I added an addendum to the above instead of
re-typing the whole thing. If you have the old version of the file,
please erase it and replace with this version.

                    ****** NOTE ******

It should be noted that the method of attaching metal to the sticker
will still bypass the system. The above addendum does not effect
the information contained in the main file in anyway.

Again the reader is cautioned that use of the information contained
herein is illegal. As such, the reader assumes all responsibility for
their actions.
