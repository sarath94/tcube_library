 This article deals with the instructions for creating some
dangerous explosives. If you intend to make any of these explosives, do so in
small amounts only, as they are all dangerous and could seriously injure or
kill you if done in larger amounts. If you don't know anything about
chemistry, don't do these experiments!  I am not joking in giving this warning.
Unless you have a death wish, you shouldn't try any of the following
unless you have had prior experience with chemicals.

I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this info
it is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who are
interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.


I. Common "Weak" Explosives.

     A. Gunpowder

     75% Potassium Nitrate
     15% Charcoal
     10% Sulfur

      The chemicals should be ground into a fine powder (seperately!) with a
morter & pestle. If gunpowder is ignited in the open, it burns fiercely,
but if in a closed space it builds up pressure from the released gases and
can explode the container. Gunpowder works like this: The potassium nitrate
oxidizes the charcoal and sulfur, which then burn fiercely. Carbon Dioxide and
sulfur dioxide are the gases released.

     B. Ammonal

      Ammonal is a mixture of ammonium nitrate (a strong oxidizer) with
aluminum powder (the 'fuel' in this case). I am not sure of the %
composition for ammonal, so you may want to experiment a little using small
amounts.

     C. Chemically ignited explosives

  1. A mixture of 1 part potassium chlorate to 3 parts table sugar
(sucrose) burns fiercely and brightly (similar to the burning of magnesium)
when 1 drop of concentrated sulfuric acid is placed on it. What occurs is
this: when the acid is added it reacts with the potassium chlorate to form
chlorine dioxide, which explodes on formation, burning the sugar as well.

  2. Using various chemicals, I have developed a mixture that works very
well for imitating volcanic eruptions. I have given it the name 'MPG
Volcanite' (TM).
  Here it is: Potassium Chlorate + Potassium perchlorate + Ammonium
Nitrate + Ammonium Dichrmoate + Potassium Nitrate + Sugar + Sulfur +
Iron filings + Charcoal + Zinc Dust + Some coloring agent. (Scarlet=
Strontium Nitrate, Purple= Iodine crystals, Yellow= Sodium chloride,
Crimson= Calcium Chloride, etc...).

  3. So, do you think water puts out fires? In this one, it starts it.
Mixture :
 Ammonium Nitrate + Ammonium Chloride + Iodine + Zinc Dust. When a drop or two
of water is added, the ammonium nitrate forms nitric acid which reacts with the
zinc to produce hydrogen and heat. The heat vaporizes the iodine (giving off
purple smoke) and the ammonium chloride (becomes purple when mixed with iodine
vapor). It also may ignite the hydrogen and begin burning.

     Ammonium Nitrate: 8 grams
     Ammonium Choride: 1 gram
     Zinc dust: 8 grams
     Iodine crystals: 1 gram

  4. Potassium Permanganate + glycerine when mixed produces a purple-colored
flame in 30 secs-1 min. Works best if the potassium permanagnate is finely
ground.

  5. Calcium Carbide + Water releases Acetylene Gas (Highly flammable gas used
in blow torches...)

II. Thermite Reaction

  The Thermite Reaction is used in welding, because it generates molten
iron and temperatures of 3500 C (6000F+). It uses one of the previous
reactions that I talked about to start it!

  Starter=Potassium Chlorate + Sugar

  Main Pt.= Iron (III) Oxide + Aluminum Powder (325 mesh or finer)

    Put the potassium chlorate + Sugar around and on top of the main pt. To
start the reaction, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid on top of
the starter mixture. Step Back! The ratios are: 3 parts Iron(III) Oxide to
1 part aluminum powder to 1 part potassium chlorate to 1 part sugar.
When you first do it, try 3G:1G:1G:1G! Also, there is an alternative starter
for the thermite reaction. The alternative is potassium permanangate+glycerine
amounts: 55G Iron(III) Oxide, 15G aluminum powder, 25G potassium permanganate,
6ml glycerine.

III. Nitrogen-Containing High Explosives

  A. Mercury(II) Fulminate

    To produce mercury(II) fulminate, a very sensitive shock explosive, one
might assume that it could be formed by adding fulminic acid to mercury. This
is somewhat difficult since fulminic acid is very unstable and cannot be
purchased. I did some research and figured out a way to make it without
fulminic acid.

You add 2 parts nitric acid to 2 parts alcohol to 1 part mercury. This is
theoretical (I have not yet tried it) so please, if you try this, do it in
very small amounts and tell me the results.

  B. Nitrogen Triiodide
    Nitrogen Triiodide is a very powerful and very shock sensitive explosive.
Never store it and be careful when you're around it-sound, air movements, and
other tiny things could set it off.

 Materials-
   2-3G Iodine
   15ml concentrated Ammonia
   8 sheets filter paper
   50ml beaker
   Feather mounted on a two meter pole
   Ear plugs
   Tape
   Spatula
   Stirring Rod

  Add 2-3g iodine to 15ml ammonia in the 50ml beaker. Stir, let stand for 5
minutes.
Do the following within 5 minutes! Reatin the solid, decant the liquid
(pour off the liquid but keep the brown solid...). Scape the brown reisdue of
nitrogen triiodide onto a stack of four sheets of filter paper. Divide solid
into four parts, putting each on a seperate sheet of dry filter paper.
Tape in position, leave to dry undisturbed for at least 30 minutes
(preferably longer). To detonate, touch with feather. (Wear ear plugs
when detonating or cover ears - it is very loud!)

  C. Cellulose Nitrate (Guncotton)

       Commonly knwon as smokeless powder, nitrocellulose is exactly that-
it does not give off smoke when it burns.

   Materials-
     70ml concentrated Sulfuric Acid
     30ml Concentrated Nitric Acid
     5g Absorbent Cotton
     250ml 1m Sodium Bicarbonate
     250ml beaker
     Ice Bath
     Tongs
     Paper Towels

   PLACE 250ML BEAKER IN THE ICE BATH, ADD 70ML SULFURIC ACID, 30 ML NITRIC
ACID. DIVIDE COTTON INTO .7G PIECES. WITH TONGS, IMMERSE EACH PIECE IN THE
ACID SOLUTION FOR 1 MINUTE. NEXT, RINSE EACH PIECE IN 3 SUCCESSIVE BATHS OF
500ML WATER. USE FRESH WATER FOR EACH PIECE. THEN IMMERSE IN 250ML 1M SODIUM
BICARBONATE.
 IF IT BUBBLES, RINSE IN WATER ONCE MORE UNTIL NO BUBBLING OCCURS. SQUEEZE
DRY AND SPREAD ON PAPER TOWELS TO DRY OVERNIGHT.

  D. Nitroglycerine

    Nitroglycerine is a *very* dangerous shock sensitive explosive. It
is used in making dynamite, among other things.  I am not sure as to the
proportions and amounts of chemicals to be used, so I shall use estimates.

    Materials-
      70ml conc. Sulfuric Acid
      30ml conc. Nitric Acid
      10 ml Glycerine
      Ice Bath
      150ml beaker

   Put the 150ml beaker in the ice bath and make sure that it is very cold.
Slowly add the 70ml sulfuric and 30ml nitric acids to the beaker, trying to
maintain a low temperature. When the temperature starts to level off, add
about 10ml glycerine. If it turns brown or looks funny, *RUN LIKE HELL*. When
Nitroglycerine turns brown, that means it's ready to explode... if it stays
clear and all works well, keep the temperature as low as you can and let
it sit for a few hours. You then should have some nitroglycerine, probably
mixed with nitric and sulfuric acids.

WHEN YOU SET IT OFF, YOU MUST NOT BE NEARBY. NITROGLYCERINE CAN FILL 10,000
TIMES ITS ORIGINAL AREA WITH EXPANDING GASES. THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU HAVE
10ML'S OF NITROGLYCERINE IN THERE, IT WILL PRODUCE SOME 100,000ML'S OF GASES.
TO MAKE IT INTO DYNAMITE, THE NITROGLYCERINE MUST BE ABSORBED INTO
SOMETHING LIKE WOOD PULP OR DIAMAECEOUS EARTH (SPELLED SOMETHING LIKE THAT).

IV. Other Stuff

  A. Peroxyacetone
   Peroxyacetone is extremely flammable and has been reported to be shock
sensitive.

    Materials-
      4ml Acetone
      4ml 30% Hydrogen Peroxide
      4 drops concentrated Hydrochloric Acid
      150mm Test tube

 Add 4ml acetone and 4ml hydrogen peroxide to the test tube. Then add 4
drops concentrated hydrochloric acid.  In 10-20 minutes a white solid should
begin to appear. If no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water
bath at 40 celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours. Swirl the
slurry and filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two
hours. To ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while
staying at least a meter away).

  B. Smoke smoke smoke...
   The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke. Since
this reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary
for larger amounts of smoke.

   6G Zinc powder
   1G Sulfur powder

    Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back. A lot of smoke should
be created.
