Cheating a dollar bill changer.
 
 
   Have you ever seen one of those really big changer machines in airports,
laundrymats or arcades that dispense change when you put in your 1 or 5 dollar
bill?  Well then, here is an article for you.
 
 1)  Find the type of change machine that you slide in your bill lYkQ!:%M1
     not the type where you put the bill in a tray and then slide the tray in!!
 2)  After finding the right machine, get a $1 or $5 bill.  Start crumpling it
     up into a ball.  Then smooth out the bill, now it should have a very
     wrinkled surface.
"!bill on the left side
     about 1/2 inch below the little 1 dollar symbol (See Figure).
 4)  If you have done all of this right then take the bill and go out the
     machine.  Put the bill in the machine and wait.  What should happen is:
     When you put your bill in the malhine it thinks everything is fine.  When
     it gets to the part of the bill with the notch cut out, the machine will
     it and (if you have done it right) give you the change at the same time!!!
     You end up gettingJ{UIbill back, plus the change!!  It might take a
     little practice, but once you get the hang of it, you can get a lot of
     money.

 Getting money from a payphone requires only a few simple things.
 
1. Intellegence-You have to know when to do this kind of thing. If you do it in
     broad daylight, with a bunch of people
     watching you, you'll have the TELCO on
     you so fast you won't know what happened
 
2. You must select a phone that you can have access to its wires.
     (Look for a plastic shroud running down the wall, or the junction box
     outside!) On a normal phoneline, only two wires are used:Ring & Tip.
     (Red & Green). The payphone uses the red and green for its telephone
     operations, but it also uses the yellow & black to control the  coin
     mech. relays & solenoids.Find a section of the wire where a cut will
     not be easily seen. Strip off the insulation of the cord, exposing the
     four wires. Now, get out the all purpose wire cutters (Or finger nail
     clippers if you like) and cut the black & yellow wires.  Now just sit
     back and let people use the phone!
 
What Happens? Well, when you put money into a payphone, it stays in the coin
    mechanism until 1 of 2 things happen.
  1. You connect your call, talk, and Hangup. After you hangup, your money
         goes to the collection box. (The only way to get the money then is
         to rip the box out!)
 
  2. You call a number that doesn't answer, or get busy signal, or something
         like that, and then hangup. When you hangup, the money goes from
         the coin mech. to the coin return.
 
 
 
 That is the key! After the Black & Yellow wires have been cut,
 the money goes neither to the coin box or coin return! It just sits there!
 All you have to do is come back at like 3:00 in the morning, re-connect the
 black & Yellow wires,  pick up the handset & put it back down.
 
                       **********JACKPOT**********
 
 All the money that was put in that phone that day comes shooting
 out the coin return.   (Just like in the movies!) It is the
 AWESOMEIST FEELING! I have collected upto $30 a day doing this to
 phones all   around tow n!
 
Dangers: The people that put money in and don't get connected or get a busy
signal and hang up do NOT get their money back. Usually they will call the
operator who inturn calls the Repair Dept. (That is why it is important to cut
the wire w here it can not be seen. But if you want to do this as a one time
thing.........GO FOR IT! Oh yes, alternate phones every other couplple of days
or so. Stay on your toes and watch out for white Vans!!!!) If someone sees you
taking money out of the coin return (Getting $15 in change out of a phone is
not common!) Just say you hung up the phone and all this mony started pouring
out! (It doesn't hurt to give them a little of it either!) After a month or
two the Phone Co. catches on, so I do not reccomend using one phone
for over two weeks.
GOOD LUCK!! Oh, bye the way.........I forgot to mention this file is
for information only (SNICKER SNICKER)...........Good Luck!!!!!!
