I didn't type this in.  This belongs to the Data Blitz.  He's asl eep right now
so I can't use his password.  But this is funny so I run it for you....
==================================
Do you know how many incredibly STUPID people there are in this world?	Too
many to be exact.  But not more than the number of good liars, or better known
as '' Social Engineers ''.  I say this due to a mega-phun saturday afternoon I
just had recently.  (By the way, try this if you ar e bored, or don't have any
money some day!!  Is it a kick!!) Well, my saturday's phun started by walking
into my neighborhoo d computer store and getting the incredibly DUMB-LARD-ASS
to actually beli eve me.  I told him that my partner, The Slipped Disk, and I
were planni ng on purchasing another computer for our ''software business''.
We said that we wanted an IBM-compatible, that was portable, but not a Compa q.
Well, did that drive this particular guy crazy!  He was so hard-press ed for a
sale, he gave us about 10 books of literature, and a 30 minute sales pitch.
While I was talking with this obviously screwed up guy, The Sli pped Disk was
fucking aroung with the computers typing in timed programs to tell the man and
his assistant that they had been taken for fools.  Then for the grande finale,
the man's assistant unplugged the computer that he was presently demonstrating
to us.	So I casually looked at my watc h and told the man that ''we had
another appointment'', and we left.  It may not sound funny to you, but if me,
you or anyone else co uld have seen that guy's face when he realized it was a
put-on, it would probably kill you!!  NOTE:  If you plan to do something like
this, do not plan it.  The extreme amount of spontaninity that went into this
is required!!

       Have Phun!!!  The DATA BLITZ & The Slipped Disk
