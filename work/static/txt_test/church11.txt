11 Ways to disrupt a Religious Service

by Aron Kay
   
   All organized religion is a waste of time, diverting people
from fighting against the U.S. junta.
   The churches, part of the corporate state, are among the 
institutions that deserve to be trashed and desecrated for
setting themselves up as sort of religious McDonald's stands.
Instead of fast food service, one gets fast Biblical brainwashing
(as in the Moonies) which has poisoned millions upon millions.
So it's time to get it together to disrupt the sickness that
turns people into Jesus junkies.

1.  Walk into St. Patrick's Cathedral as a couple wearing clerical
    robes, remove them and do a streak during mass.
2.  Enter the church with a joint in your hand and tell the preacher
    that it's not sinful to smoke grass because the Bible says,
    "Let there be grass!"
3.  Drink liquor or smoke cigarettes at a Mormon church.
4.  Pie the preacher while he is giving his boring sermon.
5.  Plant marijuana in the church yard.
6.  Pull a false alarm during a church service, thereby disrupting
    the service.
7.  Buy an add in the local smut paper advertising the church's 
    phone number as being that of a whorehouse.
8.  Enter a synagogue with a pig on a leash.
9.  Enter a church disguished as the devil.
10. Disrupt the service and announce that you are Jesus Christ.
11. Hand the preacher a hypodermic needle and a bag of white powder
    telling him that "Religion is the opiate of the masses."
