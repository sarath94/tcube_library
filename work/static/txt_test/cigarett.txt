OH Man, I need a cig......
 
Well, I don't smoke, but I can save you HUNDREDS of dollars!
 
 
Many Cigerette machines are of the type I'm going to describe, they have 3 rows
of button on the front, and in the back, it's perfectly flat, except for the win
dow, ah yes, the window.....
 
 
T +------------------+                     The window is either glass or
h !                  ! <- SLOPED OUTWARD   plastic, and is there for the
e +------------------+                     service guy so he knows when
  !                  !                     he needs to restock something.
B !                  !
a !                  !                     It may be painted over to look
c !                  !                     like metal.
k !                  !
  !                  !                     Start by shattering the glass
  !  ==============  ! <- *THE WINDOW*     on the right side, use a screw-
  !                  !                     driver, and break it in about 5
  +------------------+                     inches to the left.  Then remove
  !                  ! <- SLOPED INWARD    the broken glass.  You should be
  +------------------+                     able to see a row or two of Cigs
    H              H                       Vertically in the chutes, your
                                           1/2 way to your nicotine fix.
 
Start the second part by pullining the window to the right so you have some spac
e on both sides of the glass.  Now carefully crack this in half vertically with
a good hard hit.  Now spread the two pieces apart, so you have 3 spaces, and 2 c
hunks of glass left.  Lifting on both sides of one of the pieces of glass, lift
up, and now pull out, then down.  You should see a good selection!  Do the same
to the other piece of glass.  Now, with a little technique, your going to need a
 knife of something about 6 to 8 inches long (Do not use your dick).  A pencile
should work.  Find your brand and push it forward quickly, almost punching it fo
rward.  Retreve your booty in the front of the machine.  You can rip them out ba
ckwards, but that usally screws up the whole pack.
 
For Profit: How to completely empty the machine
 
There are other chutes besides the ones you see.  Empty out a whole row.  Now lo
ok in there, you'll see more about 18 inches back!  For these, you need about 3
feet of good wire.  Normal house 120 volt line works, it must be stiff.  On some
