      INDEX:      I.BASIC'S
                 II.FORGERY
                III.SCAMS
                 IV.Where 2 Find Me
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I. Basic's of passing a bad check

   The bad check passer normally follows certain guides when working. He knows
that there are certain things that the merchant insist, and he tries to 
blend in with the crowd.
   The first step is reconnaissance. The professional bad check passer seeks
to find the easy targets. To do this you opps I mean he will enter various
stores to observe there procedures. He may make small purchaces with cash or
check, so he can see for himself whether cashiers ask for id when a person
pays buy check, and also what sort of id passes in a certian store.
   The secret of a con man's success is not his uncanny skill of fooling
people, nor is it his being a masterful psychologist. Instead, it's his
willingness to lay back and observe before working his con, because he
knows that it's easy to fool careless or vulnerable people. When there are
several cashiers, a few minutes spent in watching for the tired or careless
one who skips basic security procedures avoids the need for devising ways to
fool an alert one.
   Another important factor is timing. The bad check passer needs the 
anonymity of a crowd, and knows that long check-out lines keep cashiers 
under pressure. This works in his favor. The height of the bad check season
just passed, it's late fall, just before Christmas, when stores are crowded
with people buying gifts.
   The first point is to appear respectable, as part of the clientele. The
bad check passer does not enter a store dressed in rags, or demonstrate a
surly or vicioius manner. He does his best to appear respectable and very
pleasent, because he is first of all a salesman, and knows that he must sell
himself if he's to succeed in "selling" a bogus check to a clerk. 
   Another point is that the bad check passer must always keep his cool. Any-
one who looks nervous, or gets flustered easily, will attract attention and
arouse suspicion.

  II. Forgery

   It's possible to counterfiet checks from scratch as how I outlined in pt.1
most people will say that it requires a high-tech operation cause of the
special paper and shit but if you invest about $600 in equipment and services
you will be able to gross $100,000. I have herd from people that some have 
tried to use Check Fraud pt.1 with no success, if that's the case I suggest
that you let me see a 'sample' of your product case you may be overlooking
something simple that can get you locked up!
   It's also necessary to know certain numbering systems, even for low-tech
forgeries. Social Security cards, are not accepted for I.D., but the 
government issues them following a number system according to state of origin
Likewise, checks have clearing house and bank numbers, according to 
geographical are, and creating an effective forgery requires printing the
correct numbers on the checks.
   Just like carders & hackers have "Dumpster Divers" so do the check fraud
artist. The system works the same instead of going through garbage from
the phone co. or stores the check forger goes through garbage from printing
plants that print checks for local banks and shit.
   
    Photocopy machines are very useful for check copying, because of color
toners. These often come close to matching the inks used on genuine checks.

   Another forgery technique that if your reading this file I'm sure you'll
try is the use of "print shop" programs on home  computers, coupled with
laser jet printers that print high-resolution copies.  Available software
allows producing almost any type font needed, and for those not included in
available software, a scanner allows picking it up from a copy.


 III.  CHECK SCAMS

 1) The Double Check Scam

 An almost fool-proof scheme to defraud retailers is the double check. The
check passer (which we will refer as 'paperhanger' from now on) buys an
expensive item at a jewelry store, for example and writes a completely 
legitimate check for the price. The clerk telephones the bank to verify
that there is enough on deposit to cover the amount. The bank assures him
that the check will be covered, and the clerk begins to wrap the purchase.
At this point the 'paperhanger' changes his mind, and selects a slighty less
expensive item. He asks for his checkback, and takes out his check book to 
write another one, for the smaller amount. The clerk, having already verified
the first check, usually finds it unnecessary to verify a smaller check, not
noticing that the second check is drawn on another account at the same bank.
The second account is closed, and the check bounces, by which time you, opps
I mean the paperhanger is long gone.

 If you live in a state which makes it a felony to draw checks on closed 
accounts (like where I live). Open the second account, but with the minimal
balance like $25. This covers the legal contingency, and avoids making it
obvious that the intent was fraud.


 2) Telephone Order Scam

 Some telemarketers and other shop-by-phone companies accept customers' 
checks. Some use special telephone check authorization services. One procedure
is to ask the customer for the bank routing number, which is printed in
magnetic ink at the lower left side of the check. The next step is to request
account number, to the right of the routing number. The weakness in this
procedure is that anyone finding a discarded check made out by a person, can
use the numbers without having to sign the account holders name or show the
check for verifaction. 


 2) Kiting Checks

 "Kiting" means covering checks with other checks drawn on accounts with 
insufficient funds, and using the freshly drawn checks to cover the ones used
tocover them. Kiting depends upon the 'float' or time lag, between the moment
a check is written and the day it arrives at the other bank for collection.
Such a scam could go on forever, with one check covering the other in 
rotrtion.They'd all be good, but only if the series lasted forever. The 
reason kiting is illegal is that the last check would bounce.
 In its simplest form, kiting work this way: The Fraud artist draws a check
for oone thousand dollars from checking account "a" and deposits it in 
account "b" set up under another name. Knowing the time it takes for the 
check to clear, he writes a check for $1500 on account "b" and deposits it
with $500 "cash back" into account "a". He uses the $500 for living expenses.
Alternately, he can write a check for $1000 to cover the first check, and
write another to cover his living expenses.
 
 The next cycle begins with his having to write a check on account "a" for
$1500 to cover those drawn on account "b" He deposits this in "b" and draws
other  checks to pay for purchases, as well as to cover the $1500 check
draen on "a".
 
 Modern kiting operations are more sophisted than the one I just mentioned.
A modern con artist will set up several checking accounts in the names of
dummy companies, to avoid the obvious tip-off of a customer writing checks
to himself on other accounts.

 Kiting can work only under certain conditions:

 * There has to be enough time between deposit and collection. Modern
   electronic banking has reduced the "float" time to only a day or two
   with three days maximum between banks at opposite ends of the country.
   The practical difficulty of running checks back and forth between the
   Alantic and Pacific coasts makes this very awkward.

 * All banks involved have to be willing to allow the account holder credit
   for uncollected funds. This means that the bank must not put a "hold"
   until collection on checks deposited. Otherwise, the checks the con man
   uses to cover those drawn on each account would bounce, and the scam will
   become totally unglued.

 * The con man knows when to quit! Eventually, someone will become suspicious
   of an account that has constantly increasing deposits and withdrawls.
   When that happens the police will be waiting at the bank.



 3) Sweeting the Account

 This means using an established account and depositing bogus checks to
increase the balance, meanwhile drawing other checks on it. Another way to
take advantage of a "sweetened" account is to take "cash back" on bogus 
checks. Banks will often give long-term customers credit for uncollected
funds, and sweetening the account with out-of-state checks will often allow
playing fast and loose with the checkbook until the bogus checks begin to
bounce.



 4) The High Tech Hood Scam

 The name of this should tell you who pulled it off and that it's a 
'goldmine'.  NOw to work this scam you'll open up a account in a bank under
a fake name. With that  handy you'll deposit checks that are 'sort-of'
stolen. Your saying huh? Let me explain...
 When you find a personal check in the street the person usually puts a
stop payment on it now what you do is calculated about6-10 checks after
that, say the found check number is 160 you print up a check #170 using 
all the info contain here and in part 1. and deposit the check into your
account make sure you don't write something that might bounces. Keep it
small like $475.00 under $500 so if you get bagged you who be charged with
'Grand Theft". If you redo all the #'s right the check will clear!


 I also wrote a guide on check fraud the insiders guide but it's in G-file
mode on THE NEW YORK HACK EXCHANGE BBS so you can look for it there under
the G-file section of scams.
