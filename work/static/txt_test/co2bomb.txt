CO2 Cartridge Bomb

Ingredients:

   * 1 CO2 cartridge (per bomb)

   * 1 hacksaw

   * 1 phillips screwdriver

   * 1 bowl

   * enough gunpowder to fill the CO2 cartridge. Just get one pound, then
     you can do this a whole lot. Get extra fine, it works best

   * 1 very small funnel. I have found that one of those things that
     doctors use to look in your ear works the best.

   * 3-5 inches of wick, per bomb. Make sure it is model-rocket type
     (green) or make your own with duct tape and gunpowder (explained
     later)

This is how you make it:

   * Use the hacksaw to cut the top off the CO2 cartridge, there is a line
     near the top, use this as a guide.

   * If there are any burrs, or anything like that, clean out the hole with
     the screwdriver.

   * Pour some gunpowder into the bowl, and scoop some with the funnel,
     keeping your thumb over the hole.

   * Once situated over the CO2 cartridge, remover your thumb and fill the
     CO2 cartridge. I suggest you do it over something, so if you spill you
     can still use the powder for later.

   * Compact the powder in as tight as you can, this will make a louder,
     and more powerfull explosion.

   * Once it is full, put the wick in, so that it is in the powder, (so you
     know it will light) seal this with some duct tape. Now you are ready
     to use it.

     WARNING: Do not stand near the bomb when it goes off. The shrapnel is
     produces is rather formidable

Places to use CO2 bomb:

   * Coin return of a pay phone

   * put between sign and signpost (blows them off usually)

   * tape to a big window

   * muffler of a car (you don't need a wick for this, push it in as far as
     you can, and heat will do the rest)

   * open the gas tank and put it in there

   * put in elevator, the press a button (don't get in with it)

   * electical boxes or phone boxes

How to make wick out of duct tape and gunpowder:

* take some duct tape, about 5 inches or so, and lie sticky side up on
table.

* put a small amount of gunpowder down the middle, leaving about 1 inch of
tape free of gunpowder.

* then fold it up.

* after you put the CO2 cartridge at the end with the gunpowder, make sure
that the gunpowder in the wick and that of the CO2 cartridge touch.

*=gunpowder

* Light the part that has no gunpowder and make sure it is burning really
well, before you run like hell.

* Burn time varies with how much empty duct tape there is, but once the
powder is lit, you have less that a second to get away.
