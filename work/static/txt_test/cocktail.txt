
HOW TO MAKE A COCKTAIL BOMB

Cocktail bombs were very popular by the Resistance Forces of World War II.
They were used against the Nazis by the resistence forces, and are very
easy to make.

1)  You must first get a good sized bottle, about 1 ft high or so. A wine
    bottle will do nicely. Fill the bottle with any kind of combustible
    substance such as liquor, gas, oil, etc.

2)  After filling the bottle (about 3/4 of the way), get the cork that the 
    bottle was fitted with and make a hole in it about the size of the
    diameter of a fuse. You can make the hole smooth and even if you have a
    drill, or if that is not available, a long, thick needle will do.

3)  Put the cork in the neck of the bottle and make sure it is on tight. Now
    stick the fuse through the hole of the cork and extend it into the bottle
    untill it is about a2-3 immersed in the combustible material. Make sure
    the fuse is extended on the outside of the bottle also so that you have
    enough time to throw it.

4)  Now your Cocktail Bomb is complete.

THROWING TIPS

After completion of the bomb above, you must light the fuse and throw it.
There are a few things you should make sure you follow.

1)  Wait until the lit part of the fuse is close enough to the flammable
    stuff before throwing. This will take practice, but you should be able
    to master it easily.

2)  Don't throw the bomb too early, otherwise it will hit the ground and the
    bottle will break, therefore letting out the gas or whatever, and it
    will not explode.

3)  Don't wait too long for throwing it, otherwise you will be in loss of a
    few body parts and maybe some other things (like your life).
