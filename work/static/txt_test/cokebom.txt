MATERIALS: CALCIUM CARBIDE, A TIN COKE CAN, RUBBER CEMENT, WATER, MEDIUM SIZED 
TEST TUBE THAT WILL FIT COMFORTABLY WITHIN THE TIN CAN, A CORK WIDER THAN THE 
MOUTHPIECE OF THE TIN CAN AND A KNIFE

LOCATION OF CONSTUCTION: OUTDOORS

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: DON'T LET ANY HUMIDITY OF WATER CONTACT THE CALCIUM 
CARBIDE
 

THIS WEEK WE'LL START WITH AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE CARBIDE BOMB


WELL A CARBIDE BOMB CONSISTS OF A BASIC CHEMICALL REACTION BETWEEN CALCIUM 
CARBIDE AND H2O. WELL FIRST GO TO ANY HARDWARE STORE AND BUY CALCIUM CARVIDE. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE IT BECAUSE CARBIDE CAMPING LAMPS USE THE STUFF. THE STUFF 
SHOULD LOOK LIKE SMALL PIECES OF GRAVEL. NOW YOU GO AND FIND SOME KIND TIN CAN 
AS IN A USED COKECAN... WELL DRINK THE COKE (BURP).... NOW PUT IN THE CALCIUM 
CARBIDE SO IT FILLS ABOUT 1/4 OF THE CAN... NOW GET A TEST TUBE. FILL THE TEST 
TUBE (MEDIUM SIZE) FULL OF WATER. NOW PLACE THE TUBE INSIDE THE CAN THROUGH 
THE MOUTHPIECE. NOW YOU ARE FACED WITH AN OPEN MOUTH PIECE.. WELL MOST PEOPLE 
CAN'T FIND A PROPHANE TORCH TO MELT A PIECE OF METAL ON THE OPENING... SOO... 
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS TAKE A CORK LARGER THAN THE OPENING OF THE MOUTHPIECE. NOW 
TAKE A KNIFE AND ETCH IN A RING ABOUT 1/4 - 1/2 INCHES ABOVE THE SMALL END OF 
THE CORK. NOW CARFULLY WEDGE IN THE CORK (IT MAY TAKE A WHILE) INTO THE 
MOUTHPIECE. AFTER IT SLIPS INTO THE WEDGE IN RING. LET IT SIT FOR A DAY SO IT 
SOMEWHAT RETRNS TO A BLOATED CORK.. OR TAKE A FEW( I EMPHASIZE FEW) DROPS OF 
WATER AND PLACE TEM ON HE CORK.. IF ANY WATER GETS IN YOU WILL HAVE GREAT 
DIFFICULTY SEEING, WRITINMG, WALKING... THINGS LIKE THAT. NOW TAKE RUBBER 
CEMENT AND PLACE IT AROUND THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE CORK AND THE TIN CAN. LET 
THE GRENADE SETTLE TILL THE GLUE DRIES. NOW YOUR READY TO GO... GET YOUR 
LITTLE SISTER OR ANYONE YOU HATE AND SAY COME HERE LETS PLAY CATCH.. WELL 
THROUGH THE CAN MAKE SURE IT HITS THE GROUND NEXT TO THE TARGET  VERY HARD.. 
SO THE TEST TUBE BREAKS.. NOW HOT GASES FORM ... PRESSURE BUILDS AND ( OHH 
NOO!)
                          BOOM!
