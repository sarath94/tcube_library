MATERIALS: 
 
Bottle (experiment with smaller bottles first) 
Aluminum Foil 
Muratic Acid (Pool Acid) 
 
 
	Don't know what to do with those 2 liter plastic Coke 
bottles? Hey, don't throw them away! It's gonna fill our dump 
sites. Leave the dumpsite room for other stuff. Besides, it will
make Greenpeace happy. If anyone wants to create a very easy and
loud explosion, take a two liter plastic Coke bottle, fill it 
with muratic acid (pool acid), tear up strips of aluminum foil. 
Now do the rest quickly for the reaction will happen, add the 
strips to the bottle, cap it, shake the bottle, put it in an open
area, GET UNDER COVER, and watch. The bottle will expand and blow
up with a great cloud of smoke. Don't breath the vapors of the 
acid bottle when you open it or those of the smoke. 
	Experiment first with smaller amounts and bottles until yoiu
find this one works when you get the right amount of foil to acid
to bottle size right, which is tricky because the acid of the 
next bottle is always of a different strength. Start out by using
smaller plastic bottles until you get the ratio of acid-to-foil 
and the reaction time to a point that you can follow because it 
is very unstable. TAKE EXTRA CARE! What I would do is throw the 
bottle, holding the "cap side" as it hurls, at the same time, 
mixing the stuff. 
 
 
 
	REMEMBER, EXPERIMENT WITH SMALLER PLASTIC BOTTLES UNTIL YOU
GET THE RATIO OF ACID-TO-FOIL AND THE REACTION TIME TO A POINT 
THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW. THIS STUFF IS VERY UNSTABLE. 
 
Have fun!
