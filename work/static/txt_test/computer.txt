  Computer stores are always fun to play little jokes on.  As we all know the
emp loyees there are supierior to us and know alot more in the field of
computers.  (well that's what we are supposed to think, but they are mostly
rejects that couldn't get jobs at K-mart.)

 Here are sum of the fun things i like to do to do there:

  1) Go to the nearest Apple, (make sure no one's looking), and quickly take
     off the lid.  Look for the speaker and follow the cord to where it says
     "speaker" and pull it out.

     Now go to one of the 'experts' and ask them to show you a game.  Tell him
     you heard it had great sound effects.  Now when he boots it up there
     should be no sound at all!  He should turn a deep red.

  2) If there are any Apple ]['s or ][+'s dash over to them and write this pro-
     gram.  //e's are fine, but they can press open-apple=ctrl-reset and boot
     up the computer.  but type this nifty program in:

   10 POKE 214,255:POKE 1010,102: POKE 1011,213: POKE 1012,112
   20 HOME: ?"PRESS ANY KEY TO PLAY:"
   30 ?:?" (this can be any name you want, but a current arcade game is the
      best name to use)
   40 POKE -16384,128: GET A$
   50 FOR I=1 TO 10:?CHR$(7);:NEXT: INVERSE: ?"DELETING ALL COSTUMER
      RECORDS & ACCOUNTS"
   60 GOTO 60

  Let me explain the program, the pokes you entered in the beginning have it so
if you press reset, it'll go to the beginning line #.  So the program will keep
running until sumone reboots the whole system.

  This is fun to watch when an employee can't get out of this fun program when
trying to show sumone how to use the computer.

  3) Go up to a guy at the counter with all the games behind it and ask:  "Do
     you have any pirated games that i could get free?" This is fun too, cuz
     the guy gives you a strange look and a lecture on how pirates ruin thier
     business, but who carez?

  4) Go up to a MacIntosh and pick up the mouse.  Now turn it over and you'll
     see a rubber circle that holds in the little ball that rotates.  Screw the
     rubber thing so it comes off, now hide the rubber ball you got, and hide
     it behind a computer.  Then go up to a computer guy and ask if he'll show
     you the mouse.  To his suprise the Mouse won't work.  I wonder why?

  5) If they have a few Apples all together in a cluster, go behind them and
     pull out the cords of 1 monitor and switch them with another, so all the
     monitors go to different computers, this is fun to see what sumone does
     when they type sumthing and it goes on the screen next to them.  Although
     this is better to do in school typing class!

  This is only sum of the fun you can have in computer stores, but you can
always think up sumthing better, but try those out.  More fun than Auto-
dialing your favorite BBS!
