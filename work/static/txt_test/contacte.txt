PETROLEUM JELLY AND POTASSIUM CHLORATE
IN A 1 TO 1 RATIO BY WEIGHT MAKES A
TOTALY SAFE WHEN WET COMPOUND BUT IS
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE
WHEN DRY.
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
3 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE
5 GRAMS OF IODINE IN A BEAKER WITH 50ML
OF WATER MIXED ALL TOGETHER. ADD 20ML
OF AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE (AMMONIA WATER
10%) FILTER AND THE RESULTING SOLID IS
CALLED NITROGEN TRIIODIDE. WHEN WET IS
VERY SAFE BUT UPON DRYING BECOMES VERY
EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE, TO THE
POINT OF A FEATHER SETTING IT OFF.
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
TO SET OFF THE ABOVE EXPLOSIVES ALL YOU
REALLY NEED TO DO IS PUT SOME OF THE
MIXTURE ON OR IN SOMETHING AND THEN DROP
IT SORT OF LIKE AN INPACT BOMB. IT
EXPLODES ON INPACT WITH ANOTHER OBJECTS
