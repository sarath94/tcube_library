1. Foreword

nor the publisher assumes any responsibility for the use or misuse of
information in this book.

"During the Cuban Revolutionary War half of the comrades who were assigned
the task of producing homemade explosives and devices were either killed or
seriously injured."
                      Ernesto Che Guevara

        This manual is intended to demonstrate the ease with which
improvised explosive devices can be made from materials commonly used by
industry.
        I have included fifty common chemicals which will react explosively
in contact with sulfuric acid and/or nitric acid. I have selected these
specific chemicals because (1) sulfuric acid and nitric acid are the most
common acids in America; (2) they are comparatively safe to handle; (3) the
simplicity in designing an explosive device in which one component is acid.
        This manual is not a chemistry book and does not dwell in depth on
the health risks or chemical reaction hazards which accompany these
chemicals. Most of them will react violently with many other chemicals than
those I describe.
        These chemicals are all potentially dangerous or they would not
have a place in this work. With proper care and safety precautions these
chemicals can be used, and are used daily, in normal industrial settings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Safety

        In all dangerous situation it is always wise to take all possible
precautions. Here are the ten most important safety tips:

1.  Never store chemicals for extended periods.
2.  Never store chemical combinations for any length of time.
3.  Work in a cool, well ventilated area.
4.  Keep sources of heat and electricity well away from the work area.
5.  Keep the number of people in the work area to an absolute minimum.
6.  Keep materials far apart.
7.  Use a respirator while working.
8.  Use safety goggles.
9.  Wear as much protective rubber clothing as possible.
10. Have appropriate fire fighting equipment and large volumes of
    water close at hand.

Hazards: Highly toxic, extremely corrosive to body tissue; will cause
         immediate and severe burns; inhalation of vapor will cause loss of
         consciousness and severely damaged lung tissue; mists will damage
         skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Keep cool and dry.
First aid: Inhalation - Move victim to fresh air. Give artificial
           respiration of oxygen if victim has stopped breathing.

5. Devices

Single bottle bomb I:

1. Fill a bottle 90 percent full of acid. Cap securely
2. Fill a small sack (jute or other sturdy material) with industrial
   chemical.
3. Tape the package to the side of the bottle. When the bottle is broken
   the acid will destroy the sack and come into contact with the industrial
   chemical. Detonation will occur. It is not recommended to throw this
   device Molotov cocktail-style. It is best dropped off a roof onto enemy
   troops or vehicles.

Single bottle bomb II:

1. Fill a bottle 90 percent full of acid. Cap securely.
2. Partially cut, thereby weakening it, the glass with a glass cutter.
3. Suspend the bottle with a cord, a minimum of seven feet above a cement
   or tile floor.
4. Pile industrial chemical on the floor, around but not under the bottle.
5. Attach a cigarette and matches assembly to the cord. The cigarette will
   eventually ignite the matches. The cord will burn through and the bottle
   will drop. When the bottle breaks, the acid comes into contact with the
   industrial chemical. Detonation will occur.

Double bottle bomb I

1. Fill a bottle 90 percent full of acid. Cap securely.
2. Fill a second bottle 90 percent full of industrial chemical. Cap
   securely.
3. Join the two bottles with heavy tape.
4. Place a small explosive charge between, and in contact with both
   bottles.
5. Detonate the explosive charge in any convenient manner. However, be sure
   to use an explosive charge that will break both bottles, but not scatter
   the contents. One number eight blasting cap will usually suffice.
   The charge will break both bottles. The acid and the industrial chemical
   will come into contact. Detonation will occur.

Double bottle bomb II

1. Fill a bottle 90 percent full of acid. Cap securely.
2. Fill a second bottle 90 percent full of industrial chemical. Cap
   securely.
3. Join the two bottles with heavy tape.
4. Partially cut the glass of each bottle with a glass cutter.
5. Suspend the bottles with cord, a minimum of seven feet above a cement or
   tile floor.
6. Attach a cigarette and matches assembly to the cord. The cigarette will
   eventually ignite ignite the matches. The cord will burn through and the
   bottles will drop. When the bottles break, the acid comes into contact
   with the industrial chemical. Detonation will occur.

Jerry Can Bomb

1. Create a large dent in the top of a metal jerry can.
2. Check carefully that in forming the dent, the jerry can is not ruptured.
3. Fill jerry can with industrial chemical.
4. Pour acid directly into the dent. The acid will burn through the metal
   and come into contact with the industrial chemical. Detonation will occur.

[ Transcriber's notes: The SERI part in the Ethyl Alcohol article is to me
  unexplainable, I wonder why someone would like to order ten gallons of
  gasohol? %*) Also: If you want to succeed in making a nice acid bomb,
  both your acid and your "industrial chemical" must be as concentrated and
  free from other substances as possible. Otherwise, your device could
  either not work at all, or become a very sensitive thing, blowing off
  your right arm at no cause, so be careful, for my sake, please... ]
