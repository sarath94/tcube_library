                          Delay Detonator 
                          --------------- 
 
     This phile shows how to build a simple electronic delay detonator for 
almost any type of bomb that uses fire to detonate.  This detonator can also 
be modified to activate blasting caps for detonating Plastique etc.  All of 
the parts are easily available at Radio Shack or other electronic stores. One 
drawback of this detonator is that it costs about $10 in parts to make one. But if you 
are rich or if you need more of a delay than a fuse can provide, this'll do 
the trick.

     24 gauge solid core insulated wire 
     Soldering tools 
     Solar Igniters (electric matches available at hobby stores)

             *** NOTE: Any SPDT 6 volt, 500 ohm, 12 mA relay can be used 
                       instead of #275-004.  Especially because #275-004 
                       takes up a lot of room on the board. 
 
             *** NOTE: Many of the parts are sold in sets and you will 
                       only need one.  So, if you build more than one 
                       detonator, you won't have to buy more of some 
                       parts.

     The alligator clips should be attached to the breadboard using short 
     pieces of wire. 
 
     The longer lead on the LED is the positive lead. Make sure you hook it 
     up with the right polarity.  Same rule goes for the capacitor. 
 
     The pins on the 555 IC are numbered from the top (side with paint & notch). 
     On the left side the read DOWN as 1,2,3,4. On the right side the read DOWN 
     8,7,6,5. 
 
TEST 
     Attach the two batteries and clip roach clips together, the LED will light. 
     Press and hold the switch for 3 seconds.  You should hear a click then the 
     LED will go out.  In a little while (depending on what capacitor and resis- 
     tor size you use), you should hear another click and the LED will turn on 
     again.  If this doesn't happen, you phucked up! Check your circuit care- 
     fully. 
 
USING DETONATOR 
 
     **** Read these instructions carefully before attempting this **** 
 
     If the TEST worked, the timer is ready to use.  Attach two fresh batteries 
     and connect the two roach clips.  Allow time equivalent to your delay for 
     the capactitor to charge.  Now, press the switch until the LED goes out. 
     Now, quickly but carefully attach the roach clips to the Solar Igniter that 
     has been previously attached to your bomb.  Then, get the phuck out of 
     there!!!  Once the time delay expires, the relay will open completing the 
     second circuit and igniting the Solar Igniter. 
 
 
Tech Note: The values of R1 and C1 determine the time delay.  The greater these 
           values, the longer the delay.  The equation to determine time delay 
           is as follows: 
                               C1 (in farads) x R1 (in ohms) 
        Time (in seconds) = --------------------------------- 
                                             6 
           The value of C1 is in farads.  Most capacitors are listed in micro- 
           farads.  To use the formula, divide the number of microfarads by 
           1,000,000. 
 
           Example: If you use a 500 microfarad capacitor for C1 and a 10 
                    megaohm resistor for R1, you would have a delay of 14 
                    minutes (833 seconds).
