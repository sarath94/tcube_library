*  A Time delayed tire deflator.  *
***********************************


        Sure, anybody can deflate a tire pretty easily, by cutting off
the valve stem with a set of wire cutters, by slashing or puncturing the
relatively weak sidewalls, and many other ways.  But most of the time,
the driver immediately recognizes his problem, and takes the appropriate
action. No real harm done, except to his pocket and/or time.

        What is needed is a method to deflate the tire AFTER he has
started driving on it.

How about  this one:  prop a 1.5 inch screw, nail, or other pointed
object against the tire such that upon driving, the object punctures
the tire.   The problem with this is that one of two things will
probably happen. Either the object will seal the hole it makes, thus
preventing any appreciable deflation ( How many time have you inspected
a car tire and been surprised to see a nail or screw deeply imbedded into
it, without there being any apparent air leakage?  I have had this happen
to me at least 5 times.  Hint: Dont remove the screw/nail until you
have remove the tire to get it fixed. Once the nail is out, so goes the air.)
Or, the deflation occurs so fast that the driver notices almost
immmediately, and he is able to avoid serious damage/injury.

Well, here is the solution:

        Get a 1.5 inch screw/nail that is fairly stubby (1/4 inch diameter
will do).  Now carefully drill a 1/16 to 1/8 inch hole down the center
of it.  This is easily done in a drill press.  If you don't have access to
a drill press, then use a vise and an ordinary hand held drill. Practice
drilling the hole manually on a lot of screws until you get it right.

It should look something like this:

                      _________
                      \   X   /

                        | X |        X  -  hole through screw
                        | X |        X
                        | X |
                        | X |
                        | X |
                        | X |
                        | X |
                        | X |
                         \X/

        Prop the screw/nail up against the tire such that it will
puncture the tread of the tire when the victim drives off.  Preferrably,
it should be the right rear tire, so that any hissing noise will not be
easily heard by the driver.

        What should happen is the following:  upon being puncture, the
tire will immediately begin losing air at a rate determined by the size
of the hole drilled in the screw/nail and the inflation pressure of the
tire.  The smaller the hole, the slower the deflation rate.

        The beauty of this is that the driver will probably not notice
that his tire is becoming flat, because that determination is easier
to make at low speeds, such as when pulling out of a parking spot.
As the tire gets lower, the sidewalls will begin rubbing on the pavement,
eventually the tire will be all but destroyed, and the driver will have
to buy a new one.
        If the driver is travelling at high speeds, say on a highway,
the tire could in fact fly apart violently, causing a crash and severe
damage/injury/death.

hazards that might present themselves out in the real world, and
should not be used to inflict harm or damage on anyone.
