             EXPLOSIVE INFO  
             ==============  
  
  WHEN PETROLEUM JELLY AND POTASSIUM  
CHLORATE ARE MIXED IN A ONE TO ONE  
RATIO BY WEIGHT, IT MAKES A TOTALY SAFE  
WET COMPOUND BUT WHEN DRIED IT BECOMES  
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE.  
  
  MIX 3 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE AND 5  
GRAMS OF IODINE IN A BEAKER WITH 50 ML  
OF WATER. THEN ADD 20 ML OF AMMONIUM  
HYDROXIDE [AMMONIA WATER 10%]. FILTER  
THIS SUBSTANCE AND THE RESULTING SOLID  
IS CALLED NITROGEN TRIIODIDE. WHEN THIS  
IS WET IT IS SAFE, BUT WHEN DRY BECOMES  
VERY EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE.  
  
 (TO SET OFF ABOVE EXPLOSIVES, PUT THE  
MIXTURE ON OR IN SOMETHING THE DROP IT  
SORT OF LIKE AN IMPACT BOMB. IT, LIKE  
A HAND GRENADE, WILL EXPLODE ON CONTACT  
WITH ANOTHER OBJECT.)  
  
 FOR GREAT SMOKE BOMBS, MIX 4 PARTS  
SUGAR AND 6 PARTS POTASSIUM NITRATE  
(SALT PETER) AND HEAT IT OVER A LOW  
FLAME UNTIL IT MELTS. STIR WELL, THEN  
POUR IT INTO A CONTAINER YOU DON'T NEED  
.  
BEFORE IT SOLIDIFIES, PUT A FEW MATHES  
ON THE SURFACE AS FUSES. ONE POUND OF  
THIS SUBSTANCE WILL FILL A BLOCK NICELY  
WITH THICK WHITE SMOKE.

NITROGLYCERIN:  
   
*CAREFULLY* MIX EQUAL AMOUNTS OF NITRIC  
ACID AND SULPHURIC ACID TOGETHER IN A   
GRADUATED CYLINDER OR OTHER TALL, THIN  
CONTAINER.  
SLOWLY ADD ORDINARY GLYCERIN AND STIR   
VERY LIGHTLY.  
WAIT A WHILE, AND POUR OFF THE LIQUID   
ON THE TOP. THIS LIQUID IS NITROGLYCERI  
N, AND SHOULD BE HANDELED WITH CAUTION.  
WASHING IT WITH SODIUM CARBONATE WILL  
IMPROVE THE PURITY.

  THERE ARE SEVERAL EYE AND NOSE  
IRRITANTS ON THE MARKET WHICH CANB BE  
EASILY DUPLICATED.  
  
   A GOOD IRRITANT IS FORMALDEHYDE.  
BETTR KNOWN AS EMBALMING FLUID, IT  
SMELLS HORRIBLE, HURTS THE EYES AND  
NOSE, ANDB ON EXPOSURE TO THE AIR IT  
VAPORIZES, MAKING A ROOM UNINHABITABLE  
FOR HOURS.  
  
   IT CAN BE SQUIRTED FROM A WATER  
PISTOL OR NASAL INHALER, POURED ON THE  
FLOOR OR VAPORIZED BY A BOODESCRIBED  
IITHE STINKUM PHILE.  
  
   FORMALDEHYDE CAN BE BOUGHT AT THE  
DRUG STORE UNDER THE PRETEXT OF WANTING  
IT TO PRESERVE MICE OR OTHER LAB  
SPECIMEN.  
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  
  
   THE IRRITANT MAILMEN USE AGAINST  
DOGS AND WHICH IS SOLD WIIFOR SELF  
DDFENSE IS OLEORESID CAPSICUM. CAPSICUM  
IS THE HOT ESSENCE OF RED PEPPERS.  
OLEORESIN IS THE PROCESS FOR EXTRACTING  
IT. TO EXTRACT THE CAPSICUM, GRIND UP  
FOUR OUNCES OF RED PEPPER SEEDS IN A  
BLENDER OR WITH A MORTAR ANDB PESTLE.  
RED PEPPER SEEDS AABOUGHT IN THE  
GGOCERS'S.  
  
   THE DRY, GROUND SEEDS ARE THEN PUT  
INTO A COFFEE PERCOLATOR IN WHICH THERE  
IS AOBUT 16 OUNCES OF ALOHOL,PREFERABLY  
WITH THE WATER DISTILLED OUT. THE SEEDS  
ARE THEN PERCOLATED FOR ABOUT A HALF  
HOUR. THE ALCOHOL IS THEN DISTILLEEOFF  
UNIL THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF TABLE  
SPOONS OF RED LIQUID LEFT IN THE FLASK.  
THE RED LIQUID IS THEN ADDED TO A HALF  
PINT OF LIGHT MINERAL OIL, BOUGHT AT A  
DRUG STORE.  
  
  IT CAN BE SPRAYED FROM A NASAL SPRAY  
. ANOTHER GOOD WAY IS WITH A WINDOW  
CLEANINNSPRAYER BOUGHT AT ANY DIME  
SSRE. THE TUBE OF THE SPRAYER IS CUT  
TO FIT IN A TWO OUNCE MIDICINE BOTTLE.  
THIS WAY YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THE GOODY  
TO LAST THROUGH A WHOLE DEMONSTRATION,  
NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU'RE ON. IT IS  
ALSO NICE TO KEEP BY THE DOOR OR BY  
YCOMPUTER TO REPEL INTRUDERS.  
INTRUDERS. (BELL SECURITY!)  
  
   BEFORE USING, THE CONTAINER SHOULD  
BE GIVEN A PHEW SHAKES. UNDER LABORAT  
ORY CONDITIONS ALL THE OIL IS EXTRACTED  
FROM THE SEEDS. BUT WITH MY MICKEY  
MOUSE METHOD A LOT OF OIL IS LEFT IN SO  
THE RESS IS QUITE POTENT. JUST BE  
SSE YOU STRAIN OUT ANY LARGER BITS  
SO THE SPRAYER HOLE IS NOT CLOGGED.  
  
   THE GROUND SEEDS LEFT IN THE  
PERCOLATOR ARE DRIED AND SAVED. THEY  
ARE GREAT FOR THROWING INTO THE FACES  
OF PEOPLE IN A MOB. IF YOU REALLY WANT  
A LAUGH, THH SOME BROADCAST FROM A  
TTEATER BALCONY DURING THE DEATH SCENE  
IN "LOVE STORY".  
  
   THE GOODY CALLED MACE IS PROBABLY  
ONLY ACROLEIN. IF NOT, IT WORKS JUST  
AS WELL AS MACE AND IS SIMPLE AND FUN  
TO PRODUCE. IT IS THE SAME PRODUCT AS  
DESCRIBED ON PAGES 104 THHUGH106 OF  
TTE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK. MINE HOWEVER,  
IS BROKEN DOWN AND SIMPLIFIED.  
  
   ACROLEIN IS NOT TOXIC BUT CAUSES  
HORRIBLE PAIN IN THE NOSE AND COPIOUS  
TEARS, ANDB IRRITATES THE SKIN. A SHOT  
IN THE FACE FROM A WATER PISTOL OR  
SOME OTHER SPRAYER WILL PUTTNYONEOUT  
OO THE GAME FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR.  
  
   ACROLEIN IS BEST MADE ANB OUNCE AT  
A TIME. PUT IN THE FLASK 21/2 OUNCES  
OF GLYCERINE AND 3/4 OUNCE OF SODIUM  
BISULFATE (SANI-FLUSH), BOTH OF WHICH  
CAN BE BOUGHT AT ANY GROCERY STORE.  
  
   THE STILL IS SETTP WITH THE OUTSIDE  
TTE CONNECTED AS THE FUMES ARE BAD.  
WHEN THE MIXTURE STARTS TO BUBBLE IT  
MUST BE WATCHED CONSTANTLY TO MAKE SURE  
IT DOES NOT BUBBLE UP INTO THE NECK OF  
THE FLASK. IF IT STARTS FOR THE NECK  
OF THE FLASK, REMOVE THE LAMP UNTIL IT  
SETTLES N. IF THE LAMP IS TOO HOT,  
THE TIN CAN IS RAISED ON SMALL BLOCKS  
UNTIL THE RIGHT HEAT IS GOTTEN.  
  
   DISTILL OFF AN OUNCE OF ACROLEIN  
AND TAKE AWAY THE LAMP. AN OUNCE IS  
ALL THIS SIZE BATCH IS GOOD FOR. LET  
THE FLASK COOL FOR ANB HOUR BEFORE  
OPENING AND CLLG. POUR THE RESIDUE  
DDWNTHE SINK AND PUT YOUR FACE OVER  
THE DRAIN TO GET A SAMPLEOF THE  
VAPOR. THEN CAP THE RECEIVING BOTTLE  
AND WASH EVERYTHING THE ACROLEIN WAS  
IN CONTACT WITH. THE BEST SQUIRTER  
FOR THE THREE IRRITANTS ABOVE IS A  
WATER PISTOL. MOST WATEEISTOL. MOST  
WWTERPISTOLS LEAK BADLY SO THEY MUST  
BE TRANBSPORTED BARREL UP SO THE GOODY  
WON'T

                   (> MAKING YOUR OWN N  
APALM <)  
  
REMEMBER THOSE DAYS BACK IN VIETNAM WHE  
N NAPALM WAS USED TO BURN THE JUNGLE  
AWAY AND CONSEQUENTLY CRISPED A FEW PEO  
PLE WITH IT?  WELL, HERE'S HOW TO MAKE  
YOUR VERY OWN NAPALM....  
  
TAKE AN EVER DAY DETERGENT AND MIX IT W  
ITH GASOLINE.  LETS SAY LUX.  
MIX TWO PARTS LUX WITH ONE PART GASOLIN  
E. AND LET SIT FOR A FEW DAYS.  
I ALWAYS KEEP ADDING GASOLINE SLOWLY FO  
R SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL ALL OF THE  
GASOLINE IS ABSORBED INTO THE DETERGENT  
. WHAT NAPALM IS, IS A VERY HOT FIRE.  
IT WILL SPREAD VERY QUICKLY AND WILL ST  
INK TO HIGH HEAVEN. IF YOU ARE AROUND  
THE FIRE YOU WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME GET  
TING THE SMELL OFF YOU. WHEN IGNIGHTING  
THE STUFF YOU MUST USE A MATCH OR SOME   
OTHER KIND OF FLAME.  
  
ALTERNATE METHOD  
  
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE NAPALM SHOULD   
GET A COPY OF "THE POOR MAN'S JAMES  
BOND" AN EXELENT BOOK.  NAPALM CAN BE M  
ADE BY FILLING A BATHTUB WITH **HOT**  
WATER, FILLING A LARGE MEATAL CONTAINER  
 WITH GASOLINE, AND THE LETTING THE  
GAS GET HOT ENOUGH TO DESOLVE **SOAP**   
(NOT DETERGENT!) THE SODIUM IONS IN DET  
E  
RGENT JUST ARENT THERE ANYMORE THANKS T  
O  
 ENVIROMENTALIST--WHAT YOU  
WANT IS AN R-...-NEG.; NA+ COMPOUND!) U  
NTILL IT GETS LIKE JELLY.  PUT IT IN  
PLASTIC (NO POLYEURITHANE UNLESS YOU WA  
NT THEM DISOLVED) BAGS AND USE WATTER  
PROOF CANNON FUSE.    WHAMMO! ...CRACKL  
E ...BURN!  
  
ANOTHER METHOD  
  
LOTS OF DISCUSSION A WHILE BACK ON NAPA  
LM...I RAN ACROSS 2 FORMULAS ON ANOTHER  
BOARD LAST NIGHT AND THOUGHT I WOULD PO  
ST THE MESSAGES. CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS  
DUE: #1 IS FROM 'CAMBODIA THE RANGER';   
#2 IS FROM 'THE KNIGHTS OF SHADOW'.   
   #1) 1 PART GASOLINE / 1 PART JOY DET  
ERGENT  
       GASLOINE + STYROFOAM (THE STYRO   
WILL DISOLVE...)  
       GAS + PVC (LIKE SOFA CUSHIONS, *  
NOT* PIPE)  
       THE LAST FORMULA IS HIGHLY UNSTA  
BLE - BE CAREFUL  
   #2  I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT MIXING   
SPLICING ADHESIVE (FOUND IN ANY FILM   
       STORE) AND STYROFOAM PEANUTS UNT  
IL NO MORE WILL DISOLVE. THIS FORMULA  
       ALSO MAKES A THICK BLACK NOXIOUS  
 SMOKE THAT IS IDEAL TO COVER YOUR  
       ACTIVITIES AND MAKE ANYONE WHO A  
PPROACHES VERY ILL...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  
  
LETTER BOMBS ARE VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE,  
BUT THE DIFFICULT PART IS MAKING SURE  
IT WILL DETONATE PROPERLY, OR THAT IT  
IS NOT OBVIOUS THAT IT IS A BOMB.  
  
MIXTURES:  
ABOUT 75% ALUMINUM POWDER WITH 25%  
IRON POWER IS BEST.  THIS IS A LIGHT  
VERSION OF THERMITE, SINCE IT IS IN  
AN ENCLOSED SPACE (THE ENVELOPE, AS  
DESCRIBED BELOW A WAYS).  
MIX THE ABOVE WELL.  THE IDEA IS  
THIS:  IRON CAN BURN, AT A VERY HIGH  
TEMPERATURE, BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE  
HELP.  THIS IS WHAT THE ALUMINUM IS  
FOR.  ALUMINUM BURNS AT A RELATIVELY  
LOW TEMPER ATURE, SO IT IS USED AS A   
CATALYST OF SORTS.  MAGNESIUM IS USED  
TO FLASH-IGNITE THE ALUMINUM, WHICH  
THEN BURNS THE IRON, AT  A SUITABLE  
TEMPERATURE.  SINCE THIS IS GOING OFF  
IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE, IT WILL BURN  
MUCH HOTTER AND SLOWER AND WITH MORE  
VIOLENCE THAN A NORMAL MIX.  
I ADVISE YOU PLAY WITH THIS FOR A  
WHILE, LEARNING YOUR MIXTURE.  
  
NOW FOR THE FUN STUFF:  
INSULATED (PADDED) ENVELOPE,  
THE TYPE THAT IS DOUBLE LAYERED.  
SEPERATE THE LAYERS.  IN THE INNER  
LAYER GOES THE WONDERFUL MIXTURE,  
ONE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH.  KEEP  
THIS SECTION SEPERATE, BUT IT MIGHT  
BE HANDLE TO TOP IT OFF WITH SOME  
MAGNESIUM.  THE OUTER LAYER CAN BE  
EITHER MAGNESIUM, FOR A FLASH BOMB,  
OR POSSIBLY A MATERIAL OF YOUR OWN  
CHOICE.    
NOW FOR THE DIFFICULT PART!  
THE FUSE...   WE CAN MAKE A FUSE  
FROM ANOTHER SET OF CHEMICALS:  
IODINE CRYSTALS, AND AMONIUM HYDROXIDE,  
IN LIQUID FORM.  MIX THESE TOGETHER,  
IN ABOUT AND EQUAL AMOUNT, BUT YOU   
MIGHT WANT TO USE A HEAVY AMOUNT OF  
IODINE IF PRESSED FOR TIME.  THESE  
FORM A NEW CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE, ABOUT  
AND INCH LONG.  THESE ARE HIGHLY  
VOLATILE, AND I ADVISE KEEPING THEM  
PROTECTED.  THEY HAVE ABOUT THE IMPACT  
POWER OF AN M-100 FOR A TEASPOON.  
I PUT THESE IN A PROTECTIVE CARD-BOARD  
LINING, AND PUT THEM AT THE TOP OF  
THE ENVELOPE.  RIG THIS SO IT PUTS  
PRESSURE ON THE CRYTALS WHEN THE  
PACKAGE IS OPENED, BUT NOT FROM JUST  
SQUEEZING THE ENVELOPE.  THIS IS  
TRIAND I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT HERE.  
SEAL THIS UP, AND YOU HAVE A WORKING  
LETTER BOMB.    
BY THE WAY, SINCE THE BULK OF LETTER  
BOMBS ARE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE, THEY  
RARELY MAKE IT PAST THE POST OFFICE.  
  
*****  
I FROWN UPON THE USE OF LETTER BOMBS  
AS A MEANS OF GETTING EVEN BECAUSE  
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IT IS GOING TO  
DETONATE AROUND, OR THAT IT WILL  
EVEN BE THEM.  THERE ARE SIMPLER WAYS  
OF GETTING EVEN, SO TAKE ONE OF THEM.  
IT IS ALSO A FEDERAL OFFENCE TO MAKE  
AND SEND ONE.  PROCEDE AT YOUR OWN  
RISK.  EVEN GOD FROWNS ON LETTER BOMBS!  
*****  
HOW TO AVOID LETTER BOMBS:  
SINCE YOU MADE IT THIS FAR INTO THE  
FILE, I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO AVOID  
BEING DETONATED WITH A LETTER BOMB  
YOU MAY HAVE HAD SENT TO YOU.  
1)  NEVER OPEN A LETTER BOMB THE WAY  
    IT WANTS TO BE OPENED!  THIS IS  
    THE WAY OF POSSIBLY AVOIDING THE  
    FUSE.  IF IT IS SET TO DETONATE  
    ON CONTACT WITH AIR, THEN THIS  
    WILL NOT WORK.    
2)  DON'T SQUEEZE, BEND, OR ANYTHING!  
3)  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BOMB, THEN  
    DON'T EVEN TOUCH IT!  THIS IS  
    THE BEST WAY TO AVOID PROBLEMS!

CURTESY OF PHANTOM FALCON AND  
   THE MONASTERY  
  
1) GO TO YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND  
TELL THE GUY THAT IS HELPING YOU  
THAT YOU WANT A PIECE OF STEEL PIPE  
ONE FOOT LONG. AND ALSO THAT YOU WANT  
THE ENDS THREADED AND YOU ALS O WANT  
CAPS TO PUT ON THE END.  
  
2) NOW GET AHOLD OF A BABYFOOD JAR.  
MAKE SURE THAT THE JAR WILL FIT DOWN  
THE PIPE REAL EASY LIKE. FILL THE  
BABYJAR WITH EVERYDAY VINEGAR. MAKE  
SURE THE TOP IS SCREWED ON REAL TIGHT.  
**IF IT IS LOOSE YOU WILL BLOW YOUR  
HAND OFF**  
  
3)NOW CAP ONE END OF YOUR PIPE WITH  
ONE OF THE CAPS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE  
PICKED UP WITH THE PIPE. IF YOU KNOW  
OF SOMEONE WITH A WIELDER, HAVE HIM  
WIELD A BEAD AROUND THE THREADS AFTER  
YOU HAVE IT CAPPED.  
  
4)PUT SOME SMALL SHARP ROCKS DOWN THE  
END OF THE PIPE AND THEN SLIDE THE  
BABYJAR DOWN INSIDE S O THE GLASS END  
IS AGAINST THE LITTLE ROCKS. NOW  
EMPTY A MEDIUM BOX OF ARM AND HAMMER  
BAKING SODA INTO THE PIPE. CAP THE  
OTHER END OF THE PIPE AND IF YOU  
CAN WIELD IT, THEN GO FOR IT.  
**BE FUCKING CAREFUL** YOU MIGHT  
BREAK THE JAR INSIDE AND YOU WON'T  
KNOO  YOU BROKE IT UNTIL YOU   
SEE YOUR HAND FLY OFF!!!  
  
5)NOW, WHEN YOU WANT TO BLOW SOMETHING  
UP, JUST SMACK THE END OF THE PIPE   
THAT SENDS THE JAR INSIDE DOWN AGAINST  
THE SMALL ROCKS. OH YEAH, SMACK IT  
AGAINST SOME CONCREAT. THIS BREAKS  
THE JAR AND THE VINEGAR AND BAKING  
SODA MIX TOGETHER AND BUILDS UP  
PRESSURE. WHEN IT GETS TO THE   
CRITICAL POINT....WHAMMY!!!!  
  
******IMPORTANT******  
  
AFTER YOU HIT THE PIPE AGAINST THE  
GROUND, GET THE HELL RID OF IT!!!  
TOSS IT INTO SOMEONES CAR OR SOMEWHERE.  
SOMETIMES. IT TAKES FIVE MINUTS FOR  
IT TO GO OFF. SOMETIMES TWO.  
BUT IT WILL GO OFF! TRUST ME!  
  
I DID THIS WHEN I WAS LIVING IN  
ARIZONA. MY FREIND THAT TAUGHT ME  
THIS WAS A DEMOLITIONS EXPERT FOR   
THE NAVY.  
  
THE FIRST TIME I DID IT. WE TOSSED  
THE PIPE INTO AN OLD HOUSE AND IT  
BLEW ALL FOUR WALLS OUT!!  
THE SECOND TIME WE DID IT, WE TOSSED  
IT INTO AN OLD CAR. AND IT PHUKING  
BLEW ALL FOUR DOORS OFF AND THE   
ROOF THREE FEET INTO THE AIR!!!!  
  
WHEN WE BLEW UP THE HOUSE, WE WAITED  
FIVE MINUTES AND I THOUGHT THAT IT  
WOULDN'T GO OFF SO I CRAWLED OUT OF  
THE DITCH THAT WE WERE IN. WHAMMY!!  
JUST THEN IT WENT OFF! IT THREW ME  
BACK FIVE FEET BACK INTO THE DITCH!  
  
IF YOU FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS   
REAL CAREFULLY. THEN YOU WON'T GET  
HURT.  
---------------------------------------  
  HELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THIS      
HEARS A GOOD TERRORIST EXPLOSIVE       
THAT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE--MORE  
POWERFUL THAN MOST *BLASTING* POWDERS,  
LOTS OF SMOKE, AND A NICE RED FLAME.  
I GOT A BIG WHIFF OF THE SMOKE AND IT   
GAVE ME A HEADAKE FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS  
(ALONG WITH BRAIN DAMAGE SO I CAN'T   
SPELL)  
--GREAT FOR PARTIES  
 
2 TEASPOONS ZINC POWDER  
1 TEASPOON POTASSIUM CHLORATE  
1 TABLESPOON CHARCOAL DUST  
2 TEASPOONS STRONTIUM NITRATE  
1/3 TEASPOON SULPHUR.  
 
                STINK BOMBS  
BY WEIGHT:  1 PART KCLO3 (POTASSIUM   
CHLORATE)   
            1 PART SUGAR  
            1 PART FORMALDYHYDE.  
THIS GETS KINDA GOOIE, SO PACK IT IN A   
CONTAINER OF WATERPROOF NATURE.  
 
                  RDX  
THE FORMULA FOR RDX (20% BETTER THAN   
TNT) IS:  
MIX FORMALDEHYDE WITH AMMONIA TO MAKE   
HEXAMINE, * THIS IS UNSTABLE *  
MIX WITH TNT (70 HEXAMINE/30 TNT) NOW   
YOU HAVE RDX!, MIX IT WITH SOME  
KINDS OF OIL OR WAX AND YOU HAVE GOOD   
PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE!  
 
          MIXING STUFF  
OK  --  IF YOU HAVE TWO CHEMICALS THAT  
   YOU WANT TO HAVE MIXED TOGETHER TO  
   CAUSE, SAY AN EXPLOSION OR LETHAL  
   GAS,  HERE IS A GOOD WAY.  
 
  1. PUT CHEMICAL A INTO A SMALL GLASS  
     JAR AND SEAL THE LID.  
 
  2. PUT CHEMICAL B INTO A LARGE GLASS  
     JAR AND PUT CHEMICAL A JAR INTO  
     THIS JAR.  SEAL THE LID TIGHTLY.  
 
  3. WHEN READY TO MIX, THROW ONTO A   
     HARD SURFACE SUCH AS A RIOT,  
     CITY BLOCK OR ROAD.  THE TWO   
     MIXTURES MUST BE EASILY ACTIVATED  
     OTHERWISE THIS METHOD IS NOT VERY  
     GOOD.  
 
           THE >MEGA< BOMB  
OK..GO TO YOUR HARDWARE STORE AND BUT  
SOME CALCIUM CARBIDE..MAKE SURE IT  
IS IN THE FORM OF LITTLE ROCKS...THEN  
WHEN THIS IS MIXED WITH WATER IT FORMS  
A GAS. IF THE GAS TOUCHES A SPARK  
OR WHATEVER THEN >KAAAABOOOOM< A   
VERY BIG KABOM TOO....BUT I DONT  
KNOW HOW TO PUT A FUSE ON THAT SUCKER  
AND MIX IT WITH WATER....'CAUTION'  
EXTREME PRESSURE IS BUILT UP WHEN  
THE GAS START....THIS MAY BE ENOUGH  
TO BLOW IT UP WITHOUT THE FLAME...  
 
ABOUT 5 ROCKS AND A LITTLE WATER IN  
A RUBBING ALCHOHOL BOTTLE WITH A HOLE  
ON TOP WERE THE EQUVILENT OF ABOUT  
AN M-80...I HAVENT TRIED A FULL  
ONE YET THOUGH..  
 
A GOOD FUSE IS THE KIND THAT YOU CAN  
GET AT HOBBY STORES. THE ROCKET FUSES.  
THEY ARE THE SAME STUFF THEY USE ON  
M-80'S AND CHERRY BOMBS...AND BURN  
UNDER WATER....  
=======================================  
           MAKING THERMITE  
=======================================  
  
  THERMITE IS A POWERFUL SUBSTANCE  
WHICH CAN BURN THROUGH PRACTICALLY  
ANYTHING, SAVE TUNGSTEN. IT IS   
ESPECIALLY OF USE IN TRYING TO CRACK  
OPEN A FORTRESS FONE.  NOW HERE'S HOW  
YOU MAKE IT. IT IS VERY SIMPLE.  
  THE FIRST STEP IN MAKING THERMITE IS  
TO MAKE HEMATITE. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,  
HEMATITE IS IRON OXIDE (RUST). HERE IS  
A GOOD METHOD OF MAKING LARGE QUANTITIE  
S  
OF RUST.YOU WILL ELECTROLYZE A METAL  
ROD, SUCH AS A COMMON NAIL. YOU WILL  
NEED A SOURCE OF DC POWER AS WELL. AN  
ELECTRIC TRAIN TRANSFORMER IS PERFECT.  
ATTATCH THEROD TO THE POSITIVE WIRE.  
                      ^^^^^^^^  
THEN PLACE THE ROD AND THE NEGATIVE  
WIRE IN OPPOSITE SIDES OF A GLASS JAR  
FILLED WITH WATER. PUT A LITTLE SALT  
IN THE WATER, JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT  
CONDUCT WMLL (A TEASPOON). LET THE  
SETUP SIT OVMRNIGHT. IN THM MORNING,  
THERE WILL BE A DARK RED CRUD IN THE  
JAR. FILTER ALL THE CRUD OUT OF THE  
WATMR OR JUST FISH IT OUT WITH A SPOON.  
NOW YOU WILL NEED TO DRY IT OUT. HEAT  
IT IN AN IRON POT UNTILL IT ALL TURNS  
A NICE LIGHT RED.  
  THE OTHER INGREDIANT YOU WILL NEED  
IS ALUMINUM FILINGS. YOU CAN EITHER  
FILE DOWN A BAR OF ALUMINUM, OR (AS  
I SUGGEST) BUY ALUMINUM FILINGS AT  
YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE SHOP. (IF YOU BUY  
TTR USE NO LESS THAN 94% PURE  
ALUMINUM. IT IS CALLED DURALUMIN.)  
 THAT'S ALMOST IT. NOW, MIX TOGETHER  
THE RUST AND ALUMINUM FILINGS. THE  
RATIO SHOULD BE 8 GRAMS OF RUST PER  
3 GRAMS OF ALUMINUM FILINGS. THAT'S  
THERMITE!  
  NOW, TO LIGHT IT! STICK A LENGTH OF  
MAGNESIUM RIBBON IN A PILE OF THE  
THERMITE. (EITHER STEAL IT FROM CHEM  
LAB OR BUY IT AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE  
STORE. IF NOT, ORDER FROM A CHEMICAL  
SUPPLY HOUSE. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP.)  
THE RIBBON SHOULD STICK INTO THE   
 THERMITE LIKE A FUSE.  NOW YOU LIGHT T  
HE  
MAGNESIUM WITH A BLOWTORCH. (DON'T  
WORRY. THE TORCH ISN'T HOT ENOUGH TO

        SILVER NITRATE  
HMMM... WANT TO MAKE SOMEONE LOOK  
REAL STUPID?  WELL, GO TO YOUR PHARMACY  
AND GET SOME SILVER NITRATE (A CLEAR  
LIQUED THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE WATER).  
HOSPITALS USE IT WITH DROPPERS TO  
PUT IN NEWBORN BABIES EYES TO KILL  
CERTAIN STRAINS OF VIRUSES THAT  
MAY EXIST ON THEIR EYES AFTER THEIR  
TRAVEL DOWN THE BIRTH CANAL.  THESE  
VIRUSES (CAUSED BY VD) WOULD MEAN  
THAT THE KID WILL BE BLIND...  
OK, ANYWAY.. ONCE U HAVE SOME OF  
THE STUFF, JUST POUR A THIN FILM  
SOMEWHERE WHERE YOUR VICTIM WILL  
TOUCH.. DESK TOP, TOILET SEAT ETC.  
BECAUSE, AFTER A BIT, WHATEVER  
TOUCHES THE STUFF WILL BE STAINED  
REAL BLACK.. CLOTHES SKIN ETC.. AND,  
IT DONT WASH OFF.. IT WEARS OFF IN  
ABOUT A WEEK OR SO... SO THINK IF  
YOU HAD PUT IT ON SOMEONES HANDS,  
HAD THEN TOUCHED THEIR FACE.... HAHAHA

HOW TO HOTWIRE A CAR.  
 
THE EASIEST WAY IS TO JUST GET UNDER  
THE DASHBOARD AND START CROSSING WIRES.  
 
OF COURSE THIS COULD SHORT OUT THE ENTIRE  
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SO THERE IS A BETTER WAY.  
 
WHEN YOU GET IN THE CAR, LOOK UNDER THE  
DASH.  IF IT'S ENCLOSED THEN DON'T BOTHER.  
MOST NEW CARS ARE LIKE THIS UNFORTUNATELY.  
HOWEVER YOU COULD CUT THROUGH THE DASH.  
 
IF YOU DO CUT JUST DO IT NEAR THE IGNITION.  
ONCE YOU GET BEHIND OR NEAR THE IGNITION,  
LOOK FOR TWO RED WIRES.  IN OLDER CARS THIS  
WAS THE STANDARD COLOR CODE.  IF THEY AREN'T  
THERE YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY WHATEVER ELSE  
YOU CAN FIND.  
 
PULL OUT THE TWO WIRES AND CROSS THEM.  
THE CAR SHOULD START.

           Cable Descrambling  
        (Uploaded by Robin Hood)  
   
If you have cable TV but are not fortunate enough  
 to have the Premium services, here is a simple way  
to steal Cinemax, The Movie Channel, Showtime, the  
Disney Channel, and any other srvice that appears  
as a bussing fuzzy picture (that you can ALMOST  
get clearly by fine tuning). This method also  
works on channels that appear as a lined flashing  
screen that produce a beeping sound. These  
channels are not scrambled, but instead a garbage  
transmission is sent at the same frequency.  
Therefore, in order to receive the movie servcices  
clearly, you must filter out the garbage.  
   
Here is a simple way to do this:  
   
1) Examine the back of your TV set. Find the VHF  
antenna terminals (these are th antenna terminals  
that the cable service is hooked up to). Get a  
piece of antenna wire (about 3 feet long). Strip  
one end of the wire and and attach it to the VHF  
terminals along with the cable. Tune in to one of  
the movie services and adjust the fine tunr until  
you get the cleanest picture. Cut off about 1/4  
inch of the  antenna wire and adjust the fine  
tuner. Continue to do this until you get a nearly  
perfect picture (you should not have to cut off  
more than 6 inches of the antenna wire). Get a  
piece of luminum foil and wrap it around the  
antenna wire slide it up and down until you have a  
perfect picture. This is a simple yet effective  
way to get movies for free.

--------------------------------------  
 WELL LETS SEE HERE, MOST THINGS I   
 HAVE SEEN HAVE 6-10 DIGITS RIGHT?  
 YET CREDIT CARDS HAVE AROUND 20  
 DIGITS, WHY? WELL ITS NOT NECESSARY  
 OF COURSE FOR A CREDIT CARD TO HAVE  
 THAT MANY, BUT IT DOES! EACH CARD  
 HOLDER MUST HAVE A UNIQUE NUMBER OF  
 COURSE THO. VISA HAS MAYBE 70 MILLION  
 CARD HOLDERS AT THIS TIME, MASTERCARD  
 TOO. WHICH LEADS US TO 70 MILLION  
 AVAILABLE NUMBERS!   
  
 THERE ARE ONE HUNDERED MILLION  
 POSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF EIGHT DIGITS,  
 FROM 00000000 TO 99999999. SO EIGHT  
 DIGITS WOULD BE ENUF. TO ALLOW FER  
 FUTURE GROWTH, VISA COULD HAVE 9  
 DIDIGTS-ENUF FER ONE BILLION DIFFER  
 NUMBERS!  
  
 IN FACT, A VISA CARD HAS 13 DIGITS  
 AND SOMETIMES EVEN MORE. AN AMERICAN  
 EXPRESS HAS 15 DIGITS. DINERS CLUB  
 CARDS HAVE 14. CARTE BLANCHE HAS 10.  
 THEY ARE OBVOUSLY NOT EXPECTING  
 BILLIONS OF CARD OWNERS WITH THOSE  
 DIGITS. BUT ALL THE EXTRA ONES ARE  
 ONLY A SECRUITY DEVICE. I MEAN IF  
 THEY WERE 4 DIGITS EACH MOST PEOPLE  
 WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING   
 THEMSELVES 3232 FAKE CREDIT CARDS!  
  
 SAY YER VISA NUMBER IS 4321 876 132  
 564. EACH PURCHASE MUST BE ENTERD  
 FROM A SALES SLIP. THE ACCOUNT NUMBER  
 TAGS YER PURCHASE TO YER ACCOUNT.  
 SOMETIMES THE SALES PEOPLE GET BORED  
 AND ENTER THE WRONG NUMBER. THERE ARE  
 10 TRILLION POSSIBLE 13 DIGIT VISA  
 NUMBERS. ONLY ABOUT 65 MILLION OF  
 THOSE ARE WORKING ACCOUNTS! WHICH  
 MEANS IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND ONE.  
 THOSE ARE SLIM ODDS TO FIND THE NUMBER  
 YOU COULD FILL UP A BOOK FULL OF  
 13 DIGIT NUMBERS. STILL YOU WOULD NOT  
 DUPLICATE A VISA ACCOUNT NUMBER.  
  
 THEN WE HAVE MASTERCARD OF THE  
 QUADRILLION POSSIBLE COMBOS ONLY ABOUT  
 11 MILLION ARE ACTIVE ACCOUNTS. AMONG  
 OTHER THINGS, THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE  
 FER THEM TV, RADIO AND OTHER ADS TO  
 INVITE CARD HOLDERS TO CALL UP AND  
 ORDER. HOW CAN THEY BE SURE THE   
 GUY EVEN HAS A CARD?  
  
 THEY MUST BASE THERE CONFIDENCE ON  
 THE SECURTIY OF THE KREDT-KARD #ERING  
 SYSTEM. IF SOMEONE CALLS UP EVEN   
 MAKING SURE TO USE THE RIGHT NUMBER  
 OF DIGITS THE NUMBER WILL SURLEY NOT  
 EXIST. TO BE PRACTICAL THE ONLY WAY  
 TO GET A CREDIT CARD NUMBER IS TO GET  
 IT RIGHT OFF THE PLASTIC CARD.  
  
 SO HOW DO I GET THE CREDIT CARD   
 NUMBERS YOU ASK? THERE ARE TWO  
 VERY EASY WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE  
 ANYTIME, ONE IS GETTING IT OFF THE  
 OLE COPY THAT WUZ RUN OFF IN THE  
 STORE, SO IF THEY DONT THROW THE COPYS  
 AWAY PICK THEM UP AND ITS YERS..THEN  
 YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS VERY SIMPLE   
 TRICK OVER THE PHONE:  
  
 YOU: THIS IS BANK 1. WE ARE CALLING TO  
 TELL YOU THAT THE CREDIT LIMIT ON  
 YER MASTERCARD HAS BEEN RAISED TO  
 TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.  
  
 PERSON: BUT MY LIMIT HAS ALWAYS BEEN  
 10,000 DOLLARS!!!  
  
 YOU: HMMM.. THERE MUST BE SOME ERR  
 OR PROBLEM IN THE COMPUTERS. DO YOU  
 HAVE YOUR CARD HANDY? COULD YOU READ  
 OFF THE NUMBER?  
  
 RIGHT THERE THE PERSON IS VERY  
 WORRIED AND WANTS HIS LIMIT BACK SO  
 OF COURSE HE GIVES YOU THE NUMBER.

 -----------------------------  
 LETS MAKE THIS FAST SO WE CAN GET TO  
 THE LIE DETECTOR PART. THIS TRICK IS  
 QUITE SIMPLE. YOU WALK INTO A BIG  
 BIZ OFFICE THAT HAS IT SO YOU MUST  
 ENTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DIGITS  
 BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER. THEN IT WILL  
 OPE NTHE DORR FER YA. SO YOU GO OVER  
 AND CLEAN OFF THE PANEL AND WIPE OUT  
 ALL THE FINGERPRINTS, STAND OUTSIDE  
 THE DOOR AND WAIT FER A GUY TO GO  
 IN. HE WILL PUNCH THE NUMBERS AND  
 GO IN. TAKE OUT SUM FINGERPRINT DUST  
 AND YOU WILL SEE THE DIGITS. WRITE  
 THEM DOWN....YOU NOW KNOW THAT THOSE  
 DIGITS IN SOME KIND OF ORDER OPEN THE  
 DOOR!  
  
 (> THE LIE DETECTOR TEST <)

-----------=IODINE CRYSTALS=-----------  
  
 These little beauties are pressure  
sensitive so that the slightest touch  
will cause a fairly loud explosion.  
(About a fourth of a fire cracker per  
crystal) It may not seem like much,  
but there are usally about 500 crystals  
in a teaspoon of crystalized iodine.  
Also, when the first one goes off, it  
will most likely start a chain reaction  
and cause all of the others around it   
to go off too, which would cause all of  
the others around each one of those to  
go off ect...  
  
Materials:                       
1.  1 bottle of iodine crystals.  
2.  1 bottle of ammonia nitrate  
  
Instructions:                    
  
Mix 2 teaspoons of crytals with about  
4 ounces of ammonia. you might have to  
expirement with the measurements a   
little bit to see what works best.  
  
 Stir until dissolved, then pour it  
over the area that you want to trap.  
  
 Let the ammonia evaporate so all that  
will be left are the tiny crystals.  
(they are almost invisible)  
Then, when somebody steps on or sets  
something down on it...  
******HE'LL SHIT IN HIS PANTS!!!*******  
--------------=HAVE PHUN=--------------  
---------------------------------------  
       More things to do with potassium  
nitrate (besides gun powder  
Well a great thing to do is to mix it 50%  
with sugar and put it in a tin can with  
the top sawed off. Mix it well then light  
a match and trow it in while it is still  
flaring. Get back it will get very hot  
and make a lot of smoke. It will melt  
can to the ground. For the purists  
what is happening is the Potassium  
Nitrate is oxidizing the sugar which  
and good Bio student knows has high  
energy in it!!! So watch what is happening  
in your body and a slightly accelerated  
speed.  
---------------------------------------  
HOW TO MAKE GUNPOWDER...  
WELL THE INGREDIENTS ARE:  
    POTASSIUM NITRATE 85%  
    CARBON(CHARCOL)   12%  
    SULFUR             3%  
  
THEY ARE ROUGH PERCENTAGES BUT TRY  
A LITTLE LIKE THAT AND PLAY WITH IT.  
THE MORE POTASSIUM YOU ADD THE FASTER  
IT IWLL BURN. LESS SULFUR SLOWER. LESS  
CARBON THE LESS IT WILL BURN. WHAT  
YOU WILL DO IS JUST PUT THEM ALL IN  
A MIXING JAR, I USED A LITTLE CARDBOARD  
BOX WITH LOW SIDES AND THEN GROUND IT  
UP AND MIX TOGETHER. YOU CAN GET POTASSIUM  
NITRATE AT MOST DRUG STORES. IT IS COMMONLY  
KNOWN AS SALT PETER.     HAVE FUN.

Thanx: Mino Taur  
                                 =========  
                                 Landmines  
                                 =========  
  
First you need to get a push button switch... take the wires of it and  
connect one to a 9 volt battery connector and the other to a solar  
igniter (if you can't get that then use a thin piece of stereo wire).  
  
Connect the other wire of the 9 volt connector to to the other end of the  
solar igniter (stereo wire).  
  
Now... connect the end of a fuse (of a pipe bomb, M80, whatever has a fuse)  
to the solar igniter...  
  
Dig a hole... not to deep but enough to cover all the materials. Think about  
what direction your enemy will coming from and plant the switch, but leave  
the button visible (not to visible). Plant the explosive about 3 feet from  
the switch because there will be a delay in the explosion.  
And when your enemy steps on it...  
       B  O  O  M  !  !  !  
---------------------------------------  
Thanx: Mino Taur  
               ==========  
               Trip Wires  
               ==========  
  
     Well first of all I reccommend  
that you read the file on my board  
about landmines... If you can't then  
here is the conecpt. You can use an  
m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other  
type of elxplose that will light with  
a fuse. Now the way this works is  
if you have a 9volt batery, from a  
radio cthred car or what ever and  
get either a solor igniter (preferably)  
or some steel wool you can create  
a remote ignition system. What you  
do it set up a schematic like this.  
  
        ------------------>+ batery  
 steel ||                ->- batery  
 wool  ||                /  
  :==:---  <--fuse       \  
       ||                /  
       ---- spst switch--\  
  
So when the switch is on the currnet  
will flow through the steel wool or  
igniter and heat up causing the fuse  
to light.  
     Note: For use with steel wool  
try it first and get a really thin  
peice of wire and pump the current  
through it to make sure it will heat  
up to light the explosive.  
**********************************  
Now the thing to do is plant your  
explosive whereever you want it to  
be but bury it and cover the wires  
obviously... Now take a this wire  
fishing line is good about 20 lb.  
test and tie one end of the wire  
to a secure object. Have your switch  
secured to seomthing to and make a  
loop on the other end on the line.  
Put the loop around the switch such  
that when pulled it will pull the  
switch and set off the explosive.  
Remeber it may take a few seconds  
to ignite the explosive... The thing  
to do is to experiment with this  
and find your best method...

WHAT IS A POCKET ROCKET ?  
-------------------------  
A DEVICE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 1 3/4  
INCHES LONG , THAT WHEN PROPERLY MADE  
WILL FLY 4-8 FEET, IF PROPERLY SET OFF.  
ALTHOUGH NOT A POWERFUL DEVICE, IT IS   
WELL SUITED TO ANNOYING YOUR DORM-MATE,  
OR PERHAPS A CLASSMATE DURING THOSE  
OFTEN RECURRING SESSIONS OF BOREDOM.  
  
MATERIALS NEEDED  
----------------  
1-PACKET OF MATCHES (CARDBOARD MATCHES,  
  NOT WOODEN ONES)  
1-PIN (A SMALL ONE , STEAL IT FROM MOMS  
  SEWING BASKET)  
1-PIECE OF ALUMINUM FOIL , 1 SQUARE   
  INCH FOR EVERY ROCKET (REYNOLDS WRAP)  
1-PAIR OF SCISSORS (OPTIONAL)  
1-PAPER CLIP (OPTIONAL)  
1-CIGARETTEE LIGHTER (OPTIONAL)  
  
MAKING THE LITTLE BUGGERS  
-------------------------  
OKAY SO YOU'VE RAIDED THE HOUSE FOR ALL  
THE STUFF....  
1) TAKE THE PACK OF MATCHES APART BY  
   REMOVING THE LITTLE STAPLE AT THE   
   BOTTOM.  
2) USE THE SCISORS TO CUT OFF A SINGLE  
   MATCH FROM THE BUNCH.  
3) CUT OUT A 1 INCH SQUARE OF ALUMINUM  
   FOIL AND FOLD IT IN HALF.  
4) PUT THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IN THE  
   CENTER OF THE CREASE AND PRESS THE  
   FOIL SO IT FORMS AROUND THE HEAD  
5) WRAP THE REST OF THE FOIL AROUND THE  
   MATCH HEAD AS TIGHTLY AND NEATLY AS  
   POSSIBLE.  
  
NOW U HAVE A MATCH WITH THE HEAD   
WRAPPED UP IN FOIL , WITH THE FOIL  
COMING 1/2 INCH DOWN FROM THE HEAD.  
THIS IS THE WAY YOU'D STORE THEM IF YOU  
WEREN'T GOING TO FIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY.  
  
*NOTE* - NEATNESS COUNTS , TIGHTNESS  
COUNTS , YES YOU CAN JUST RIP A MATCH  
OUT , AND RIP FOIL , BUT THE END RESULT  
WON'T WORK AS WELL.  
  
PREPARATION FOR LAUNCH  
----------------------  
1) TAKE THE PIN AND PUSH IT UNDER THE  
   FOIL UNTIL YOU FEEL THE POINT START  
   TO CRUSH THE HEAD. KEEP THE PIN AS  
   CLOSE TO THE MATCH AS POSSIBLE WHEN  
   DOING THIS.  
2) BEND THE PAPER CLIP TO FORM A 45 DEG  
   ANGLE WITH THE HORIZON , AND SET IT  
   ON A RELATIVELY NON-FLAMMABLE   
   SURFACE , POINTING IN THE DIRECTION  
   YOU WISH TO FIRE THE ROCKET.  
3) REMOVE THE PIN FROM THE MATCH AND  
   GINGERLY SET THE MATCH ON THE PAPER  
   CLIP, BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CRUSH THE  
   FOIL DOWN (THE PLACE THE PIN WAS IS  
  NOW THE EXHAUST PORT).  
  
LAUNCH  
------  
HEAT THE HEAD OF THE MATCH (THE PART  
COVERED WITH FOIL) TILL IGNITION.  
  
NOTES  
-----  
NEATNESS ALWAYS COUNTS ON THESE BUGGERS  
, ALWAYS USE SCISSORS WHEN POSSIBLE.  
YOU SHOULD USE A LIGHTER INSTEAD OF A  
MATCH SO U DONT GET SCORCHED FINGERS.  
I HAVE YET TO GET A 2 STAGE ROCKET TO  
FLY , IF YOU DO UPDATE THE FILE. IF ALL  
OF THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU THEN  
PERHAPS PAGE 45 OF 'THE GREAT   
INTERNATIONAL PAPER AIRPLANE BOOK' SAID  
IT BETTER...  
  
  "POCKET ROCKET. INSTRUCTIONS: WRAP  
   ALUMINUM FOIL AROUND UPPER HALF OF  
   PAPER MATCH. PUSH STRAIGHT PIN UP  
   UNDER FOIL TO HEAD OF MATCH AND   
   REMOVE AGAIN LEAVING EXHAUST   
   CHANNEL. PLACE MATCH ON OPENED  
   PAPER CLIP AND HOLD LIGHTED MATCH  
   TO TIP. STEP BACK."

     I have decided to skip the article on mercury fluminate for a  
while and get right into the dynamite article.  
  
     Dynamite is nothing more than just nitroglycerin and a stablizing  
agent to make it much safer to use.  For the sake of saving time, I  
will abbreviate nitroglycerin with a plain NG.  The numbers  
are percentages, be sure to mix these carefully and be sure to use the  
exact amounts.  These percentages are in weight ratio, not volume.

or more of the ingredients try another one.  If you still can't, you  
can always buy small amounts from your school, or maybe from various  
chemical companies.  When you do that, be sure to say as little as  
possible, if during the school year, and they ask, say it's for a  
experement for school.

                             Carbide Bomb  
                             ------------  
This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some  
calcium carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and  
can be found at nearly any hardware store. Take a few pieces of this  
stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a glass jar with some  
water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with the water to  
produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in  
cutting torches. Eventually the glass with explode from internal  
pressure. If you leave a burning rag nearby, you will get a nice  
fireball!

If you have a bow, this one is for you. Remove the ferrule from an  
aluminum arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade  
FFFF, it burns easy)and then glue a shotshell primer into the hole  
left where the ferrule went. Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you  
are ready to go! Make sure no one is nearby.... Little shreds of  
aluminim go all over the place!!

                      Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower  
                      --------------------------  
For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a  
switch. Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of  
the tailpipeby drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.  
Attach the wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the  
switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached  
to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply  
hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be careful that no  
one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20 feet!!!

                       Improvising Black Powder  
                           By: Mr. Byte-Zap  
  
                          The Police Station  
                             612-934-4880  
  
     Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner.  It may be  
used as blasting or gun powder.  
  
Material required:  
-----------------  
potassium nitrate, granulated, 3 cups  
wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups  
sulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup  
alcohol, 5 pints (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)  
Water, 3 cups  
heat source  
2 buckets -- each 2 gallon capacity, at least one of which is heat  
             resistant (metal, ceramic, etc.)  
Flat window screening, at least 1 ft. Square  
large wooden stick  
cloth, at least 2 ft. Square  
  
note: the above amounts will yield 2 pounds of black powder.  However,  
      only the ratios of the amounts of the ingredients are important.  
      Thus, for twice as much black powder, double all quantities  
      used.  
  
Procedure:  
---------  
1) place alcohol in one of the buckets
  
2) place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant  
   bucket.  Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until  
   all ingredients are dissolved.
  
3) Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture.  Place bucket on heat  
   source and stir until small bubbles begin to form.  
Caution:  do not boil mixture.  Be sure all mixture stays wet.  If any  
          is dry, as on sides of pan, it may ignite.
  
4) Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while  
   stirring vigorously  
  
5) let alcohol stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to  
   obtain black powder.  Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around black  
   powder and squeeze to remove all excess liquid.  
  
6) Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable amount of damp  
   powder on screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen  
note: if granulated particles appear to stick together and change  
      shape, recombine entire batch of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.  
  
7) Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about  
   1/2 inch is formed.  Allow to dry.  Use radiator , or direct  
   sunlight.  This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in  
   one hour.  The longer the drying period, the less effective the  
   black powder.  
Caution: remove from heat as soon as granules are dry.  Black powder  
         is now ready for use.

                           Harmless Terror  
                           By: The Prowler  
  
                          The Police Station  
                             612-934-4880  
  
To all those who do not wish to inflict bodily damage on their victems  
but only terror.  
These are weapons that should be used from high places.  
  
1) The flour bomb.  
   Take a wet paper towel and pour a given amount of baking flour in  
   the center. Then wrap it up and put on a rubber band to keep it  
   together. When thrown it will fly well but when it hits, it covers  
   the victim with the flower or causes a big puff of flour which will  
   put the victim in terror since as far as they are concerned, some  
   strange white powder is all over them. This is a cheap method of  
   terror and for only the cost of a roll of paper towels and a bag of  
   flour you and your friends can have loads of fun watching people  
   flee in panic.  
  
2) Smoke bomb projectile.  
   All you need is a bunch of those little round smoke bombs and a  
   wrist rocket or any sling-shot. Shoot the smoke bombs and watch the  
   terror since they think it will blow up!  
  
3) Rotten eggs (good ones)  
   take some eggs and get a sharp needle and poke a small hole in the  
   top of each one. Then let them sit in a warm place for about a  
   week. Then you've got a bunch of rotten eggs that will only smell  
   when they hit.  
  
4) Glow in the dark terror.  
   Take one of those tubes of glow in the dark stuff and pour the  
   stuff on whatever you want to throw and when it gets on the victim,  
   they think it's some deadly chemical or a radioactive substance so  
   they run in total panic. This works especially well with flower  
   bombs since a gummy, glowing substance gets all over the victim.  
  
5) Fizzling panic.  
   Take a baggie of a water-baking soda solution and seal it. (Make  
   sure there is no air in it since the solution will form a gas and  
   you don't want it to pop on you.) Then put it in a bigger plastic  
   bag and fill it with vinegar and seal it. When thrown, the two  
   substances will mix and cause a violently bubbling substance to go  
   all over the victim.
