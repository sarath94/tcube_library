  How many times have you wanted to 
 seriously scare someone or better 
 yet, throw flaming projectiles at 
 their house, but didnt want to get 
 caught? Well, Now you can! By 
 modifying certain remote control toys 
 you too can hide up in a tree and 
 blow up things by just pressing a 
 button. 
  Using this system, I've modified 
 a very expensive tank without ruin- 
 ing it, or taking away any of its 
 controls. 
 
 To start: 
   You will need: 
     A remote control toy (one with 
      a headlights or cannon button 
      will work nicely) 
     30-70 feet of wire (2 leads!) 
     phono plug & jack 
     a few scraps of small wire 
     a multimeter (meter designed 
      for testing voltages and 
      resistance) 
     a solar ignitor 
     a model rocket or m-80 
 
  Begin by getting into the toy. I 
 will use for an example the tank 
 I've modified. There were four 
 screws on the bottom that held 
 the turret and cover on. I 
 removed these and the cover 
 easily came off. There may be a 
 screw under a sticker if yours 
 has a warrantee on it. 
  When this is done you'll probab- 
 ly see a lot of mumbo jumbo. You 
 have to examine the toy to find 
 where the wires connecting to the 
 headlights or searchlight or fake 
 cannon is. The toys with the 
 lightbulbs are the easiest to 
 modify (a car is SIMPLE). Now 
 turn on the toy and press the 
 headlight button or whatever 
 control you've found to make sure 
 it works. With my tank, it has a 
 searchlight on top, and when you 
 press "cannon" on the remote 
 control, the light goes on, very 
 handy... 
  Now test the voltage. It should 
 be at least about 2 1/2 - 3v. If 
 it isn't there may not be enough 
 voltage, but it still may work 
 depending on what solar ignitors 
 you have. My tank had 6 volts. 
 You must also be sure that your 
 device uses a few batteries. It 
 takes a little Amperage to set 
 off those babies, and one or two 
 small batteries just won't do. 
  Now find a place on the toy 
 where there is room for a phono 
 jack to fit in with a little 
 room. The Driver's compartment 
 on cars is good, on my tank 
 there is a turret with a lot of 
 room inside. 
  Now drill a hole in that spot 
 big enough for the phono jack 
 to fit. After thats done, test 
 fit it. Then solder two wires 
 one to the prong, and one to 
 the center protrusion of the 
 phono jack. You'll understand 
 once you see the phono jack. 
 The wires must be long enough 
 to reach the point where you 
 tested (the headlights, search 
 light, etc.). Finally screw the 
 plug in. 
  There should be two wires 
 coming from the light. No need 
 to disconnect these, but also 
 solder the two wires from the 
 phono jack onto the connection.

                        light 
 
 That should clarify a little. 
 Before soldering the second 
 wire to the light, check the 
 phono jack for a short circuit. 
 A short circuit would ruin the 
 whole thing. To do this change 
 the multimeter to Ohms and 
 place one of the leads on the 
 second unsoldered wire and the 
 other to the first wire. The 
 Ohms should read 1 or No 
 Connection. If there is a con- 
 nection, then check the phono 
 jack for a short. The circuit 
 should not complete through 
 the jack (yet). After this 
 then solder the second 
 wire to the light. 
  Now put the toy together 
 again. Part 1 is completed. 
  Strip both ends of the 30 
 foot wire (each lead). Connect 
 the two leads at one end of 
 the wire to the phono plug. 
 Follow up by screwing the cap 
 onto the plug. The other end 
 just leave plain (make sure 
 the leads aren't touching). 
 You are done!!! 
  You should have a car or tank 
 with a jack sticking out of it 
 and a 30 foot line with a 
 phono plug at the end. 
 
          To Fire 
          == ==== 
 
 Connect the solar ignitor to 
 the ends of the plain 30 foot 
 wire, and tape it into the 
 rocket or onto the m-80. You 
 must be careful here. In some 
 toys a glitch may cause the 
 solar ignitor to go off. Put 
 the explosive where you want it 
 then stretch the wire to where 
 the car or tank is. Turn the 
 toy on then plug the wire into 
 it. Go climb up a tree and turn 
 the remote control on. Press 
 Headlights or Cannon and the car 
 will look like it went dead (neat 
 effects eh?). Then the rocket, 
 m-80, or whatever will explode. 
 Then you can drive away with the 
 wires! Nobody will have seen you 
 light it up, and you can just 
 stay there and watch all the 
 people run around looking for 
 somebody to blame! MWAHAHA!
