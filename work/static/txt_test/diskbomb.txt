
Disk Bomb by The Talon

The disk bomb is a wonderful way to get back at a person you just
can't stand, one who constantly asks for games, etc.

Materials:

1 diskette
2 blue-tip matches
Clear nail polish

Procedure:

Carefully crush the heads of the blue-tip matches (they must be
blue-tip or this will not work!) into powder. Mix the powder to be
sure all of the blue igniting chemical that the matches are treated
with is mixed in.

Spread this powder very thinly on the surface of the disk inside the
read/ write access hole.

Carefully pour a very small amount of the nail polish on the powder
and spread it out on the disk surface in the read/write access oval.

Wait about an hour for the nail polish to dry.

Turn the inside of the disk so that the powder mixture is not seen.

Give the disk to the intended victim.


If this is done properly, within 30 sec of boot-up, the friction
caused by the spinning diskette will ignite the powdered sulfur. The
burning sulfur will then ignite the plastic diskette, melting it,
causing a great mess inside the victim's drive.
