                   Chapter the First: A Short Introduction
______________________________________________________________________________
 
    Well, this bomb was constructed by us in an attempt to not only make an
antipersonnel device which was easy to construct, but also to create the 
biggest fireball that the world has ever seen.  So, you get the power of pure
butane, with the added advantage of simplicity in construction...have phun!

                    Chapter the Next: Materials Required
______________________________________________________________________________

    1.  A Cannister of Butane Fuel: Easy to obtain, this can be found at just
        about any good drugstore, certainly at a hardware store.

    2.  Gun Powder: Not all that tough to get ahold of, either find a phile
        telling you how to construct it by hand, or snag some shotgun shells 
        at K-Mart and empty the powder out of them.  You can use firecrackers
        instead of shotgun shells, but you'll need a sufficient amount of
        powder, so unless you want to spend five years emptying firecrackers,
        stick to the shells.

    3.  Plastic Container: Preferably a TupperWare-(tm) glass, as it will both
        melt away and explode, while glass will shatter with heat, and metal
        will not explode.

    4.  A Fuse: You can buy these in places, but if you don't want to go thru
        the hassle, simply rub model glue all over a string, it'll work just
        as well.

    5.  Masking Tape: Or electrical tape, or cellophane tape, or whatever kind
        of tape that you've got lying 'round the house.

                         Chapter the Third: Assembly
______________________________________________________________________________

    1.  Fill the plastic container with 1/4 to 1/2 inch of powder.

    2.  Center the butane in the container, atop the powder.

    3.  Fill the rest of the container with powder, around the butane.  Pack
        it down -- lightly, just so that it fully fills in the container.

    4.  Insert the fuse at least 1/2 inch into the powder, and pack the
        surrounding powder as in step 3.  Seal the top of the container around
        the butane with a small covering of masking tape.

    5.  Plant the device in a target area.

    6.  Light the fuse, and...

    7.  RUN LIKE HELL!!

    8.  (Detonation): If this is done correctly, and you get well out of range
        of the fireball, the immediate, (and non-immediate), area will be "up
        in smoke," persay.
