Have you ever been just walking around downtown and had nothing to do? Well, so
you won't be bored anymore, try some of these.
 
Me and Fixer were walking on the roof of London Drugs and we saw these punkers
come by. So we started mouthing them and spitting at them from the roof. They
really got pissed and starting throwing rocks at us. So we pegged this one guy
with Fixer's slingshot. It was hilarious, seeing this guy with a mohawk
screaming in pain. The other punkers started running and we had fun watching
them dodge the rocks that we through at them. Wonder what ever happened to
them?
 
Walk up to the people who are playing the guitars and other instruments on the
street for money and start telling the how shitless their music is. Or instead
of throwing money in their case, throw a banana peel or orange rines into it.
Watch them keep playing, but they are really brewing inside. This is really
fun.
 
Walk into a store and ask them if they sell condems. There is nothing wrong
with that. But try and re-act this conversation:
 
Sale girl: Hi, what may I do for you?
 
You: Hi, do you have any condems?
 
Sales girl: * Ahem *, yes we do, step this way.
 
You: Thank you very much, I need them because I am going to get laid tonight.
 
Sales girl: Uh, yeah. Okay, here they are.
 
You: Um, I don't know, my penis is much larger then that.
 
Sales girl: Uh, w-w-ell, um, I w-will s-s-ee if w-w-w-we have any i-i-n
            s-stock.
 
You: Thanks very much. Please hurray.
 
Time passes...
 
Sales girl: H-H-Hi, here is our largest condem in stock.
 
You: Sorry, I have a 11 incher, that is still to small. Thanks anyways.
 
This is really fun. The sales girl really is freaking out. This is for the
people who have alot of guts. But the outcome is so hilarious.
 
Krazy Glue a dildo to the wall of some building without being seen. Then go sit
down where you can watch the people passing by. Watch their faces as they see
the dildo on the wall.
 
Climb up onto the roof of some low building so you can not be seen. Then yell
really loud: *** RAPE! ***. This is hilarious, watching the people scatter!
 
Walk into a store and pretend you are seriously mental. Bang into people and 
call out dirty names. Go take things that are worth value and don't pay for
them, but when the owner comes up to you, talk like you are mental, and when
he tries to take it away, really pretend like you are mental, and throw a 
temper tantrum.
 
Well, that is it for now. Thanx to the Fixer for being such a PYRO and having a
nice sadistic attitude. Anyways, if you think of anymore fun things to do,
leave me mail on one of the boards mentioned...
 
This has been a MegaDeath presentation. 02/04/87.
