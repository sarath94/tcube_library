  I am not too sure on how this works
but I am pretty sure that you can make
a really powerful bomb by taking a can
of draino and mixing it with Chlorox.
I think that these two compuonds will
spontaniously explode so don't just pour
them together. I think what you do is
get the draino in a cardboard can and
then put it in a bucket of chlorox
and what will happen is either the
draino or chlorox will eat through
the cardboard and they will meet and
explode. You might want to experiment
with this by rigging it up so you can
cause the two to combine while you
stand a distance a way. I reccomend
extreme caution with this and wear
goggles definately.... Just like
pour some chlorox into a pan and
then have a can of draino with a
string tied to it so you can make it
spill into the chlorox... Be Care
full. I don't need a law suit...
