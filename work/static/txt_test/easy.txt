                        THE TERRORIST HANDBOOK
                      (the short, short version)
                         (In six easy steps)

1.  Get a bomb (preferably one with a timer).
2.  Place bomb in a well populated area.
3.  Threaten them.
4.  Demand money, power, whatever floats your boat.
5.  If they don't meet your demands, blow them up.
6.  If they meet your demnads, Ehh..Blow them up anyway.

These will assure you a successful life as a terrorist,
although if you keep blowing them up even if they pay,
they might just stop paying.  Then that's when you retire,
and sell encyclopedias.
