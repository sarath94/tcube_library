>--------Equipment--------<
     Two people
    2 Masks (or some disguise)
    A pair of binoculars, telephoto lens, or telescope
    Gloves (two pairs, one for each participant)
    Method of Communication (ie walkie talkies, flashlight)
------------------------------------------------------<

--------------The Setting--------------<
     Ok, its a winter night (Late). Possibly snowing, but it must be cold. A
an/woman parks their car at a bank. Since its cold out they leave the car
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   unning. Meanwhile, the victim uses the automatic teller machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

----------------The Crime----------------<
     Criminal #1 waits a good distance away, hidden. His job is to watch the
ictims actions at the teller machine. Criminal #2 hides somewhere close to the
arking lot. If a flashlight is being used to cue Criminal #2, then he must
ave a good view of where #1 is hidden. Ok, so the victim arrives! #1 watches
he victim through his optical equipment. The banker inserts his/her card and
ypes in their password. Now, Criminal #1 signals #2. Quickly, #2 runs to the
ar and drives off at a slow pace, being as noisy and obvious as possible. Now
he victim can do one of two things. He can press all the buttons necessary to
et their card out of the machine (taking about 2 mins), Or he can run after
he car. Either way the guy is screwed!
PLAN A (ie victim runs after his/her car)
     -Criminal #1 leaves his hiding place and runs to the teller machine and
ithdraws as much as possible. (somewhere around $300) <<Remember to wear your
ask, teller machines have video camera's!!!>>
    -Criminal #2 keeps leading the banker on with the impression that he might
e able to get his car back long enough for #1 to get the dough.  Then he takes
ff at 60 mph!
     --) Gain.
          $300 (+/-)
         1 automobile (w/gas)
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   ____________________________________________________________________________
PLAN B (ie Banker retrieves banking card)
     -Criminal #1 takes off. (after throwing a few snowballs at the banker)
    -Criminal #2 keeps the car.
     --) Gain.
          1 automobile (w/gas)
>-------------------------------------------(E)(S)(L)(F)--------------------<
  Modifications:
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     If you are only interested in cash, and not grand theft auto; ditch the
ar a few blocks away. This also gives the banker more reason to run after his car.

 Not getting caught:
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     1> Always wear your masks and gloves! No faces or finger prints.
    2> Don't repeat the crime in the same place too often.
    3> ESLF members never get caught!
    4> Don't tell anyone.
    5> Criminal #1, make sure there are no other passengers in the car.
    6> Only act in a one car situation. Watch for other people comming to
       use the teller machine.
     Notes:
    ^^^^^
    
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                       Now, if you fallow these rules you really shouldn't get caught. If you
lan on keeping the car, the risk runs significantly higher. Seriously, on a
tormy winter night, at like 11 pm; who's going to catch you? 
     Answer: A cop who watched you.  <just don't let this happen>
     ......good luck   -The Shadow
