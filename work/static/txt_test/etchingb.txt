Etching Solution Bomb

Ingredients:

   * 2 liter bottle

   * aluminum foil

   * etching solution (available at most Radio Shack stores used for
     etching electronic panels)

Procedure:

   * Take an empty 2 Liter bottle, plastic preferably. You may use glass if
     you have big balls and fast legs!

   * Tear a bunch of aluminum foil into tiny little balls and fill the
     2liter just at the base where the hard plastic cover is.

   * Take the solution and pour about 3 oz or enough to just make an even
     mixture. (pour fast though)

   * Place the cap on and shake just twice really fast...put the bottle
     down and run like hell.

You get a nice loud explosion and a nasty yellow mess that is really hard
to clean up espically on glass!

WARNING: Do not get the solution on your clothes or skin. It's a lot like
HCL but reacts more violently with aluminum.
