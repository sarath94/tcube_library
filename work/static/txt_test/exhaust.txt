
Exhaust Bomb
------------
        Install a spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tail
        pipe by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
        Attach a wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the
        switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached
        to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply
        hit the switch and watch the flames.
