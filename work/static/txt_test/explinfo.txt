PETROLEUM JELLY AND POTASSIUM  CHLORATE IN A 1 TO 1 RATIO BY WEIGHT MAKES A
TOTALY SAFE WHEN WET COMPOUND BUT IS HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE WHEN
DRY.

                        3 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE
                        5 GRAMS OF IODINE IN A BEAKER WITH 50ML
                          OF WATER MIXED ALL TOGETHER. ADD 20ML
                          OF AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE (AMMONIA WATER 10%)


FILTER AND THE RESULTING SOLID IS CALLED NITROGEN TRIIODIDE. WHEN WET IS VERY
SAFE BUT UPON DRYING BECOMES VERY EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE , TO THE POINT
OF A FEATHER SETTING IT OFF.

TO SET OFF THE ABOVE EXPLOSIVES ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS PUT SOME OF THE
MIXTURE ON OR IN SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT SORT OF LIKE AN INPACT BOMB. IT
EXPLODES NON INPACT WITH ANOTHER OBJECT.
