                         MAKING THERMITE
                           BY XCALIBUR

  THERMITE IS A POWERFUL SUBSTANCE WHIC H CAN BURN THROUGH PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING, SAVE TUNGSTEN. IT  IS ESPECIALLY OF USE IN TRYING TO CRACK OPEN A
FORTRESS FONE.   NOW HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE IT. IT IS VERY SIMPLE. THE FIRST STEP
I N MAKING THERMITE IS TO MAKE HEMATITE. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, HEMAT ITE IS IRON
OXIDE (RUST). HERE IS A GOOD METHOD OF MAKING LARGE Q UANTITIES OF RUST. OU
WILL ELECTROLYZE A METAL ROD, SUCH AS A COMM ON NAIL. YOU WILL NEED A SOURCE
OF DC POWER AS WELL. AN ELECTRIC  TRAIN TRANSFORMER IS PERFECT. ATTATCH THEROD
TO THE POSITIVE  WIRE.
                               ^^^^^^^^
THEN PLACE THE ROD AND THE NEGATIVE WIR E IN OPPOSITE SIDES OF A GLASS JAR
FILLED WITH WATER. PUT A LITT LE SALT IN THE WATER, JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT
CONDUCT WELL (A TEASP OON). LET THE SETUP SIT OVERNIGHT. IN THE MORNING, THERE
WILL B E A DARK RED CRUD IN THE JAR. FILTER ALL THE CRUD OUT OF THE WAT ER OR
JUST FISH IT OUT WITH A SPOON. NOW YOU WILL NEED TO DRY  IT OUT. HEAT IT IN AN
IRON POT UNTILL IT ALL TURNS A NICE LIGHT RE D. THE OTHER INGREDIANT YOU WILL
NEED IS ALUMINUM FILINGS. YOU  CAN EITHER FILE DOWN A BAR OF ALUMINUM, OR (AS
I SUGGEST) BUY ALUM INUM FILINGS AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE SHOP. (IF YOU BUY THE
BAR USE  NO LESS THAN 94% PURE ALUMINUM. IT IS CALLED DURALUMIN.) THAT 'S
ALMOST IT. NOW, MIX TOGETHER THE RUST AND ALUMINUM FILINGS.  THE RATIO SHOULD
BE 8 GRAMS OF RUST PER 3 GRAMS OF ALUMINUM F ILINGS. THAT'S THERMITE!   NOW,
TO LIGHT IT! STICK A LENGTH OF M AGNESIUM RIBBON IN A PILE OF THE THERMITE.
(EITHER STEAL IT FROM  CHEM LAB OR BUY IT AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE. IF
NOT, ORDER FRO M A CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSE. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP.) THE RIBBON
SHOULD S TICK INTO THE THERMITE LIKE A FUSE.  NOW YOU LIGHT THE MAGNESI UM
WITH A BLOWTORCH. (DON'T WORRY. THE TORCH ISN'T HOT ENOUG H TO LIGHT THE
THERMITE.) WHEN THE BURNING MAGNESIUM REACHES THE  THERMITE, IT WILL LIGHT.
WHEN THE THERMITE BURNS, GET THE HELL B ACK! THAT STUFF CAN VAPORIZE CARBON
STEEL. IT DOES WONDERS  ON HUMAN FLESH.

                         EXPLOSIVE INFO
                         ==============

  WHEN PETROLEUM JELLY AND POTASSIUM CH LORATE ARE MIXED IN A ONE TO ONE RATIO
BY WEIGHT, IT MAKES A TOTA LY SAFE WET COMPOUND BUT WHEN DRIED IT BECOMES
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE  AND SHOCK SENSITIVE.

  MIX 3 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE AND 5  GRAMS OF IODINE IN A BEAKER WITH 50
ML OF WATER. THEN ADD 20  ML OF AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE [AMMONIA WATER 10%]. FILTER
THIS SUBSTA NCE AND THE RESULTING SOLID IS CALLED NITROGEN TRIIODIDE. WHE N
THIS IS WET IT IS SAFE, BUT WHEN DRY BECOMES VERY EXPLOSIVE AND  SHOCK
SENSITIVE.

 (TO SET OFF ABOVE EXPLOSIVES, PUT THE  MIXTURE ON OR IN SOMETHING THE DROP IT
SORT OF LIKE AN IMPACT BOMB . IT, LIKE A HAND GRENADE, WILL EXPLODE ON CONTACT
WITH ANOTHER OB JECT.)  FOR GREAT SMOKE BOMBS, MIX 4 PARTS SUG AR AND 6 PARTS
POTASSIUM NITRATE (SALT PETER) AND HEAT IT OVER A  LOW FLAME UNTIL IT MELTS.
STIR WELL, THEN POUR IT INTO A CONTAINE R YOU DON'T NEED. BEFORE IT
SOLIDIFIES, PUT A FEW MATHES ON THE  SURFACE AS FUSES. ONE POUND OF THIS
SUBSTANCE WILL FILL A BLO CK NICELY WITH THICK WHITE
SMOKE.

                          Nitroglycerin

HERE IS AN ADDITION TO THE FILE ON EXPL OSIVES IN THE GENERAL SECTION.

NITROGLYCERIN:

*CAREFULLY* MIX EQUAL AMOUNTS OF NITRIC  ACID AND SULPHURIC ACID TOGETHER IN A
GRADUATED CYLINDER OR OTH ER TALL, THIN CONTAINER. SLOWLY ADD ORDINARY
GLYCERIN AND STIR V ERY LIGHTLY. WAIT A WHILE, AND POUR OFF THE LIQUID ON THE
TOP. THI S LIQUID IS NITROGLYCERI N, AND SHOULD BE HANDELED WITH CAUTION. 
WASHING IT WITH SODIUM CARBONATE WILL IMPROVE THE PURITY.

                          HOW TO MAKE:
                              T.N.T
  ---------------------------------------

MIX 170 PARTS TOLULENE WITH 100 PARTS A CID. THE ACID MADE OF 2 PARTS OF 70%
NITRIC AND 3 PARTS OF 100%  SULFURIC. MIX BELOW 30 DEGREES.SET THIS FOR 30 MIN
AND LET IT  SEPARATE. TAKE THE MONONITROTOLULENE AND MIX 100 PART OF I T WITH
215 PARTS OF ACID. THIS ACID IS 1 PART PURE NITRIC AND 2 P ARTS PURE SUL
FURIC. KEEP THE TEMP. AT 60-70 WHILE THEY ARE SLOWL Y MIXED. RAISE TEMP TO
90-100 AND STIR FOR 30 MIN. THE DINITRO TOLUENE IS SEPARATED AND MIX 100 PARTS
OF THIS WITH 225 PARTS OF  20% OLEUM WHICH IS 100% SULFURIC WITH 20% EXTRA
DISSOLVED SULFU R TRIOXIDE, AND 65 PARTS NITRIC ACID. HEAT AT 95 DEGREES FOR
60  MIN. AND THEN AT 120 DEGREES FOR 90 MIN.SEPARATE THE TRINITR OTOLUENE AND
SLOSH IT AROUND IN HOT WATER. PURIFY THE POWDER  BY SOAKING IT IN BENZENE. AND
THATS IT YOU KNOW HAVE TNT.

         Common Rocket Fuel
         ------------------

         Materials:

1.) Potassium Nitrate (KNO ) or 
                          3
    "Saltpeter". This can be obtained
    from a drugstore, or ordered from
    a chemical supply house.
                          
2.) Sugar (Powdered is the best)

         Procedure:

1.) Mix the two together 1/2 Nitrate
    and 1/2 Sugar.

2.) Take an old cooking pan, and
    melt the two together. There
    is NO way for it to ignite.

3.) It should turn into a fudgey
    looking compound. Pour this
    compound into a rocket engine
    such as a cardboard tube, and
    set a fuse into the compound
    and let the compound harden.

         Chlorate Mixtures
         -----------------

NOTE: The main ingredient for this
      experiment is potassium or 
      sodium chlorate.  Both of these
      will do equally well.  However,
      both may prove difficult to
      find.  Probably the only way to
      get it would be to order it 
      through a chemical supply house.

Materials: 
----------

1) Potassium chlorate or sodium 
   chlorate.

2) Powdered charcoal

3) Powdered aluminum
 
4) Sulfur

Procedure:
----------

NOTE:  There is no set procedure for
       making chlorate mixtures.
       The only special thing ABOUT
       chlorate mixtures is that
       they have a chlorate in them.
       Experiment with diffiernt 
       proportions of each of the 
       ingredients. All of the
       chlorate mixtures I made had
       no set procedure and I just
       experimented with the 
       proportions of each of the
       ingredients. Most of your 
       mixture, however, should be
       potassium chlorate or sodium
       chlorate.

1)  Make sure that you mix the 
    sulfur and charcoal and aluminum
    first.  You may grind  these in
    a mortar and pestal to get a good
    mix of these ingredients.

2)  Add potassium chlorate or sodium
    chlorate.  Mix them VERY CAREFULLY
    in the mortar and pestal.  DO NOT
    GRIND the mixture once the 
    chlorate has been added or it will
    ignite and burn the shit out of
    you.

3)  You now may use the mixture for
    whatever you want to.  Chlorate
    mixtures are some of the best
    compositions there are and, in 
    my experiences, they are the best
    except for model  rocket 
    propellant (procedure for making
    this is given later).

Materials
---------

1.) Zinc (Zn) <---NOTE: This is not the
                        same as Zinc
                        Oxide!
2.) Sulfur (S)

Procedure
---------

1.) Mix the two together 1/2 and 1/2.

2.) MAKE SURE that you mix them very
    well. The best way to do so, is to
    put the mixture in a jar with a lid
    and shake it up for 15-60 seconds,
    until it is all a greyish color.

3.) To ignite, use a fuse, or throw a 
    match into the powder. WARNING,
    this burns very very quickly, and
    produces smoke. Also it burns at
    a fairly high temperature. It will
    surprise you when you throw a match
    into it. There will be a delay, and
    then all of a sudden, it will flash
    up, and is capable of burning the
    hell out of you.

Common Uses
-----------

1.) Rocket Fuel
2.) Bombs <--- NOTE: The best way to do
                     this is to take
                     it and compress
                     it into cardboard
                     tubing.
3.) Smoke bombs (Cardboard tube w/ big
                 hole.)
4.) Flare bombs.
5.) The rest is up to your imagination

          GOOD LUCK!

         Nitrate Compound
         ----------------
Materials
---------

1.) Potassium Nitrate (KNO )
                          3

2.) Aluminum Powder (dust) (Al)

3.) Sulfur (S)

Procedure
---------

1.) Take 2 Tablespoons KNO
                          3

2.) 2 Tablespoons Al

3.) 1/2-1 Tablespoon S

4.) Mix and shake, until all is one
    solid color. Silver-grey. 

5.) You can light this with a fuse
    or throw a match into it to light.
    You may experiment with the ratios.
    Here are a few tips:

    a.) To make more smoke add more
        sulfur to the mixture.
    b.) To make it burn slower, add
        more Potassium Nitrate.
    c.) To make it burn faster, add
        more Aluminum Dust.

        Rocket Fuel No.2 (high grade)
        ----------------

NOTE: This is the best composition
      for rocket fuel.  It is one
      of the best compositions I have
      ever tried.  Only mercury 
      fulminate was better, and I
      don't care to describe that!

Materials:
----------

1)  Model rocket engine (any engine
    will do, but the bigger ones like
    C or D engines are recommeded).

2)  Hammer 


Procedure:
----------

1)  First, using the hammer, knock
    out the ceramic nozzle of the
    engine.  The color of the nozzle
    is light gray.  

2)  When you start to see black grains
    in the gray of the nozzle powder,
    put the rocket engine in a shoe
    box or something else to catch
    the propellant.  Now hit the 
    engine with the hammer to get the
    propellant out (careful, not too
    hard). 

3)  When all the propellant has been
    removed and is in the shoe box,
    grains will be in size ranging 
    from dust to pieces about 1/2 inch
    in size. You may take out the 
    propellant and use it for 
    whatever you wish.  WARNING: DO
    NOT EVER GRIND THIS MIXTURE!
    It might explode in your face!
    Use it only in the form you got
    it from the engine.  Also, since
    I don't know what model  rocket
    propellant is made out of, I don't
    know how poisonous it is.  As a
    rule, however, do not let it get
    on you and always wash after 
    experiments with it (this is just
    a good procedure for any experi-
    ment dealing with chemicals).
