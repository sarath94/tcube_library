Here's a GREAT little trick to play on your best fiend (no thats not a typo)
at skool, or maybe as a practial joke on a friend!
 
    Materials Needed
    ----------------
 
        1]   One Ball Point `Click` pen
        2]   Gun Powder
        3]   8 or 10 match heads
        4]   1 Match stick
        5]   a little sheet of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")
 
 
      Procedure
      ---------
 
        1]   Unscrew pen and remove all parts but leave the button in the
             top in the pen.
        2]   Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where the 
             other little parts and the ink fill was.
        3]   Roll sand paper up and put around the match stick that is in
             the clicker.
        4]   Put the remaining Match Heads inside the pen, make sure that
             they are on the inside on the sand paper.
        5]   Put a small piece of paper or something in the other end of the
             pen where the ball point comes out. 
        6]   Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gun powder. The 
             paper is to keep the powder from spilling.
        
The Finished pen should look like this:

        \                    |                   |
