Part I.

        Yeah you see alot of files out of there, and they're real great.
Assuming, of course, you have access to a large supply of contraband material.
But I know not all of you out there can get all these Chemicals and explosives
so easy. Which is why this file came to be. Enjoy, but please be careful if you
should decide to actually make this stuff.

Part II.
                                The Pipe Bomb

        The Pipe Bomb is a common tool of the modern anarchist. It is simply a
pipe filled with explosive material and capped at both ends. This is not
something you would use for a high-school prank. This is a deadly weapon, which
if not manufactured with great care, can lead to the destruction of the
creator.

        There are two versions of the Pipe Bomb that seem to be favored by most
anarchists. Match Heads, and Gun Powder. I will describe Both.

-- Match Heads

        This seems to be the more popular version among youths today. This
could be because it is less dangerous and some people enjoy the use of all
their limbs.
        It is created by simply taking a pipe with steel threads on each end
and filling it with match heads. Preferably those that strike on anything (i.e.
jeans, bricks, etc..). Although cutting match heads can be tedious work when
done alone, it can provide an evening of entertainment for the whole family.
        Once you have filled the pipe, carefully cap it on both ends. The
larger your pipe is, the more destructive it is. So plan accordingly. Drill a
hole in one cap and insert the fuse (I suggest something slow burning if
possible) These bombs are destructive and LOUD. If detonated in an enclosed
area, loss of hearing can, and probably will occur.

-- Gun Powder

        Basiclly the same concept, except your pipe is filled with gun powder
instead of match heads. This is more destructive in general, but incredibly
dangerous. Exercise EXTREME caution when screwing the caps on the end. Often
small grains of gun powder will be trapped in the threads, and when the steel
grinds it, well you can guess what happens. I suggest wiping it carefully with
a wet rag before screwing it on.

Part III.
                                Napalm

        Many of you have heard of Napalm and seem to think it is some highly
explosive mixture of chemicals. This is completely false. Napalm is simply one
part soap, one part Gasoline. The Soap must be a shredded bar of soap or soap
bits. Detergents just won't do.

        Take a double boiler and fill the bottom boiler with water. Bring the
water to a boil and then take it to an open space with no flame. Add the
gasoline to the upper boiler and add soap. Stir until this mess thickens.
You now have one of the best fire bombs around. It should be a thick gell-like
substance. It is highly flammable, so don't put it in near a flame unless you
don't like yourself very much.

   Part IV.
                  Household Versions of Usefull Chemicals

        Allright some of you guys out there download textfiles and the find out
you gotta have Plutonium or somethin to make the damn bomb. Well this file
should help you out, giving you household replacements of these chemicals
needed. It's a fairly complete list, so enjoy.

  Part V.
                             The Molotov Cocktail

        Still one of the most usefull devices of the anarchist is the Molotov
Cocktail. These are usually a gasoline filled bottle with a fuel soaked rag
stuffed in the mouth. The Original cocktail, and in my opinion, the best, was a
mixture of 1 part gasoline and 1 part motor oil. The Gasoline is obviously what
catches on fire, and the motor oil helps it to stick to whatever it may
splatter upon. There are, however, other variations on this. One is a mixture
of tar and gasoline. Other Firebombs have been found with Melted wax poured
into a bottle of Gasoline. This is, as you can imagine, quite painful if it
gets on you. Be careful making these. Throw it as soon as you light it, because
you most definately do not want to be holding one of these when it goes off.

   Part VI.
                             The Tennis Ball Bomb

        Another simple-to-make device is the Tennis Ball Bomb. This is
constructed by first taking a simple tennis ball, and drilling a hole in it.
Then get those matches that strike anywhere and cut off the heads, sticking
them in the hole. When the ball is full, give it to your dog. NO just kidding,
I don't like animal cruelty. (Except to kats, but they don't count) Anyways
throw this at something and it won't make a BIG explosion but it will scare
someone.. If you want to increase the size of your explosion/fire, pour
gasoline on it or mix gunpowder in with the matches. Enjoy, this is a pretty
simple/safe one.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   Part VII.
                               The Diskette Bomb

        An excellent method of getting revenge on one of your computer-using
friends is the Diskette Bomb. This is a simple bomb to make, and very safe.

        First, Get a knife and cut open the flap of the disk that is sealed
with glue so you can take out the actual floppy disk.

        Next take a cup and put a little bit of Nail Polish Remover in it.
Then take matches and grind up the heads into the Nail Polish Remover. Keep
doing this until you have a ugly mud-like substance. Take the mudd and rub it
over the floppy disk (the actual disk with the data on it, that you took out
from it's cover. Make sure it doesn't show through any of the holes. Put it
back in and re-seal the disk.

        Now put it between to very heavy books or somethin overnight. When you
get up in the morning you will have a fully functional disk bomb. The grinding
of the heads against the matcheads will cause a spark, lighting the nail polish
remover, and eventually damaging the disk drive.

   Part VIII.
                     The High School Locker Smoke Bomb

        This is a really nice one. Allright here's a list of the materials you
will need for this project.

1) 1 Smoke Bomb (Either Manufactured with fuse or homemade w/ fuse (explained
later))
2) 1 Model Rocket Ignitor. You can get these at your favorite Hobby Store. Even
Toy's R Us. Wow.
3) 1 Battery. Preferably Lantern.
4) 1 Wire
5) 1 Reverse Switch (When deppressed it is off, when up it is on)
6) Two Alligator Clips

                               Alligator Clips = C

                                                  Smoke Bomb



        Ok, Hopefully you'll be able to understand that. What you do is place
the button so it is up against the door and depressed. When the door is opened,
the button goes up, the current is turned on, the Rocket Ignitor Heats up and
lights the fuse, and your smoke bomb is ignited. Voila. If you really hate the
guy, Make the Ignitor light a model rocket engine (out of the rocket) instead of
a Smoke Bomb. Those things go crazy when you just light em. Have fun with this
one.

   Part IX.
                                The Smoke Bomb

        Allright, this will tell you how to make a basic smoke bomb. It's
pretty simple, and incredibly safe.

        Mix 4 parts sugar with 6 parts potassium Nitrate (Salt Peter) and melt
it under a low flame and stir the gook. Before it hardens up put a few match
heads in it for fuses (aren't match heads great?)

        One Pound will supposedly fill an entire block with white Smoke. Nice.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   Part X.
                                The Bottle Bomb

        This is an easy bomb to make, and a highly used/effective one.  What
you need:

1) Glass Bottle
2) Gasoline
3) Potassium Permangante

        Take your glass bottle and put a few drops of gasoline in it. Now cap
off the bottle and roll it around so the gas evaporates on the sides.. Now add
a few drops of the Potassium Permangante (when I say a few, I mean like three
or four, for both the gas and PP) This Bomb can be detonated simply by throwing
it at a solid object (ie. a wall, a car, a teacher's head etc..)
Simple, eh?

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

        Well That about does it for this Edition. I may make another one with
more complex explosives ie. Nitro, Car Bombs, Etc.. We'll have to see. Look for
PHA Newsletter #2 Coming sometime in the Beginning of Summer '90.
Be Careful with this shit. I don't want you going around killing anyone.
(except cats). Have fun with it, set a dummy on fire or something.. If you
wanna kill someone, buy a fucking gun you jew. It's a hell of a lot simpler
and it has a much higher success rate. Plus you can't blame it on me. If you
get caught with some of this stuff, say you got it from Playing heavy metal
lyrics backwards. They eat that stuff up.
