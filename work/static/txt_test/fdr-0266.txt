Opening:  Greetings!  Welcome to my first major production.  What the hell is
this guy babbling about "black books"?  Well, in the 60's a special forces
program was developed at the Frankford arsenal to develop and test improvised
explosives.  What you see here are the results of these tests.  Typed directly
from Army TM 31-210 and Desert Publication's Black Book Vol. III.  


Disclaimer: I take absolutely no responsibility for the use of this material,
whether it be direct or indirect.  What I have done here is simply provide this
information for one purpose only (har har) and that is for informational
purposes only.  All information here, however, should be taken as seriously as
the bible. You can very easily fuck up and get killed.  Please be very, very
careful (shit, i sound like your mother) when dealing with any of the items
presented here.  Note especially the section on improvised pistols.      


                                                thanx. and by god...

1.  Spread potassium chlorate crystals thinly on a hard surface.  Roll the
    round stick over crystals to crush into a very fine powder or wheat flower.

2.  Place 9 parts powdered potassium chlorate and 1 part petroleum jelly
    in a wide bowl or similar container.  Mix ingredients with hands 
    until a uniform paste is obtained.

Note: Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.


                                                            
Potassium Nitrate                                           Sec. I, No. 2

Potassium nitrate can be extracted from many natural sources and can be used to
make nitric acid, black powder and many pyrotechnics.  The yield ranges from .1
to 10% by weight, depending on the fertility of the soil.

punching tool

alcohol - 1 gallon (4 l) can be whiskey,
rubbing, etc.

heat source

paper

tape   

Note: Only the ratios of the amounts of ingredients are important.  Thus, for
twice as much, double all quantities.


Procedure
---------

1.  Punch holes in bottom of bucket.  Spread one piece of cloth over holes 
    inside bucket.

2.  Place wood ashes on cloth and spread to make a layer about the thickness of
    the cloth.  Place second piece of cloth on top of ashes.

3.  Place dirt in bucket.

4.  Place bucket over shallow container.  Bucket may be supported on sticks if
    necessary.

5.  Boil water and pour it over earth in bucket a little at a time.  Allow
    water to run through holes in bucket into shallow container.  Be sure water
    goes through all the earth.  Allow drained liquid to cool and settle for 1
    to 2 hours.

Note: Do not pour all the water at once, as this may cause stoppage.

6.  Carefully drain off liquid into heat resistant container.  Discard any 
    sludge remaining in bottom of the shallow container.

7.  Boil mixture over hot fire for at least 2 hours.  Small grains of salt will
    begin to appear in the solution.  Scoop these out as they form, using any 
    type of improvised strainer (paper, etc)

8.  When liquid has boilded down to approx. half its original volume, remove
    from fire and let sit.  After half an hour, add an equal volume of alcohol.
    When mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals will collect on
    top of it.

9.  To purify the potassium nitrate, re-dissolve the dry crystals in the 
    smallest possible amount of boiled water.  Remove any salt crystals that
    appear (step 7); pour through an improvised filter made of several pieces
    of paper and evaporate of gently heat the concentrated solution to dryness.

10. Spread crystals on plat surface and allow to dry.  The crystals are now 
    ready to use.

Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups (.5 l)

Sulfur, powdered, .5 cup (1/8 l)

Alcohol, 5 pints (2.5 l) whiskey, rubbing, etc.

water 3 cups, (.75 l)

heat source

2 buckets- each 2 gallon (7.5 l) cap., one of
which must be heat resistant (metal, ceramic)

Flat window screen 1 foot square

large wooden stick

cloth, 2 ft. sq.


Procedure
---------

1.  Place alcohol in one of the buckets.

2.  Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant bucket.
    Add 1 cups water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all ingredients
    are dissolved.

3.  Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture.  Place bucket on heat source and 
    stir until small bubbles begin to form.

Note: Do NOT boil mixture.  Be sure all mixture stays wet.  If any is dry, as on sides of pan, it maignite.

4.  Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
    vigorously.

5.  Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes.  Strain mixture through cloth to
    obtain black powder.  Discard liquid.  Wrap cloth around black powder and
    squeeze to remove all excess liquid.

6.  Place screening over dry bucket.  Place workable amount of damp powder on
    screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen.

Note: If granulated particles appear to stick together and change shape,
recombine entire batch of powder and repeat steps 5 and 6.  

7.  Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about .5" (1.25
    cm) is formed.  Allow to dry.  Use radiator, or direct sunlight.  This 
    should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in one hour.  The longer 
    the drying period, the less effective the black powder. 

Note: Remove from here as soon as granules are dry.  Black powder is now ready
for use.



                                                            
Nitric Acid                                                 Sec. I, No. 4

Nitric acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incendiary mixtures
and acid delay timers.  It may be prepared by distilling a mixture of potassium
nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.

Materials                                       Sources
---------                                       -------

Potassium nitrate (2 parts by volume)           Drug store, improvised, (Sec. I
                                                No. 2)                   

Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 part by vol)      motor vehicle batteries,
                                                industrial plants

2 bottles or ceramic jugs (narrow necks
preferable)

pot or frying pan

Heat source

Tape (paper, electrical, not cellophane)

Paper or rags 

Note: If sulfuric acid is obtained from motor vehicles, it must be concentrated
by boiling until white fumes appear.  Do NOT inhale fumes.  Also, the amount of
nitric acid produced is the same as the amount of potassium nitrate used, so 
for 2 tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2 tablespoons potassium nitrate and 1
tablespoon sulfuric acid.

Procedure
---------

1.  Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug.  Add sulfuric acid.  Do not 
    fill more than 1/4 full  Mix until a paste is formed.

Note: Treat sulfuric acid like any other acid, wash affected skin with water,  
and dont inhale the fucking fumes.

2.  Wrap paper or rags around necks of 2 bottles.  Securly tape necks of 
    bottles together.  Be sure bottles are flush against each other and that 
    there are no air spaces.

3.  Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is slightly lower 
    than bottle sontaining paste so that nitric acid is formed in receiving 
    bottle will not run into other bottle.

4.  Build fire in pot or frying pan.

5.  Gently heat bottle containing mixture by moving fire in and out.  As
    red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cold water over empty receiving
    bottle.  Nitric acid will begin to form in the receiving bottle.

Note: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter.  As
an added protection, place bottle to be hated in a heat resistant container
filled with sand or gravel.  Hear this outer container to produce nitric acid.

6.  Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed.  If the
    nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it
    into cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.

Note:  Do not inhale fumes, and nitric acid should be stored in a sealed glass 
or ceramic container.




Initiator for dust explosions                               Sec I, No. 5

An initiator which will initiate common material to produce dust explosions can
be rapidly and easily constructed.  This type of charge is ideal for the
destruction of enclosed areas such as rooms or buildings.

Materials                                       Sources     
---------                                       -------

a flat can, 3 in. (8 cm) in diameter and
1-1.5 in. (3-3.75 cm) in height.  A 6.5 oz.
Tuna can serves the purpose quite well

blasting cap

explosive

aluminum (may be wire, cust sheet, flat can,
or powder)

large nail, 4 in. (10 cm) long

wooden rod, .25 in. (6 mm) in diameter

flour, gasoline, and powder or chipped aluminum

Note: Plastic explosives (comp. C4, etc.) produce larger explosions that cast
explosives (comp. B, etc).


Procedure
---------

1.  Using the nail, press a hole through the side of the Tuna can 3/8 to 1/2 
    in. (1-1.5 cm) from the bottom.  Using a rotating a lever action, enlarge 
    the hole until it will accomodate the blasting cap.

2.  Place the wodden rod in the hole and position the end of the rod at the 
    center of the can.

3.  Press explosive into the can, being sure to surround the rod, until it is
    3/4 in. (2 cm) from top of the can.  Carefully remove the wooden rod.

4.  Place the aliminum metal on top of the explosive.

5.  Just before use, insert the blasting cap into the cavity made by the
    rod.  The initiator is now ready for use.

Note: If it is desired to carry the initiator some distance, cardboard may be
pressed on top of the aluminum to insure against loss of material.


How to Use
----------

This particular unit works quite well to initiate charges of five pounds of
flour, 1/2 gallon (1 2/3 l) of gasoline or two pounds of flake painters
aluminum.  The solid materials may merely be contained in sacks or cardboard
cartons.  The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated paper milk cartons,
plastic or glass bottles.  The charges are placed directly on top of the
initiator and the blasting cap is actuated electrically or by fuse depending on
the type of cap used.  This will destroy a 2,000 cubic feet enclosure (building
10x20x10 feet)

Note: For larger enclosures, use proportionally larger initiators ad charges.

Fuel oil or gasoline and motor oil (1:1)        cars, trucks

Two flat boards, One which can be 
comfortably held in the hand, i.e., 2"x4",
and 36"x36" 
    
Bucket or other container for mixing items

Iron or steel pipe or bottle, tin can or heavy
walled cardboard tube

blasting cap

wooden rod, 1/4" in. diameter

spoon or similar measuring container


Procedure
---------

1.  Spread a hadful of the ammonium nitrate (an) on the large flat board and
    rub vigorously with the other board until the large particles are crushed
    into a very fine powder that looks like flour (approx. 10 min. per handful)

Note: Continue with step 2 as soon as possible, since the powder may take
moisture from the air and become spoiled.

2.  Mix on measure (cup, tablespoon, etc) of fuel oil with 16 measures of the 
    finely ground AN in a dry bucket or other suitable container and stir with
    the wooden rod.  If fuel oil is not available, use one half measure of 
    motor oil.  Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.

3.  Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has and end cap 
    threaded on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin 
    can, a glass jar or a heavy-walled cardboard tube.

Note:  Take care not to tamp or shake the mixture in the pipe.  If mixture
becomes tightly packed, one cap will not be sufficient to initiate the
explosive.

4.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the open end of the container will add to the effectiveness of
the explosive.


Carbon Tet Explosive                                        Sec. I, No. 7

A moist explosive can be made from fine aluminum powder combined with carbon

clear water- 3.5 cups  
        

Procedure
---------

1.  Place the sugar, potassium nitrate (pn), and water in the bucket.  Heat 
    with a low flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and PN dissolve.

2.  If available, add the ferric oxide (rust) to the solution.  Increase the 
    flame under the mixture until it boils gently.

Note: The mixture will retain the rust coloration.

3.  Stro and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture is 
    reduced to one quarter its original volume, then stir continuously.

4.  As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker until it reaches
    the consistency of cooked breakfast cereal (yum!) or homemade fudge.  At
    this stage of thickness, remove the bucket from the hear source and spread
    the mass on the metal sheet.

5.  While the material cools, score it with the spoon or spatula in 
    crisscrossedfurrows about 1 inch apart.

6.  Allow the material to air dry, preferably in the sun.  As it dries, rescore
    it occasionally (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.

7.  When the material has dried to a point to where it is moist and soft
    but not sticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the screen.  Rub
    the aterial back and forth against the screen mesh with a spoon or other 
    flat object until the material is granulated into small worm-like 
    particles.

8.  After granulation, return the material to the sun to dry completely.

Procedure
---------

1.  Add 24 teaspoons of sulfuric acid to 16.5 teaspoons of nitric acid in the
    2 qt. jar.

2.  Place the jar in the pan (3-5 gallon) filled with cold water or in a stream
    and allow to cool.

3.  Rapidly swirl the jar to create a whirlpool in the liquid (without 
    splashing) while keeping the bottom portion of the jar in the water.

4.  While continually swirling, add to mixture, .5 teaspoon at a time, 13.5
    teaspoons of methyl alcohol, allowing the mixture to cool at least one
    minute between additions.

DANGER! PELIGRO!- If there is a sudden increase in the amount of fumes produced
of if the solution turns much darker or begins to froth, dump the solution in
the water within 10 seconds!  This will help lengthen your life, and prevent an
accident.

5.  After the final addition of methyl alcohol, swirl for another 35-40 
    seconds.

6.  Carefully pour the solution into one of the narrow glass jars.  Allow jar
    to stand in water for approx. 5 minutes until two layers separate.

7.  With an eyedropper or styringe, remove top layer and CAREFULLY put into 
    another narrow glass jar.  This liquid is the explosve.

Note: Thought I should tell you, this is shock sensitive. (very)

8.  Add an equal quantity of water to the explosive and swirl.  Allow mixture
    to separate again as in step 6.  The explosive is now the bottom layer.

9.  Carefully remove the top layer with the eyedropper or styringe and 
    discard.

10. Place one firmly packed cup of absorbent in the tray. 

11. While stirring with the wooden stick, slowly add explosive until the mass
    is very damp but not wet enough to drip.  Explosive is ready to use.

Note: If it gets too wet, add more absorbent.  If storage is required, store in
a sealed container to prevent evaporation.  Do not allow this to touch the 
skin.  If it does, flush with large quantities of water.  Keep grit, dirt, and
sand out of the mix.


How to Use
----------

1.  Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap 
    threaded on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin
    can or a glass jar.

2.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surfacr of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the other end will add to the effectivenessof the explosive.

Procedure
---------

1.  Dilute 5 teaspoons of nitric acid with 2.5 teaspoons of clean water in a
    glass container by adding the acid to the water.

2.  Dissolve 1/8 teaspoon of mercury in the diluted nitric acid.  This will
    yield dark red fumes.

Note:  It may be necessary to add water, one drop at a time, to the 
mercury-acid solution in order to start reaction.  Also take usual precautions
when handling acid.

3.  Warm 10 teaspoons of the alcohol in a container until the alcohol feels 
    warm to the inside of the wrist.

4.  Pour the metal-acid solution into the warm alcohol.  Reaction should start
    in less than 5 minutes.  Dense white fumes will be given off during
    reaction.  As time lapses, the fumes will become less dense.  Allow 10
    to 15 minutes to complete reaction.  Fulminate will settle to bottom.

Note: This reaction generates large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes.  The
process must be conducted outdoors or in a well ventilated area, away from
sparks or flames.  Do not inhlale fumes unless you like death.

5.  Filter the solution through a paper towel into a container.  Crystals may
    stick to the side of the container.  If so, tilt and squirt water down the 
    sides of the container until all the material collects on the filter paper.

6.  Wash the crystals with 6 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol.

7.  Allow these to dry.

Note: Handle dry explosives with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it
roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool dry place.

2.  Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture by placing its container in a larger one
    containing a mixture of ice, salt and water.

Note: Because of the lighter inner container being buoyant in the larger outer
container, it is necessary to secure it so that it will not fall over into the
ice, salt, and water mixture.  

3.  Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture to 5 degrees C.

4.  Add 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the acetone/peroxide mixture 
    slowly. drop by drop, with the use of an eye dropper.  Stir the mixture  
    during the addition of the sulfuric acid with a thermometer, keeping the 
    temperature between 5-10 degrees C., stop adding the sulfuric acid and    
    continue stirring until the temp. drops again to 5 degrees C., then
    continue adding the sulfuric acid.

5.  After all the sulfuric acid has been added, continue stirring the mixture 
    for another five minutes.

6.  Let the acetone/peroxide/sulfuric acid mixture stand in the ice/water/salt
    bath or remove the inner container and place it in an ice box for 12-24
    hours.

7.  After 12 hours, white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of 
    the once clear solution.  Precipitation should be completed after 24 hrs.

Note: At this point the mixture is a primary explosive.  Keep away from shock,
friction and flame.

8.  Filter the mixture through a paper twoel into a container to collect all
    of the solid particles.

9.  Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with small amounts 
    of ice cold water poured over them.  Discard the liquid in the container.

10. Place these explosive crystals in a container and allow to dry.

Note: Handle the dry explosive with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it
roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool, dark, dry
place.

How to Use
----------

Acetone peroxide is a powerful initiator and can be used by itself as the main
filler when making homeade detonators.  Using 2.5" lengths of brass or copper
tubing with one end sealed shit with either solder or epoxy resin, begin by
partiallly filling the tube with acetone perroxide and compressing with a
loading press (Sec. VI, No. 13, Vol. 2 and Sec. II, No. 12, Vol 3).  Continue
This process until the explosive is within 1/2" of the top.  Cap the open end
tightly with a cork or wood stopper.  When ready to use, remove stopper and
insert time fuse.  Seal around fuse and tube insert into the main charge to a
depth of 2".  The caps will detonate most of the explosives shown in this
volume.

Note: These detonators should be used withing 7 days of thier manufacture and
should be stored in a cool, dry place.            



                                                            
Bullseye (low-high) Explosive                               Sec. I, No. 27

A highly effective and powerful low - high explosive can be obtained by simply
using a fast burning double-based, smokeless pistol powder called Bullseye. 
This propellant is used to reload pistol and revolver cartridges and contains a
sensitive mixture of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose.

                                                fine National Guard bases

How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a low explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end caps
    and ignite with a time fuse.  When ignited, the pipe will explode into many
    fragments traveling at a velocity of approximately 600 fps.

2.  To use as a high explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end 
    caps, insert a compound detonator with a fuzing mechanism and detonate.
    When detonated, the pipe will fragment into many small fragments traveling
    at a velocity in excess of 20,000 fps.

Note: Because of the unique mixture of nitroglycering with nitrocellulose
(double-base), Bullseye is one of the few propellants that can be detonated 
with a blasting cap.  When detonated, it is a powerful as military TNT and
should be used to defeat hard targets.

Potassium chlorate/Notrobenzene Explosive               Sec. I, No. 32

A moise explosive can be made from solid potassium chlorate and liquid
nitrobenzene.  This explosive has medium to high power and brisance.  It can be
used as a substitute for 50% ditching dynamite or flake TNT.  This exlosive can
be readily detonated by a standard blasting cap (No. 6).

Two flat boards (from No. 31)  

Blasting cap (No. 6)


Procedure
---------

1.  Use step one from No. 31 to pulverize the potassium chlorate.

Note: Nitrobenzene is extremely toxic and should be handled in well ventilated
areas.  Harmful effects may result from swallowing, inhalation of vapors, or
contact with the skin or eyes.  In case of accidental spilling, wash the
addected area immediately with large quantities of water.

2.  To produce the explosive, all that is required is to pour 1 part by volume,
    20% by weight of nitrobenzene into 4 parts by volume, 80% by weight, of 
    powdered potassium chlorate.  Stir until completely mixed, then store
    in a sealed container wintil ready for use.

3.  Another effective method in producing the explosive is to tightly pre-pack
    a selected charge container with powdered potassium chlorate.  When 
    ready for use, simply pour the pre-measured amount of nitrobenzene into the
    potassium chlorate and allow to soak for 3 to 3 minutes before using.

Note: An important factor to observe when pouring the nitrobenzene into the
potassium chlorate is to not allow the potassium chlorate to be disturbed after
it has been soaked with nitrobenzene.  Whenever a liquid is poured into a
powdered substance, a natural "caking action" will result, producing a fairly
uniform density throughout the solid material.  Since uniform density has a
direct overall effect on the explosive performance, it is important to first
pre-pack a rigid container with the potassium chlorate and then pour in the
nitrobenzene and allow it to soak in without stirring.  This will produce a 
high performance explosive.  Mixing in a plastic bag will produce a low
performance exlosive. 
    

How to Use
----------

1.  This mixture forms a very powerful explosive that can be used for general
    purpose blasting and ditching operations.  It is extremely sensitive to
    detonation and can be initiated by simple homemade detonators.

    or 2 parts by weight of nitromethane into 3 parts by volume or 5 parts by
    weight of powdered ammonium nitrate.  Stir until completely mixed, then
    store in a sealed container until ready to use.

3.  Another effective method in producing the explosive is to tightly pre-pack
    a selected charge container with powdered ammonium nitrate.  When ready
    to use, simply pour the pre-measured amount of nitromethane into the
    ammonium nitrate and allow to soak in for 3 to 5 minutes before using.

Note: An important factor to observe when pouring the nitromethane into the
ammonium nitrate is to not allow the ammonium nitrate to be disturbed after it
has been soaked with nitromethane.  Whenever a liquid is poured into a powdered
substance, a natural "caking action" will result, producing a fairly uniform
density throughout the solid material.  Since uniform density has a direct
overall effect of the explosive performance, it is important to first pre-pack 
a rigid container with ammonium nitrate and then pour in the nitromethane and
allow to soak without stirring.  This will produce a high performance 
explosive.  Mixing in a plastic bag will produce a low performance explosive.


How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive is one of the most powerful/brisant two component explosives
    readily available.  Each component is perfectly safe to handle by itself.
    However, when the two are mixed together, they form a sensitive high 
    explosive that can be detonated with a standard blasting cap.

2.  This explosive mixture should be used to defeat hard targets, such as steel
    and reinforced concrete.  It can also be used with special charges that
    require high brisance, i.e., shaped charges, platter charges, and SCIMP
    charges.




Nitromethane Liquid explosive                               Sec. I, No. 35

A liquid explosive, that resembles water in appearance, can be made from
nitromethane and aqueous ammonia (household glass cleaner).  This exposive is 
22 to 24 more powerful that military TNT and can be detonated with a standard
blasting cap.  However, to achieve maximum velocity, a compound detonator 
should be used.

Procedure
---------

Note: Nitromethane is a common chemical reagent, and under normal conditions
cannot be made to detonate even if a strong detonator is used.  However, if
certain ammonia-containing compounds (called sensitizers) are alled in small
percentages (5-6 %), then the sensitized nitromethane can be detonated with a
standard #8 blasting cap.  The most effective sensitizers are aniline and
ethylenediamine.  The most readily available sensitizer is common household
glass cleaner (aqueous ammonia).

1.  To produce the explosive, simply pour the sensitizer into the nitromethane
    and mix thoroughly.  One-half pic sensitizer will sensitize one gallon of
    nitromethane.

2.  The explosive can be premixed, or for safety's sake, it can be mixed just
    prior to use by prefilling a charge container with nitromethane and then 
    adding the sensitizer when ready to detonate.


How to Use
----------

1.  This liquid explosive can be used whenever or wherever a liquid can be 
    used for disguiseability.  It can be poured directly into prefabricated
    special charge containers, i.e., shape charges, platter charges, and SCIMP
    charges, without special measures being taken to maintain uniform densities
    required for solid explosives to be effective.

2.  To obtain the maximum efficiency, a compound detonator should be used for 
    initiation.  Reliability of initiation is increased by positioning and 
    immersing the detonator centrally with respect to the wall of the
    container.  By centrally positioning and immersing the detonator in the
    liquid, the output energy of the detonator is transmitted to the 
    explosive instead of being partially dissipated through the wall of the
    container.

Fertilizer/hydrazine liquid explosive                       Sec. I, No. 36

A liquid explosive can be made from solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer combined
with liquid anhydrous hydrazine.  This liquid explosive is more powerful and
brisant than C4 plastic explosive and can be used as a direct replacement for
C4.  This explosive can be detonated with a blasting cap.  However, to achieve
maximum velocity a compound detonator should be used.

Procedure
---------

Note:  Anhydrous hydrazine is classified as as corrosive and is flammable. 
Keep away from spark or flame.  It is also mildly toxic and should be handled 
in well ventilated areas.  Affected areas of skin should be washed with large
quantities of water.

1.  Pour into the mixing container an amount of anhydrous hydrazine equal to 
    the amount of explosive required.

2.  Ammonium nitrate (prilled or powdered) is then added, a teaspoon at a
    time, to the hydrazine in the mixing container.

Note: The mixing container should be fairly large (5x the volume of the
hydrazine) because the chemical reaction between the ammonium nitrate and the
hydrazine is extremely effervescent and can easily bubble over the top.

3.  Because of the effervescent reaction, the ammonium nitrate should be added
    very slowly so as not to create accidental over-flowing.  With each 
    addition of ammonium nitrate, the person doing the mixing should wait for
    the initial reaction to subside, then stir the solution until all of the
    ammonium nitrate dissolves into it.

Note: The reaction between the ammonium nitrate and hydrazine liberates large
volumes of poisonous gas.  The person doing the mixing should be upwind of the
mixing process so as not to breath the poisonous fumes.

4.  The  mixing process is continued until the ammonium nitrate no longer 
    dissolves into the solution, even after five minutes of stirring, and a 
    small amount reamains undissolved at the bottom of the mixing container.
    This undissolved ammonium nitrate does not affect the performance of the
    explosive.

5.  After the mixing process is complete, what will remain will be a clear
    liquid explosive more powerful and brisant that any military explosive.

Note: The mixed explosive has a lower toxicity of the hydrazine.  However, it 
is recommended that the same handling precautions be observed.

6.  To make an even more powerful explosive, 20% aluminum powder (100 mesh or
    finer) can be added to the ammonium nitrate  before mixing with the 
    hydrazine (it does not react with the other two ingredients), or ir can
    be added after the mixing process is complete. 

How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive is the most powerful/brisant of the two complement explosive
    systems available.  It can be used whenever or wherever a liquid can be 
    used for disguiseability.

2.  It can be poured directly into prefabricated special charge containers,
    i.e., shape, platter and SCIMP charges, without special measures being
    taken to maintain uniform densities required by solid explosives to be
    effective.

3.  It has unique absorption and retention poperties which can be used to
    create a liquid land mine.  The liquid explosive can be poured directly
    into the ground, soaking into and blending with the surrounding earth.
    The pocket of explosive can be initiated by a conventional electrically
    or mechanically actuated detonator.  These pockets of explosives have 
    remained detonable for four days in the ground, even when the soil was
    soaked due to rainy weather.

Explosive paper                                             Sec I, No. 37

An excellent absorption explosive can be made from a solution of PETN (the
center filler of detonator cord), acetone, and mineral oil.  When any non-gloss
paper, i.e., newspaper, paperback books, corrugated cardboard, etc., is dipped
in this explosive solution and then removed and allowed to dry, the paper will
retain its original texture and appearance along with a microcrystaline high
explosive incorporated into the fiber content of the paper.  This produces a
disguised explosive that can be carried into a target area without arousing
suspicion.

Procedure
---------

1.  Using a razor blade, cut detonating cord lengthwise and remove the center
    filler (P.E.T.N.).  Approx. .5 lb. of PETN can be removed per 100 ft. 
    of detonating cord.

2.  Fill a canning jar 2/3 full of acetone and heat until mildly warm by 
    placing the canning jar in a pan or bucket on heat source when it contains 
    the canning jar.

3.  Add PETN to the acetone, a tablespoon a a time, while stirring with a 
    stirring rod.  Stir the solution until the PETN dissolves.  Add more PETN
    until it no longer dissolves into solution, even after five minutes of 
    stirring.  Approx. 1/3 lb. of PETN will dissolve in every lb. of warm
    acetone used.

4.  Approx. 2% mineral should be added to the final solution.  This mineral
    oil will prevent the crystals of PETN from recrystalizing to a noticeable
    size when the acetone evaporates.  The mineral oil will also provide a 
    better texture to the paper when it is dry after the soaking process.

5.  Pout this solution into a large, flat pam, then fill the pan with even
    sheets of a non gloss paper.  It rolled newspaper is used, unroll it and
    lay it out evenly in the an.  Allow the paper to soak for 30 minutes.

6.  After soaking for 30 minutes, remove the paper and allow to dry for at 
    least 24 hours.  DO NOT DRY IN AN OVEN.  After the papr has had time to 
    dry, 50 % of its weight will consist of a microcrystaline high explosive
    intimately incorporated into the fiber content of the paper.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use simply insert a blasting cap ot compound detonator into the paper
    and detonate.

2.  If a rolled newspaper is used, the detonator and fusing mechanism  can
    be concealed in the center of the roll and easily carried into the 
    target area and left where destruction is desired.  An average size 
    newspaper has the explosive equivalent of several sticks of dynamite.

Procedure
---------


1.  Place .5 cup, 120 ml or cc of nitrix acid in a large canning jar and bring
    the temperature to between 20 and 30 degrees C. (68-86 F)  By putting the
    jar in a basin of cold water.  If necessary, swirl the canning jar around
    the basin of cold water to bring the temperature down, while being careful
    not to allow any water to splash into the acid.

Note:  Maintain the thermometer in the acid throughout the reaction while
carefully noting and controlling the temperature by alternating the jar between
the basin of cold water and the basin of hot water.  The thermometer can be 
used as a stirring rod if the solution is gently stirred.

2.  Weigh or measure out 70 grams by weight, 18 teaspoons by volume, of the 
    hexamine and start adding the salt-like hexamine slowly, 1/2 teaspoon
    at a time, during a 15 minute period.  Maintain the temp. between 20 - 30
    degrees C, while stirring gently with the thermometer.  Control the temp.
    by dipping the canning jar in and out of the basin filled with cold water.

3.  When all of the hexamine is dissolved in the acid, heat the solution to
    55 degrees C, by placing the canning jar in a bsin of hot water.  Maintain
    tis temperature for about 10 minutes.

4.  After heating the solution for 10 minutes, remove the canning jar from
    the basin of cold water and place it in the basin of cold water.  Cool the
    canning jar to 20 degrees C. (68 degrees F).

5.  When the temperature has reached 20 degrees C, add 3 cups (750 ml) of
    cold water to the solution and a white salt will appear.

Note:  The white salt is RDX and should be handled with great care from now on.

6.  Filter the acid/water/RDX solution through a paper towel covering the
    mouth of another jar.

7.  Wash the RDX crystals off the paper towel and into a canning jar, using
    an additional 3 cups of fresh, cold water.  Add a teaspoon of sodium 
    carbonate to neutralize the acid and stir rapidly for 2-3 minutes, then
    filter again.

8.  The crude product can be dried out on the paper towel filter.  It is 
    suitable for fairly immediate use, or it can be purified.

9.  To purify RDX, fill a quart canning jar 2/3 full of acetone.  Heat the
    acetone by placing the jar in a basin of hot simmering water, then add
    RDX, a tablespoon at a time, until it completely dissolves in the 
    acetone.

10. After the maximem amount of RDX has been dissolved into the hot acetone,
    allow the solution to cool to room temperature, then let stand for one
    more hour.

11. The RDX will form a salt once again.  Filter the RDX and spread it out on
    a paper towel as before.

12. The purified RDX should be stored in a clean canning jar with a tight
    fitting lid.  It can be stored for months without loss of effectiveness.

Note: RDX is not too sensitive to heat and shock, but is fairly sensitive to
friction.  Care should therefore be taken when the explosive is to be packed or
when the dry explosive is handled.  Using the amounts of chemicals listed in
this article, the yield of RDX should be about 1/5 oz.





Explosive Flour                                             Sec. I, No. 39

An explosive that looks and bakes like ordinary wheat flour can be made from a
mixture flour and RDX.  It can be used in many different forms as an explosive:
in its dry powder form, moistened with water and used as a dough like plastic
explosive, or by using special recipes it can be baked into pancakes or 
bisuits.

large sheet of wood, and a rolling pin
(wood must be flat)


Procedure
---------

1.  Place a tablespoonful of RDX crystals on the large sheet of wood.  Using
    a rolling pic, crush the crystals into a fine powder, the consistency of
    flour.

Note:  Use only a rolling pic, not a block of wood.  It is important to crush
the RDX crystals into a fine powder rather than using friction between to
rubbing surfaces.

2.  Mix 80% by weight of powdered RDX with 20% by weight of flour in a canning
    jar with a tight fitting lid by shaking for five minutes.

3.  The mixed explosive flour can be stored in the sealed mixing conainer for
    long periods of time before using.  It can also be disguised by storing
    it in an original bag of flour.


How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive flour is more powerful and brisant that military TNT and
    is easiest to detonate in its powdered form.  A standard blasting cap 
    provides sufficient shock to set it off.

2.  To use as a plastic explosive, mix 4 parts by weight of flour to 1 part
    by weight of water.  This forms a dough that has very desirable plastic 
    qualities which can be used to mold itself around vertain types of
    targets in the same manner as military C4 plastic explosive.  A compound
    detonator must be use to insure positive detonation.

3.  The following recipes make it possible to bake the powdered explosive into
    pancakes or biscuits:

    A.  For pancakes, use this recipe:

        3 cups explosive flour
        2 teaspoons of baking powder
       .5 teaspoon of salt
        1 cup of milk
        1 egg
        2 tablespoons of melted lard

Note: This pancake mixture can be left of the griddle until it completely chars
with no unusual effects,  thus demonstrating the stability of the mixture to
heat.

    B.  For explosive biscuits, use this recipe:

        3 cups explosive flour
        2 teaspoons of baking powder
      3/8 teaspoon of salt
        2 teaspoons of lard
       88 ml or cc of water

4.  The finished pancakes and biscuits look, feel, and taste like ordinary
    pancakes and biscuits.  However, they are highly toxic, and SHOULD NOT
    BE EATEN.  Before using these baked items as an explosive, they must be 
    moistened and kneaded into a plastic masss to remove the air spaces.  
    They may be exploded in the same manner as the plastic form.                                                                                    
Pipe Hand Grenade                                           Sec. II, No. I

Hand grenades can be made from a piece of iron pipe.  The filler can be plastic
or granular military explosive, improvised explosive, or propellant from
shotgunn or small arms ammunition.

Procedure
---------

1.  Place blasting cap on one end of fuse cord and crimp with pliers. 
    

Note:  To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it takes 
for a known length of fuse to burn.  If 12 inches burns in 30 seconds, a six
inch cord will ignite the grenade in 15 seconds.

2.  Screw pipe cap to one end of pipe.  Place fuse cord with blasting cap into
    the opposite end so that the blasting cap is near the center of the pipe.

Note:  If plastic explosive is to be used, fill pipe before inserting blasting
cap.  Push a round stick into the center of the exlosive to make a hole and 
then insert blasting cap.

3.  Pour exlposive or propellant into pipe a little at a time.  Tap the base 
    of the pipe frequently to settle filter.

4.  Drill a hole in the center of the unassembled pipe cap large enough
    for the fuse cord to pass through.

5.  Wipe pipe threads to remove any filler material.  Slide the drilled pipe
    cap over the fuse and screw handtight onto pipe.

tap, string, wire or glue


Procedure
---------

1.  If an explosive charge other than a standard TNT block is used, make
    a hole in the center of the charge for inserting the blasting cap.  TNT
    can be drilled with relative safety.  With plastic explosives, a hole can
    be made by pressing a round stick into the center of the charge.  The hole
    should be deep enough that the blasting cap is totally within the
    explosive.

2.  Tape, tie or glue on or two rows of closely packed nails to sides of 
    explosive block.  Nails should completely cover the four surfaces of the 
    block. 

3.  Place blasting cap on one end of the fuse cord and crimp with pliers.

Note: Use same method in Sec. II, No. 1 to determine burning lengths of fuse.

4.  Insert the blasting cap in the hole in the block of explosive.  Tape or tie
    fuse cord securly in place so that it will not fall out when the grenade 
    is thrown.


Alternate Use
-------------

An effective directional anti-personnel mine can be made by placing nails on
only one side of the explosive block.  For this case, an electric blasting cap
should be used.

Procedure
---------

1.  Soak a piece of string in gasoline or kerosene.  Double wrap this
    string around the wine bottle approx. 3 in. above the top of the cone.

Note: Adding a small amount of motor oil to the gasoline or kerosene will
improve results.

2.  Ignite the string and allow to burn for 1 to 2 minutes.  Then plunge the

    and discarded.

3.  If plastic explosive is used:

    A.  Pack explosive into the bottle a little at a time compressing with
        a wooden rod.  Fill the bottle up to the top.

    B.  Press a .25 in. wooden dowel .5 in into the middle of the top of 
        the explosive charge to form a hole for the blasting cap.

4.  If TNT or other castable explosive is used:

    A.  Break explosive into small pieces using a wooden mallet or non-
        sparking metal tools.  Place pieces in a tin can.    
                                               
    B.  Suspend this can in a larger container which is partly filled with
        water.  A stiff wire or stick pushed through the smaller can will
        accomplish this.

Note:  The inner can must not rest on the bottom of the outer container.

    C.  Heat the containr on a electric hot plate or other heat source.  Stir
        the explosive frequently with a wooden stick while it is melting.

Note: Keep area well ventilated while melting explosive.  Fumes may be
poisonous.

    D.  When all the explosive has melted, remove the inner container and 
        stir the molten explosive until it begins to thicken.  Diring this
        time the bottom half of the wine bottle should be placed in the
        container of hot water.  This will pre-heat the bottle so that it
        will not crack whenthe explosive is poured.

    E.  Remove the bottle from how water and dry thoroughly.  Pour molten
        explosive into the bottle and allow to cool.  The crust which
        forms on top of the charge during cooling should be broken with a
        wooden stick and more explosive added.  Do this as often as necessary 
        until the bottle is filled to the top.

    F.  When explosive has completely hardened, bore a hole for the blasting
        cap in the middle of the top of the charge about .5 in. deep.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place blasting cap in the hole in the top of the charge.  If non-electric
    blasting cap is used, be sure cap is crimped around fuze and fuze is 
    long enough to provide safe delay.

2.  Place the charge so that the bottom is 3-4 in. from the target.  This can
    be done by taping legs to the charge or any other convenient means as 
    long as there is nothing between the base of the charge and the target.

3.  If electric blasting cap is used, connect blasting wires to firing
    circuit.

Note: The effectiveness of this charge can be increased by placing it inside a
can, box, or similar container and packing sand or dirt between the charge and
the container.

    A.  Place the pipe in the vise and cut pipe in half lengthwise.  Remove the
        pipe half sections from the vise.

    B.  Discard one of the pipe half sections, or save for another charge.

2.  Place angle or pipe half section with open end face down on a flat surface.

3.  Make container from any material available.  The container must be as wide
    as the angle or pipe half section, twice as high, and as long as the 
    desired cut to be made with the charge.

4.  Place container over the liner (angle or pipe half section) and tape liner
    to container.

5.  If plastic explosive is used, fill the container with the explosive 
    ising small quantities, and tamp with wooden rod or stick.

Note: If castable explosive is used, refer to step 4 of Sec. II, No. 3.

6.  Cut wooden rod to lengths 2 inches longer than the standoff length (see 
    table).  Postition the rods at the corners of the explosive filled 
    container and hold in place with tape.

Note: The position of the rods on the container must conform to standoff and
penetration dimensions given in the table.

7.  Make a hole for blasting cap in the side od the container .5 in. above the
    liner and centered with the wooden rod.

Note: Do not place blasting cap inside Linear Shaped Charge until ready to
detonate.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place blasting cap into hole on the side of the container.  If non-electric
    cap is used, be sure cap is crimped around fuse and fuse is long enough.

2.  Place (tape if necessary) the LSC on the target so that nothing is between 
    base of charge and target.

3.  If electric cap is used, connect cap wires to firing circuit.

Notes:  1.  Block- wood (10" x 10" x 6" or steel (6" x 6" x 6") with 3/8" 
            diameter hole 1" deep.

        2.  1/4"  O.D. hard brass or wood ram 

Note:  The loading press is provided with a protective barrier and a remote
system of rope and pulley operation to provide operator safety during loading. 
Only wood and spark-proof (brass) metals are used near the exlosive.

CAUTION:  Making detonators is hazardous business that can be made safe by
taking certain precautions.  Operations must be performed slowly and with great
care.  Cleanliness is important.  Dirt in the explosive or containers will
greatly increase sensitivity to detonation by impact or shock.  If possible the
air should be moist.  Boil a bucket of water in the room before starting to 
work if the air is dry.  When inserting and removing the ramrod and when
carrying primary explosives, use tongs or pliers.  If possible, uuse only one
hand at a time when handling the primary explosive in the loading process and
wear protective goggles at all times.

2.  With the arrangement shown on the preceeding page, the pressure applied
    to the exlosive inside the shell casing will be about 200x the force 
    applied to the end of the lever.  That is, a 20 pound weight pulling at
    at the handle will compress the explosive with a press of 4,000 lbs. of
    pressure per sq. in.  This pressure is required for the best sensitivity 
    of mercury fulminate.  A 2.5 gallon bucket of water weighs about 20 lbs.

3.  Light a candle and let two drops of wax drop into the bottom of each 
    shell casing before using.

4.  Allow the wax to cool, then insert the shell casing into the loading 
    block.

5.  Fill the shell casing to a depth of 1/4 in. with RDX or PETN secondary
    explosive.  Gently insert the ram.

6.  Compress the explosive slowly and evenly by pulling on the rope until the
    weight leaves the ground.  Remove the ram carefully.

7.  Continue the adding and pressing operation until a column of secondary 
    explosive 5/8 inch high has been pressed into the 1 inch long shell 
    casing.

8.  Add a small quantity of primary explosive on top of the secondary 
    explosive and gently insert the ram.

9.  Continue the adding and pressing operation until an additional 1/4 inch
    column of primary explosive has been pressed on top of the 5/8 inch column
    of secondary explosive.

10. Gently compress the remaining 1/8 inch of empty space with an igniter of
    either black powder or smokeless pistol powder.

11. Seal the top with either tape or wax paper held in place with a small
    rubber band until ready to use.

Note: When inserting the detonator into a selected hand grenade, be careful not
to tilt the detonator and let the igniter charge spill out.  Instead, place the
grenade over the detonator and lower it until the detonator is sealed into
place, then invert the genade and fill with explosive.

   



Cigarette Lighter Hand Grenade                              Sec. II, No. 13
                                                            
An effective and powerful miniature hand grenade can be made from a Zippo brand
cigarette lighter, any homemade explosive and a mini-compound detonator (Sec.
II, No. 12).  This explosive device can be used either as a hand grenade or a
boobytrap.

Materials
---------

Any powerful homemade explosive, i.e., potassium chlorate/nitrobenzene (Sec. I,
No. 32), ammonium nitrate/nitromethane (Sec. I, No. 34), etc.

Mini-Compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12)

Black powder (Sec. I, No. 3)

Zippo cigarette lighter, approx. 2 1/4" length x 1 1/2" Diam., or larger 

Copper and brass tubing 9/32" diameter x 12" long

hacksaw

small mixing bowl

epoxy resin


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a zippo lighter with outer case dimensions of approx. 2 1/4 long x
    1 1/2" wide x 1/2" deep.  Separate the inner lighter mechanism from the 
    outer casing and remove all the cotton wadding.

2.  Remove the cotton ignition wick and convert it into a black powder time
    fuse by the following steps:

    A.  Place a couple of tablespoons of black powder (sec. I, No. 3) into a
        small mixing bowl and add enough water until it looks like a heavy
        oil.

    B.  The cotton wick is placed in the oil-like mixture and stirred
        for 15 minutes so that it becomes saturated with the black 
        powder mix.

    C.  The cotton wick is removed and hung to dry for four hours.

    D.  This mixture fuse was found to have a burning rate of 1.3 seconds
        per inch.

Note: Be sure and test burning time on a similar wick before using.  If a new
Zippo lighter is used, it is necessary to use the lighter approx. 25 times
before disassembling.  This will make the lighter appear used and will blacken
the cotton ignition wick which will help disguise the black powder time fuse
that will be reinserted.

3.  Reinsert the cotton wick fuse through the wick hole and leave enough fuse 
    in the ignition chamber so that it can easily bepulled from the igniter.

Note: Knot the end of the fuse inside the lighter sothat it won't pull free
later when using.

4.  Using a hacksaw, cut a one inch length from a 9/32" diameter piece
    of copper or brass tubing.

5.  Insert this one inch tube over the wick hole and use a 1/8" layer of 
    epoxy resin or other strong glue to seal in place.

6.  Insert a mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12) into the holding
    tube inside the lighter.

Caution:  The mini-compound detonator is a sensitive and extremely powerful
detonator and should be handled carefully at all times.

7.  Fill the remaining space to within 1/8" of the bottom with any homemade 
    explosive this manual.

Note: The explosive can be loaded in first, and when ready to use, simply 
insert the detonator.  When using potassium chlorate or ammonium nitrate for a
base explosive, load the cigarette lighter with either base explosive and 
insert the detonator.  When ready to use, simply pour in the liquid activator 
of either nitromethane or nitrobenzene.

8.  After filling to within 1/8" in. of the bottom with explosive, cut off a 
    1/8" strip from the original cotton wadding and insert in the bottom of 
    the lighter to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a hand grenade, simply pull out a length of fuse and ignite
    with a separate cigarette lighter or match.

2.  To use as a boobytrap, insert the lighter, with a short fuse, into the
    target area.




Shotgun shell impact grenade                                Sec. II, No. 14

An effective and powerful impact grenade can be made from a 12 gauge shotgun
shell, any homemade high explosive and a mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No.
12).  This explosive devise can be used as an impact grenade or as a boobytrap.

Materials
---------

Any homemade explosive, i.e., potassium chlorate/nitrobenzene (Sec. I, No. 32),
ammonium nitrate/nitromethane (Sec. I, No. 34), etc.

Mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, NO. 12)

12 gauge shotgun shell   
         
wood dowel or steel bar 11/16" in diameter and any length beyond 1/2"

hacksaw

drill w/ 1/4" bit

pieces of cloth, 12" x 12"

epoxy resin or strong glue

steel ball bearings 3/8" in diameter

electrical tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Either cut off or open up the forward end of any 12 gauge shotgun shell and
    empty out the shot, wadding, spacer and propellant.  Retain the shell
    casing.

2.  In order for the mini-detonator to be over the center of the primer, a
    detonator guide cylinder has to be made from either a piece of bar
    steel or a wooden dowel in the following manner:

    A.  Using a hacksaw, cut a 1/2" length of 11/16" steel bar or wooden
        dowel.

    B.  Drill a 1/4" diameter hole in the center of the 1/2 long wood or 
        metal cylinder.

Note: It is preferred that a steel cylinder be used in ot to lend more weight 
to the base of the shell case.

3.  After the guide cylinder is prepared, it is glued in place in the bottom
    of the shotshell case.

Note: Do not place any glue on the primer in the base of the shell casing.

4.  The mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12) is the inserted, open end
    down, into the guide cylinder and glued in place.

Caution: The mini-compound detonator is a sensitive and extremely powerful
detonator and should be handled carefully at all times.

5.  Fill the remaining space in the shotshell case with any homemade high
    explosive in this manual.

Note: When using potassium chlorate or ammonium nitrate for a base explosive,
load the shotshell case with either base explosive.  When ready to use, simply
pour in the liquid activator of either nitromethane/nitrobenzene.

6.  After the top of the shotshell has been resealed, tape a 3/8" steel ball 
    bearing in place over the center of the primer in the base of the shell.

7.  Cloth streamers (12" x 1/2") are then taped in place around the shotshell.
    These streamers lend stability in flight and insure bottom base impact with
    the ground.

8.  As a further refinement, nails can be taped around the shotshell case
    with ntches, spaced 1/4" apart, down the length of the shell.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a grenade, simply throw into the target area.

2.  To use as a boobytrap, do not attach streamers or the ball bearing.  
    Simply insert the shotshell case into the target area.

Platter Charge                                              Sec. II, No. 15

An extremely effective directional charge can be made from a steel pipe cap, 
any high explosive, and a tin can.  This charge is effective against such
targets as transformers, generators, fuel storage containers and vehicles.  It
can be fired horizontally or used as an improvised land mine and fired
vertically.

Materials
---------

Steel pipe cap with a diameter between 1" and 24"

Tin can or other similar container with an inside diameter being the same as 
the steel pipe cap

sheet of wood 1" thick

steel pipe cap, (between 1 - 2" in diameter) and a piece of pipe, (approx. 2" 
in length

drill with 1/4" bit

Solid or liquid high explosive, i.e., nitromethane/ammonium nitrate explosive
(Sec. I, No. 34), fertilizer/hydrazine explosive (Sec. I, No. 36), or
nitromethane liquid explosive (Sec. I, No. 35)

blasting cap


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a steel pipe cap.  An ideal diameter would be 6 - 12".  However, 
    pipe caps as small as 1" may be used.

2.  Locate a coffee can or similar container with an inside diameter the same 
    as the outside diameter of the pipe cap.  Remove the lid (do not throw 
    away) and empty the contents of the can and clean it out.

3.  Place the pipe cap in the bottom of the can with the concave side 
    facing the bottom of the can.
        
4.  An exact center priming disk must be made from a 1" thick piece of wood in
    the following manner:

    A.  Using the coffee can lid from step 2 as a template, place it on a 
        sheet of wood 1" thick and mark the outside diameter with a pencil.

    B.  Using a saw, cut the disk out of the sheet of wood.  After cutting
        the disk out, drill a 1/4" hole through the exact center.  If this
        priming disk is to be used as a packing tool for the solid explosive,
        center sink the 1/4" center hole to fit the head of a 1/4" bolt.  
        Set the disk aside for later use.

5.  If a solid explosive is being used. the following constructon technique
    should be used:

    A.  Using the center priming disk prepared from step 4, a uniform packing
        tool can be prepared by the addition of a 1/4" nut and bolt, a steel
        pipe cap and a piece of pipe.

    B.  Carefully pack an amount of solid explosive equal to the weight of
        the pipe cap around and behind the pipe cap using the packing tool.
        For example, if the pipe cap weighs five pounds, use five pounds of
        solid explosive.

Note: For this charge to be effective, it is necessary to uniformly pack the
explosive behind the pipe cap with no air gaps.

    C.  After the explosive has been loaded into the tin can behind the 
        inverted pipe cap, disassemble the packing tool and place the priming
        disk over the ompressed explosive.  Seal the inside edges with glue,
        wax, or tar.  The discarded pipe handle and cap can be used later to 
        form a pipe hand grenade (Sec. II, No. 1)

Note: The wood priming disk prepared in step 4 has three ain uses: as a packing
tool for solid explosive, as a lid to keep the explosve from falling out of the
conainer, and as a template that insures exact rear center priming of the
charge.

    D.  After the priming disk has been sealed in place, insert a blasting cap
        through the center hole and into the solid explosive to a depth of
        3/4".  Seal around the cap with glue, wax or tar.

6.  When using a liquid explosive, an easier construction method may be
    used:

    A.  When ready to use, simply pour in an amount of liquid exlosive equal
        to the weight of the pipe cap and seal in place the wood priming disk
        prepared instep 4.

    B.  Insert a blasting cap through the center hole and into the liquid 
        explosive to a depth of 3/4".  Seal around the blasting cap with 
        glue, wax, or tar.

7.  If a coffee can was used in the construction, there should still be 
    sufficient room inside the can for a fuzing mechanism, i.e., a wrist
    watch delay timer with battery (Sec. VI, No. 4), or a small remote
    control radio reciever.

Note: A second disguise can be achieved by inseting a third disk covering the
fizing mechanism, sealing around the edges of the disk and then pouring coffee
into the can until full.  Place the plastic sealing lid over the top of the can
to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  The unique capability of this charge is that it can be fired through a
    chain link fence and into its target without any loss of effectiveness.
    At close range the platter will penetrate about one inch of mild steel
    plate.  It is effective at ranges up to 100 feet or more, although at
    this distance penetration is reduced to about 1/4" of mild steel at best
    and sighting becomes a problem unless the target is a very large one.

2.  Upon detonation, the platter is projected forward at tremendous velocity.
    The air in front of the platter is compressed and becomes superheated.  It
    is this mass of air, moving at extremely high velovity, that first 
    penetrates the target.  The platter follows and may indeed strike the
    target, but research has shown that the primary destruction effect is
    created by the compacted high velocity air column.





SCIMP (Special Charge Improvised Projectile) charge         Sec. II, No. 16

Using materials that are readily available in its construction, this mine will
defeat almost any target that is mad-made, i.e., tanks, armored cars, 
buildings, etc.  This charge is four times for effective than any other
directional charge, to include shaped and platter charges.  This directional
charge utilizes two special techniques to achieve its effectiveness; one is
sandwiching an explosive charge between two steel plates, and the other 
involves detonating this charge from all sides at the same time (periphreal
detonation).

Materials
---------

oil filter cap or other similar steel dish

No. 6 sheet metal screws, 1" long

steel plate, 1/8" thick

Solid or liquid high explosive, i.e., fertilizer/nitromethane,
fertilizer/hydrazine liquid explosive, and nitromethane liquid explosive

wood or styrofoam sheets, 1" thick

blasting cap

coffee can or other similar container

drill with 1/4" bit


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a concave steel dish, 3" to 12" in diameter: for example, by 
    removing the center retaining bolt from any two piece oil filter assy.
    and using the oil filter cap (an oil filter from a 1951-53 chevy, with
    a diameter of 5 1/4" is ideal).

2.  Plug the bolt hole in the center of the cap with wood, rubber, or cork
    stopper.

3.  Using the oil filter cap as a template, place it on a sheet of steel 
    1/8" thick and mark the outside diameter with a pencil.

4.  Using a hacksaw, cut the disk out of the plate.

5.  Repear steps 3 and 4, cutting out two disks from a 1" thick sheet of wood
    or styrofoam.

6.  Take the three disks (one steel and the other two wood or styrofoam) and
    glue them together with the steel disk on one side.  Set aside for later 
    use.

7.  Locate a coddee can or similar container with an inside diameter 1/4" to 
    1/2" larger that the outside diameter of the filter ca.  Remove the lid 
    (do not throw away) and empty and clean the can.

8.  Using the coffee can lid as a template, repeat steps 3 and 4 on a 1"
    thick sheet of wood, and after cutting the disk out, drill a 1/4" hole
    in the exact center and set aside for later use.

9.  Place the oil can filter cap in the bottom center of the coffee can
    and glue in place with the concave cap facing towards the bottom of the
    cap.

                 |-------------------------------|   


10. If a solid explosive is being used, the following construction
    technique should be used:

    A.  Mark two rings around the inside of the coffee can; one 3" from the
        bottom of the can, and the second 5 5/8" from the bottom of the can.

    B.  Carefully pack the explosive uniformly around the filter cap until
        it reaches the 3" mark inside the can.

Note: The 1" thick wood disk prepared from step 8 can be used as a uniform
packing tool by attaching an improvised handle using a piece of pipe, two pipe
caps and a 1/4" nut and bolt.

    C.  After reaching the 3" mark inside the can, place the three later disk
        assy. (prepared in step 6) on top of the compressed explosive.  
        Center it with the steel disk on the explosive. 
    
    D.  Carefully pack the explosive between the inside edge of the can and
        the edge of the three layer disk assy. until the explosive level is
        even with the top of the disk.

    E.  Carefully pack an additional 1/2" layer of explosive on top of the 
        last styrofoam or wood disk.  This layer should reach the second ring 
        marked inside the can.

Note: Again the wood disk/pipe packing tool can be used to compress the
remaining explosive on top of the charge.

    F.  Disassemble the wood disk/pipe packing tool by removing the center nut
        and bolt that holds the two together.  Save and use the pipe for a 
        future pipe hand grenade (Sec. II, No. 1).

    G.  Place the 1" thick wood packing disk on top of the explosive contained
        inside the can and seal with glue, wax or tar.

    H.  When ready to use, insert a 1/4" blasting cap through the center hole
        in the wood disk and into the 1/2" layer of explosive.

Note: The wood disk prepared from step 8 has three main uses; a packing tool, a
lid to prevent the explosive from falling out of the container, and a template
that insures rear center priming of the charge.

11. When using a liquid explosive, a slightly different and easier 
    construction method is used:  

    A.  Mark two rings around the inside of the can; one 5 1/8" from the
        bottom of the can and the second 6 5/8 from the bottom of the can.

    B.  Place the top of the three layer disk assy. at the level of the first
        ring marked inside the can and secure in place with four No. 6 sheet
        metal screws spaced wvery 90 degrees around the outside of the coffee
        can and screwed into the center of the center disk assy.  Since the
        disk assy. is smaller than the inside diameter of the coffee can, it 
        can be held in place by inserting 1/4" wood dowels between the can and
        the assy.  When the four supporting screws have been screwed into
        place, the wooden dowels can be removed.

    C.  Place the remaining 1" thick wood disk, prepared from step 8, at
        the level of the second ring marked inside the can and secure
        in place with four more No. 6 sheet metal screws spaced every 90
        degrees around the outside of the can.  Seal the inside edges with
        wax, glue or tar.

    D.  When ready to use, simply pour the liquid explosive through the
        center hole until fill.  Insert a blasting cap through the hole and
        into the 1/2" layer of liquid explosive.  Seal around the hole and
        blasting cap with glue, wax, or tar.

12. If a coffee can was used in the construction, there should still be
    sufficient room inside the can for a fuzing mechanism, i.e., a watch
    delay timer with batteries (Sec. IV, No. 4), or a small remote control
    radio reciever.

13. After the fuzing mechanism has been inserted, the original metal lid
    that was removed and set aside ealier is now glued inside the plastic
    sealing lid that comes with most coffee cans and snapped back in place 
    on top of the can.  The whole charge then resembles an ordinary coffee can.

Note: A second disguise can be achieved by inserting a third disk covering the
fuzing mechanism, sealing around the edges of the disk and the pouring coffee
back into the can until full.  Place the plastic sealing lid over the top of 
the can to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  The SCIMP charge should be used when direct access to the target it not
    possible, i.e., under or beside a roadway or hanging on a fence looking
    into the target area.

2.  The applications are very similar to a platter charge with the exception
    that the SCIMP charge has far greater penetration ability of hard targets 
    at long distances than does the platter charge.  The SCIMP charge 
    described here can penetrate 1" thick steel at 50 years.

Note: The SCIMP charge relies on a super-heated, rod-like projectile traveling
at ultra high velocity to destroy its target.

Typist Note: I, the Mad Cracker, am not going to type every damn picture in the
book.  If you would like to build a "pipe pistol" I suggest you buy the books.
Unless you totally understand the instructions, I would not consider to attempt
these without pictures, as they are dangerous enough when done with the
pictures.

Two (2) wood screws #8

wood 8" x5" x 1"                                

drill

1/4" wood or metal rod, approx. 8" long


Procedure
---------

1.  Carefully inspect pipe and fittings.

    A.  Make sure that there are NO cracks or other flaws in the pipe or
        fittings.

    B.  Check inside diameter of pipe using a 9mm cartridge as a gauge.  The
        bullet should closely fit into the pipe without forcing but the 
        cartridge case SHOULD NOT fit into pipe.

    C.  Outside diameter of pipe MUST NOT be less that 1 1/2 times bullet
        diameter (.536 in; 1.37 cm)

2.  Drill a 9/16" diameter hole 3/8" into one coupling to remove the thread.

Note: Drilled section should fit tightly over smooth section of the pipe.

3.  Drill a 25/64" diameter hole 3/4" into pipe.  Use cartridge as a gauge;
    when cartridge is inserted into the pipe, the base of the case should 
    be even with the end of the pipe.  Thread coupling tightly onto pipe, 
    drilled end first.

4.  Drill a hole in the center of the pipe plug just large enough for the
    nail to fit through.

Note: THE HOLE MUST BE CENTERED IN PLUG.

5.  Push nail through plug until head of nail is flush with square end.  Cut
    nail off at other end 1/16" away from plug.  Round off end of nail wih
    file.

6.  Bend metal strap to "U" shape and drill holes for wood screws.  File two
    small notches at top.     
        
7.  Saw or otherwise shape 1" thick hardwood into stock.

8.  Drll a 9/16" diameter hole through the stock.  The center of the hole
    should be approx. 1/2" from the top.

9.  Slide the pipe through this hole and attach front coupling.

Note: If 9/16" drill is not available, cut a "V" groove in the top of the stock
and tape pipe securely in place.

10. Position metal strap on stock so that top will hit the head of the nail.  
    Attach to stock with wood screws on each side.

11. String elastic bands from front coupling to notch on each side of the 
    strap.

SAFETY CHECK- TEST FIRE PISTOL BEFORE HAND FIRING

1.  Locate a barrier such as a stone wall or large tree which you can stand 
    behid in case the pistol ruptures when fired.

2.  Mount pistol solidly to a table or other rigid support at least ten feet
    in front of the barrier.

3.  Attach a cord to the firing strap on the pistol.

4.  Holing the other end of the cord, go behind the barrier.

5.  Pull cord so that the firing strap is held back.

Cherry Bomb Flechette gun                                   Sec. III, No. 14

Typist note: In the Black book III, the .22 pistol is done again.  Since the 
two are almost identical and therefore, the second one has not be typed and
presented here.  That is the reason for this section being No. 14, instead of
No. 13.

A highly effective, hand held shotgun can be made from 3/4 in. water pipe and
the projectiles are homemade flechettes (steel darts) made from box nails.  
This shotgun uses cherry bombs as a source of propellant and can achieve muzzle
velocities as high as 1300 feet per second.  The effective range is appox. 50
yards.

Materials
---------

3/4 in. diameter water pipe, 12 inches long

3/4 in. pipe coupler and pipe plug

box nails between 1 in. and 1 1/2 in. long

short piece of 3/4 in. water pipe, approx 2 in. long

rubber from inner tube

cork from wine bottle

plaster of paris

hammer and drill with 1/8 in. bit

cherry bombs or homemade flash powder


Procedure
---------

1.  Flechette rounds can be made in the following manner:
    
    A.  Flatten the heads of box nails with a hammer.

    B.  Pour plaster of paris into a mold made from a short section of 3/4 in.
        water pipe, to a depth of 3/8 in.

    C.  Insert the nails, fins down, into this mold and allow the plaster of
        paris to harden. (approx. 20 minutes)

    D.  Push the flechette round out of the mold and set aside for later use.

2.  For every flechette round that is prepared, a gas seal spacer has to also
    be prepared in the following manner:

    A.  Using the short section of 3/4 in. water pipe as a die, sharpen the 
        edges with a file and hammer out circular pieces from a rubber inner
        tube.

    B.  Using a razor blade, cut a 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cord into 
        1/2 in. sections.

    C.  Attach the rubber gas seal to the cork spacer with a thumb tack.

3.  The shotgun may be prepared in the following manner:

    A.  Drill a 1/8 in. diameter hole through the center of a 3/4 in. pipe
        plug, then screw the pipe plug into a 3/4 in. pipe coupler.

    B.  Screw this pipe coupler assy. onto one end of a 12 inch long piece
        of 3/4 in. water pipe.


How To Use
----------

1.  Unscrew the pipe coupler assy. from the end of the pipe.

2.  Insert the flechette round into the pipe.

3.  Insert the gas seal spacer assy. behind the flechette round.

4.  Insert a cherry bomb into the pipe coupler assy. with the fuse protruding
    from the rear of the pipe plug.

5.  Screw the coupling assy. onto the pipe and ignite the fuse.

Note: Gloves should be worn if this weapon is to be hand fired.  With 
sufficient practice, it can be fired, broken down, reloaded and fired again in 
a reasonably short period of time.

A second application is to fire it electrically.

By using an electric bulb initiator (Sec. IV, No. 1) and filling the bulb with
the contents of a cherry bomb, this weapon can be used as an effective booby
trap to cover a trail or other type of passageway.  It can still be hand fired
by means of a hand held battery pack and switch arrangment.

If cherry bombs are not available, the following flash powders can be
substituted:

1.  4 parts by weight of potassium perchlorate
    1 part by weight of antimony sulfide
    1 part by weight aluminum powder

2.  3 parts by weight of potassium permanganate
    2 parts by weight of aluminum powder

3.  4 parts by weight of potassium chlorate
    1 part by weight of sulfur
    1 part by weight of aluminum powder

The fist mixture is standard cherry bomb powder and should be used whenever
possible.

The second mixture is an excellent substitute for the first and is relatively
safe to handle.

The third mixture is extremely shock sensitive and should only be used as a 
last resort.

To use these mixtures, separately pulverize each ingredient into a fine powder.
 Add these powder ingredients to a canning jar or other similar container with 
a tight fitting lid.  Mix thoroughly by gently tumbling the container between
the hands of a period of five minutes.  Add one gram (approx. 1 teaspoon) to an

        =|+|  |+|-------------------------
         |+|::|+|-------------------------
             

where:
        "=" is screw head
        ":" (space between) is rebber disk
        "|+|" is a washer
        "|-|" is a wooden stick

Note: Gun barrel is slightly less than 3/4 in. in diameter.  If rubber disk 
does not fit in barrel, file or trim it very slightly.  It should fit tightly.

3.  Drill a hole through the center of one wooden block of such size that the
    push rod will fit tightly.  Whittle a depression around the hole on one 
    side approx. 1/8 in. and large enough for the grenade to rest in.

4.  Place the base of the grenade in the wooden block.  Securely fasten grenade
    to block by wrapping tape (or wire) around entire grenade and block.

Note: Be sure that the tape or wire does not cover hole in block or interfere
with the operation of the grenade or safety lever.

5.  Drill hole through the center of the second wooden block, so that it
    will just slide over the outside of the gun barrel.

6.  Drill a hole in the center of the bottom of the tin can the same size as 
    the hole in the block.

This diamgram (hmpf!) represents the can, a wood block at the bottom, and nails
holding the block on (they are to be bent over).

8.  Slide the can and block onto the barrel until muzzle passes the can's open
    end.  Wrap a small piece of tape around the barrel an inch or two from the
    end.  Tightly wrapped string may be used instead of tape.  Force the can
    and wooden block forward against the tape so that they are securely held in
    place.  Wrap tape around the barrel behind the can.

Caution: Be sure that the can is securely fastened to the gun barrel.  If the
can should become looses and slip down the barrel after the launcher is
assembled, the grenade will explode aftr the egular delay time.

9.  Remove crimp from a 12 gauge shotgun shell with pen knife.  Open cartridge.
    Pour shot from shell.  Remove wads and plastic liner, if present.

10. Empty the propellant onto a piece of paper.  Using a knife, divide the
    propellant in half.  Replace half of the propellant into the cartridge
    case.

11. Replace the 12 gauge cardboard wads into cartridge case.

Note: If wads are not available, stuff tissue paper or cotton into the 
cartridge case.  Pack tighly.


How to Use
----------

Silent grenade launcher                                     Sec. IV, No. 7
                                                            
A completely silent grenade launcher can be made from a 12 gauge shotgun shell,
pieces of pipe, pipe resucer, wooden dowels and a wine bottle cork.  This
produces a launcher that can propel a fire bottle in excess of 100 yards and a
grenade in excess of 300 yards.  After firing, all of the expanding gas in
contained within the barrel.  This principle of gas containment produces a
completely silent weapon.

    wooden dowel will be mounted

    nuts and bolts, or nails, at least 2 1/2 in. long


Procedure
---------

1.  Carefully inspect pipe and fittings:

    A.  Make sure there are no cracks or other flaws.

    B.  Check inside diameter of pipe.  A 12 gauge shotgun shell should fit
        into the pipe but the brass rim of the shell should not.

    C.  Outside diameter of the pipe must be at least 1 in.

    D.  Screw the 3/4 in. - 1/2 in. pipe resucer onto the front end of the 
        pipe.  Sighting through the rear end of the pipe, ensure that the 
        reduced 1/2 in. center hole is centered with respect to the side 
        walls of the 3/4 in. pipe.  Remove the pipe reducer and set aside
        for later use.

CAUTION: Do not use a pipe reducer that causes an offset center hole when it is
tightened down on the end of the pipe.

2.  Cut stock from wood using a saw:

    | <-                approx. 32 in.                   -> |
    | <-    13 1/2 in.    -> |

n|_ |_____________________________-----------
        

3.  Cut 3/8 in. deep "V" groove int he top of the stock.

4.  Turn the 3/4 in. pipe coupling onto the rear of the pipe.

5.  Coat pipe and "V" groove of stock with shellac or lacquer and while still
    wet, place pipe in "V" groove and wrap pipe and stock together using two
    heavy layers of twine.  Coat twine with shellac or lacquer after each 
    layer.

6.  Using a metal file, file the threaded end of the pipe plug flat.  This
    allows a firm seat between the rear of the shotshell case and the end of
    the pipe plug.  However, because of tapered screw threads on the pipe and
    pipe plug, the pipe coupler my prevent firm seating between the shotshell 
    case and the pipe plug.  If this is the case, fill the space between the
    pipe plug and the shotshell case with 1 in. steel washers with holes in
    the center of the firing pin to pass through.

7.  Drill a hole through the center of the pipe plug large enough for a 8D
    nail to pass through.

8.  Using the same size drill, drill a hole through  the rear side of the
    pipe plug, perpendicular to and intersecting witht he central firing pin
    hole.  This is going to be used as a safety for the firing pin.

9.  Push an 8D nail through the central firing pin hole and cut off flat
    1/32 in. past the end of the pipe plug or the end of the last 1 in. steel
    washer.

10. Using a file, notch the firing pin nail where the side hole intersects
    with the central firing pin hole and file the end round.

11. Using a serparate 8D nail, push it through the side hole.  Note where
    it intersents the firing pin hole and file it flat, to half its normal
    thickness, from that point until it passes through the other side.

12. Insert the firing pin into the central firing pin hole, aligning the slot
    in the firing pin with he safety hole in the side of the pipe plug.

13. Insert the safety nail through the side hole so that it interlocks with
    the central firing pin.  Bend the protruding end of the safety nail 
    around the end pipe plug to ensure that the firing pin is locked into
    place.

14. Insert steel washers, if necessary, and screw end plug tightly into pipe
    coupler.

15. Bend a 4 in. metal strap into an "L" shape and drill a hole for the side
    pivot screw to pass through.  Notch the metal strap on the long side, 1/2
    in. from the bend.

16. Position the metal strap on the stock sp that the top will hit the head of
    the nail.  Attach to the stock using a wood pivot screw.

17. Place a screw on each side of the stock about 4 in. in front of the metal 
    strap.  Pass rubber bands through the notch in the metal strap and attach
    to screw on each side of the stock.

18. Two gas containment pistons should be made in the following manner:

    A.  Cut a 3/4 in. diameter wood dowel to a length of 1 1/2 in.  Round the
        forward edges of the dowel off with file.

    B.  Attach a 3/4 in. diameter, 1/4 in. thick rubber or leather washer
        to the rearend of the wooden dowel with a thumb tack.  If rubber
        or leather of the proper thickness is not available, the washer
        can be built up to 1/4 in. thick with successive layers of thin
        rubber or leather.

    C.  Cut a 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cork to a length of 1 1/2 in.
    
    D.  Set both pistons aside for later use.

19. A launching platform should be made in the following manner:

    A.  Drill a 1/2 in. hole approx. 1 in. deep in the center of the wood
        block.  The 1/2 in. diameter, 30 in. long hard wooden dowel is to
        fir into this hole.

    B.  Drill two 1/4 in. holes on opposite sides of the wooden support
        block.  These holes should be drilled clear through the block for
        bolts to pass through.

    C.  Using the supporting block as a template, mark the bolt holes on the 
        bottom of a tin can which is large enought to hold either a fire
        bottle or hand grenade, then drill the two holes in the bottom of the
        can.  Secure the can to the supporting block by placing 1/4 in. bolts
        through the bottom of the can and the block, securing with nuts.

    D.  Push the 30 in. long, 1/2 in. diameter wooden dowel into the 1 in.
        deep hole in the bottom of the supporting block.  Secure in place
        by driving a nail through the supporting block and into the center
        of the wooden dowel.

20. Prepare a 12 gauge shotgun shell in the following manner:

    A.  Remove crimp from the shell with a pen knife.  Pour shot from shell
        and remove the wads and plastic liner if present.

    B.  Empty the propellant onto a folded piece of paper.  Divide the 
        propellant into thirds.  Replace 2/3 of the propellant back into
        the shell case.

    C.  Replace the 12 gauge cardboard wads back into the shell casing.  If
        wads are not available, stuff tissue paper or cotton into the shell 
        case and pack tightly.


How to Use
----------

1.  To load:

    A.  Remoove the firing pin plug from the rear of the pipe coupler.

    B.  Insert the specially loaded 12 gauge shotgun into the rear end of
        the pipe.

    C.  Insert steel washers if necessary and screw the pipe plug back into
        the rear pipe coupler until it seats against the base of the shell.

    D.  Cover the 3/4 in. wooden dowel (gas containment piston) with Vaseline
        and insert in the forward end of the barrel.  Using the launching 
        platform as a ramrod, push the piston down against the shotgun shell
        in the rear of the launcher.

    E.  Cover the 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cork with Vaseline and press
        down against the wooden piston.

    F.  Secure the 3/4 in. to 1/2 in. pipe reducer tightly to the forward 
        end of the pipe barrel.

    G.  Insert the 1/2 in. x 30 in. wooden dowel launching platform into
        the barrel through the center hole of the pipe reducer and seat
        it against the cork secondary gas seal.

    H.  Isert fire bottle, hand grenade, or pipe bombs into the tin can on 
        the end of the launching platform.

Note: If a fire bottle is used, crumple paper and place in the bottom of the
can.  wrap more paper around the fire bottle and insert into the can.  Use
enough paper so the bottle will fit snugly.

2.  To fire:

    A.  Place stock of launcher against the ground and position the launcher
        at various degrees of elevation, in relation to ground level, so that
        variations of ranges can be achieved.

    B.  Pull firing strap back with thumb.  When ready to fire, release strap.

glass bottle with stopper (1 qt. approx.)

small bottle or jar with lid

rag or absorbent paper (paper towels, newpaper)

string or rubber bands


Procedure
---------

1.  Sulfuric acid must be concentrated.  If battery acid or other dilute
    acid is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are
    given off.  Container should be oven glass or enamel-ware.

CAUTION: Sulfuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is spilled,
wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also dangerous and
should not be inhaled.

2.  Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.

3.  Pour gasoline into the large (1 qt.) bottle until it is approx. 2/3 full.

4.  Add concentrated sulfuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle
    is filled to within 1 to 2 in. from the top.  Place the stopper in the
    mouth of the bottle.

5.  Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION: If this is NOT done, the bottle may be dangerous to handle during use.

6.  Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside 
    of the bottle.  Tie with string ot fasten with rubber bands.

7.  Dissolve 1/2 cup of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup of sugar in one cup of
    boiling water.

8.  Allow the solution to cool, pout into the small bottle and cap slightly.

CAUTION: Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.


How to Use
----------

1.  Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
    around the large bottle.

Bottle can be used wet or after solution has dried.  However, when dry, the
sugar-Potassium nitrate mixture is very sensitive to spark or flame and should
be handled accordingly.  

2.  Throw ot launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard 
    surface (target) the acid in the gasoline will react with the chlorate-
    sugar mixture annd then ignite the gasoline.




Igniter from book matches                                   Sec. V, No. 2

This is a hot igniter made from paper book matches for use with molotov
cocktails and other incendiaries.

Materials
---------

paper book matches

adhesive or friction tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Remove the staple(s) from match book and separate matches from cover.

2.  Fold and tape one row of matches.

3.  Shape the cover into a tube with striking surface on the inside and tape.
    Make sure the folded cover will fit tightly around the taped match heads.
    Leave cover open at opposite end for insertion of the matches.

4.  Push the taped matches into the tube until the bottom ends are exposed 
    about 3.4 in.

5.  Flatten and fold the open end of the tube so that it laps over about 1 in,;
    tape in place.


Use with Molotov Cocktail
-------------------------

Tap the "match end tab" of the igniter to the neck of the molotov cocktail.

Grasp the "cover end tab" and pull sharply or quickly to ignite.


General Use
-----------

The book match igniter can be used by itself to ignite flammable liquids, fuse
cords, and other similar items requiring hot ignition.

CAUTION: Store matches and completed igniters in moistureproof containers such
as rubber or plastic bags until ready for use.  Damp or wet paper book matches
will not ignite.




Mechanically Initiated fire bottle                          Sec. V, No. 3

The mechanically initiated fire bottle is an incendiary device which ignites when thrown against a hd surface.

Materials
---------

glass jar or short neck bottle with a leakproof lid or stopper

tin can or similar container just large enough to fit over the lid of the jar

coil spring (compression) approx. 1/2 the diameter of the can and 1 1/2 times 
as long

gasoline

four (4) "blue tip" matches (I think they are called Ohio kitchen matches)

flat stick or piece of metal roughly 1/2 in. x 1/16 in. x 4 in.

wire or heavy twine

adhesive tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Draw or scratch two lines around the can- one 3/4 in. and the other 1 1/4
    in. from the open end.

2.  Cut 2 slots on opposite sides of the tin can at the line farthest from
    the open end.  Make slots large enough for the flat stick or piece
    of metal to pass through.

3.  Punch 2 small holes just below the rim of the open end of the can.

4.  Tape blue tip matches together in pairs.  The distance between the match
    heads should equal the inside diameter of the can.  Two pairs are
    sufficient.  

5.  Attach paired matches to second and third coils of the spring, using thin
    wire.

6.  Insert the end of the spring opposite the matches into the tin can.

7.  Compress the spring until the end with the matches passes the slot in the
    can.  Pass the flat stick or piece of metal through slots in can to hold
    spring in place.  This acts as a safety device.

8.  Puch many closely packed small holes between the lines marked on the can
    to form a striking surface for the matches.  Be careful to not seriously
    deform the can.

9.  Fill the jar with gasoline and cap tightly.

10. Turn can over and place over the jar so that the safety stick rests on
    the lid of the jar.

11. Pass wire or twine around the bottom of the jar.  Thread ends through
    the holes in can and bind tightly to jar.

12. Tape wire or cord to jar near the bottom.


How to Use
----------

1.  Carefully withdraw flat safety stick.

2.  Throw jar at hard surface.

CAUTION: DO NOT REMOVE SAFETY STICK UNTIL READY TO THROW FIRE BOTTLE.  The
safety stick, when in place, prevents ignition of the fire bottle if it should
accidently be broken.




Gelled flame Fuels                                          Sec. V, No. 4

Gelled or paste type fuels are often preferable to raw gasoline for use in
incediary devices such as fire bottles.  This type fuel adheres more readily to
the target and produces greater heat concentration.

Several methods are shown for gelling gasoline using commonly avilable
materials.  The methods are divided into the following catagories based on the
major ingredient:

        4.1  Lye systems
        4.2  Lye-alcohol
        4.3  Soap-alcohol systems
        4.4  Egg white systems
        4.5  Latex systems
        4.6  Wax systems
        4.7  Animal blood systems


I will type this one warning ONE TIME only! 

CAUTION: Never at ANY time should you light up a cigarette while mixing flame
fuels!  No Smoking!  Go smokeless!


Lye Systems                                                 Sec. V, No. 4.1       
Lye (also known as caustic soda or Sodium hydroxide) can be used in combination
with powdered rosin ot castor oil to gel gasoline for use as a flame fuel which
will adhere to target surfaces.

Note: This fuel is not suitable for use in the chemical (sulfuric acid) type of
fire bottle (Sec. V, No. 1).  The acid will react with the lye and break down
the gel.

    E.  Any vegetable oil (corn, cottonseed, peanut, linseed, etc.)

It is necessary when using substitutes E and D to double the given amount of 
fat and lye for satisfactory bodying.


Procedure
---------

1.  Pour gasoline into bottle, jar or other container.  (Do not use an aluminum
    container)

2.  Add tallow or substitute to the gasoline and stir for about 1/2 min. to
    dissolve fat.

3.  Add alcohol to the gasoline mixture.

4.  In a separate container (Not aluminum) slowly add lye to an  equal amount
    of water.  Mixture should be stirred constantly while adding lye.

5.  Add lye solution to the gasoline mixture and stir occasionally until
    thickened (about 1/2 hour).

Note: The mixture will eventually (1 to 2 days) thicken to a very firm paste.  
This can be thinned, if desired, by stirring in additional gasoline.

Procedure
---------

1.  Separate the egg white from yolk.  This can be done by breaking the egg 
    into a disk and carefully removing the yolk with a spoon.

Note: Do not get the yellow egg yolk mixed into the egg white.  If egg yolk 
gets into the egg white, discard the egg.

2.  Pour egg white into a jar, bottle, or other container and add gasoline.

3.  Add the salt or other additive to the mixture and stir occasionally until
    a gel forms (about 5-10 minutes).

Note: A thicker gelled flame fuel can be obtained by putting the capped jar in
hot (65 degree C) water for about 1/2 hour and then letting them cool to room
temperature.  (Do not heat the gelled fuel containing coffee).

Procedure
--------- 

1.  Obtaining wax from Natural sources:  Plants and berries are potential
    sources of natural waxes.  Place the plants and/or berries in boiling 
    water.  The natural waxes will melt.  Let the water cool.  The natural
    waxes will form a solid layer on the water surface.  Skim off the solid
    wax and let dry.  With natural waxes which has suspended matter when 
    melted, screen the wax through a cloth.

2.  Melt the wax and pour into jar or bottle which has been placed in a hot 
    water bath.

3.  Add gasoline to the bottle.

4.  When wax has completely dissolved in the gasoline, allow the water bath to
    cool slowly to room temp. 

Note: If a gel does not form, add additional wax, (up to 40 % by volume) and
repeat the above steps.  if no gel forms with 40 % wax,, make a lye solution by
dissolving a small amount of lye (sodium hydroxide) in a equal amount of water.
Add this solution (1/2% by volume) to the gasoline wax mix and shake bottle
until get forms.
