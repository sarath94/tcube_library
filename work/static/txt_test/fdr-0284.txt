WHAT IS A POCKET ROCKET ?
-------------------------
 
A DEVICE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 1 3/4
INCHES LONG, THAT WHEN PROPERLY MADE
WILL FLY 4-8 FEET, IF PROPERLY SET OFF.
ALTHOUGH NOT A POWERFUL DEVICE, IT IS 
WELL SUITED TO ANNOYING YOUR DORM-MATE,
OR PERHAPS A CLASSMATE DURING THOSE
OFTEN RECURRING SESSIONS OF BOREDOM.
 
MATERIALS NEEDED
----------------
 
1-PACKET OF MATCHES (CARDBOARD MATCHES,
  NOT WOODEN ONES)
1-PIN (A SMALL ONE, STEAL IT FROM MOMS
  SEWING BASKET)
1-PIECE OF ALUMINUM FOIL, 1 SQUARE 
  INCH FOR EVERY ROCKET (REYNOLDS WRAP)
1-PAIR OF SCISSORS (OPTIONAL)
1-PAPER CLIP (OPTIONAL)
1-CIGARETTEE LIGHTER (OPTIONAL)
 
MAKING THE LITTLE BUGGERS
-------------------------
 
OKAY SO YOU'VE RAIDED THE HOUSE FOR ALL
THE STUFF....
1) TAKE THE PACK OF MATCHES APART BY
   REMOVING THE LITTLE STAPLE AT THE 
   BOTTOM.
2) USE THE SCISORS TO CUT OFF A SINGLE
   MATCH FROM THE BUNCH.
3) CUT OUT A 1 INCH SQUARE OF ALUMINUM
   FOIL AND FOLD IT IN HALF.
4) PUT THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IN THE
   CENTER OF THE CREASE AND PRESS THE
   FOIL SO IT FORMS AROUND THE HEAD
5) WRAP THE REST OF THE FOIL AROUND THE
   MATCH HEAD AS TIGHTLY AND NEATLY AS
   POSSIBLE.
 
NOW U HAVE A MATCH WITH THE HEAD
WRAPPED UP IN FOIL, WITH THE FOIL
COMING 1/2 INCH DOWN FROM THE HEAD.
THIS IS THE WAY YOU'D STORE THEM IF YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO FIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY.
 
*NOTE* - NEATNESS COUNTS, TIGHTNESS
COUNTS, YES YOU CAN JUST RIP A MATCH
OUT, AND RIP FOIL, BUT THE END RESULT
WON'T WORK AS WELL.
 
PREPARATION FOR LAUNCH
----------------------
 
1) TAKE THE PIN AND PUSH IT UNDER THE
   FOIL UNTIL YOU FEEL THE POINT START
   TO CRUSH THE HEAD. KEEP THE PIN AS
   CLOSE TO THE MATCH AS POSSIBLE WHEN
   DOING THIS.
2) BEND THE PAPER CLIP TO FORM A 45 DEG
   ANGLE WITH THE HORIZON, AND SET IT
   ON A RELATIVELY NON-FLAMMABLE
   SURFACE, POINTING IN THE DIRECTION
   YOU WISH TO FIRE THE ROCKET.
3) REMOVE THE PIN FROM THE MATCH AND
   GINGERLY SET THE MATCH ON THE PAPER
   CLIP, BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CRUSH THE
   FOIL DOWN (THE PLACE THE PIN WAS IS
   NOW THE EXHAUST PORT).
 
LAUNCH
------
 
HEAT THE HEAD OF THE MATCH (THE PART
COVERED WITH FOIL) TILL IGNITION.
 
NOTES
-----
 
NEATNESS ALWAYS COUNTS ON THESE BUGGERS
, ALWAYS USE SCISSORS WHEN POSSIBLE.
YOU SHOULD USE A LIGHTER INSTEAD OF A
MATCH SO U DONT GET SCORCHED FINGERS.
I HAVE YET TO GET A 2 STAGE ROCKET TO
FLY, IF YOU DO UPDATE THE FILE. IF ALL
OF THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU THEN
PERHAPS PAGE 45 OF 'THE GREAT 
INTERNATIONAL PAPER AIRPLANE BOOK' SAID
IT BETTER...
 
  "POCKET ROCKET. INSTRUCTIONS: WRAP
   ALUMINUM FOIL AROUND UPPER HALF OF
   PAPER MATCH. PUSH STRAIGHT PIN UP
   UNDER FOIL TO HEAD OF MATCH AND 
   REMOVE AGAIN LEAVING EXHAUST 
   CHANNEL. PLACE MATCH ON OPENED
   PAPER CLIP AND HOLD LIGHTED MATCH
   TO TIP. STEP BACK."
