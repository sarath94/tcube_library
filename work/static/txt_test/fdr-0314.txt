   Materials

1 Large pipe (about 6 inches long, 1/2-two inchs wide) (threaded ends)
2 Pipe caps (threaded and that fit your pipe)
Black powder (a lot)
1 Penicl (or something that is long, thin and doesn't conduct static 
  electricity)
1 Drill (that can drill thur metal)
1 Fuse
2 Balls (tha ones in ya boxer shorts)

   How to make it

   Take tha pipe and put one cap on.  Then take tha other cap and drill a 
small hole thur it (small as in slighty smaller then tha fuse).  Now pour 
tha black powder slowly into tha pipe (only one cap is on).  After you have 
about 1/2 inch in then LIGHTY TAP it with tha eraser end of tha pencil.  Just
tap it down.  Then pour more in (about 1/2 inch) and tap it down again.  Do 
this till you are about to tha top.  Then push tha fuse into tha powder (deep
into tha powder).  Then push it thur tha hole in tha second pipe cap.  SLOWLY
screw tha other cap on.  Now pull tha fuse tight.  Trim tha fuse to whatever 
length you want.  I keep it long.  That is it.  You have made tha third most 
powerful pipe bomb there is.  Tha second most powerful is with a plastic 
explosive and an electric charge.  That pipe bomb costs about $15-$20.

   How to use

   Light tha fuse and run.  I use a LONG fuse.  Why?  Cause I have found 
peices of my pipe bomb about a block away from where I set it off.  So unless
you can run like Forest Gump, make it a long enough delay to get FAR away.  I
like to put these in mail boxes, telefone booths, and other places like that.
In a telefone booth it will either break tha glass or it will GO THUR tha 
plastic.
