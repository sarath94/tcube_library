        Have you ever found yourself in a position where you need up to 
fifty bucks REAL FAST?  LIke you just finished all your pot and need
to buy another quarter?  I have many times... so this is what I do.

1.)  Get a check, preferably not yours (if it was yours that would
totally defeat the purpose).  Steal it, find it, pull it out your
 grandmothers ass, etc..
 
2.)  Go to a bookstore (B. Dalton, Crown, and Walden are the best
cause they NEVER check I.D.)

3.)  Say, "Can I get a fifty dollar gift certificate?"
 
4.)  Take that gift certificate to another store

5.)  Buy a .50 bookmark with it.  Keep the change.

        The best way to do this is to get a whole checkbook
and spend the day driving about from store to store buying
and cashing.  The above bookstores are not the only ones 
where you can do this.  MANY establishments have real loose
check I.D. policies.  If you have trouble finding a checkbook
go to a parking garage and look for one in an unlocked car.

        If the store does ask for I.D. then calmly say you
have none, the check is your moms, you boyfriends, you holy
guardian angels, etc..  Get the check back and leave.  Do 
NOT rip off the same place twice.  Many chains after they 
discover they have been ripped off will try to send a 
description around to their other stores and then you will
be fucked.

Have Fun and if anyone asks just tell 'em some guy told
you how to do this.

If you have any questions you can NOT locate me on the 
following bbs's. (I was a former employee at a store I 
rip off in this way and do not want to be busted.)
