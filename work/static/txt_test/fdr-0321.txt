More Krazy Glue Tricks

   Ah, that wondrous compund, cyanoacrylate. Many, many companies
make the stuff but we all affectionately refer to it as KRAZY GLUE.
   In my first pranks file about half the file was devoted to Krazy Glue,
and its many blessings, and after giving it some thought, have come up
with some more gems for ya.
   In this file, it shall be demonstrated that it is possible to sabotage
nearly ANYTHING with Krazy Glue.

More Krazy Glue Tricks

  same thing to his volume control, at full volume.

- Alternatively, Krazy Glue all the toothpaste tubes, pill bottles, etc to
  the shelves of same med. cabinet.
- If your enemy is a diabetic and you want to reduce him to fear for his
  life, Krazy Glue the plungers of all his insulin syringes so he can't
  inject. This is also good to do to druggies.
- Krazy Glue your enemy's ni-cads into the charger. Put a few non-
  rechargeables in as well.

  shut.

  alternatively, Krazy Glue the whole fridge door shut.

  favorite gun so it won't work when he goes to the range. Major
  Embarrassment.
- Krazy Glue your enemy's kid's TransFormer so that it won't TransForm.
- Unplug your enemy's TV cable. Put a drop of Krazy Glue in that tiny hole
  in the middle of the wall jack. Don't bother plugging it back in, and when
  the enemy goes to plug it back in, he won't be able to.
- Put that asshole's favorite disks into one of his disk boxes. Krazy Glue
  the box SHUT.
- Krazy Glue that little rubber plug on the bottom of the dick's piggy bank
  ON.
- Cut a tiny (1/8") slit into the cunt's Hacky Sack. Through this slit,
  saturate the whole innards of the sack with Krazy Glue. Use a whole
  tube of the shit if you like. Your enemy will not even notice until he
  goes to give the footbag a good solid BOOT, and it will be ROCK hard by
  that time.

  shut and the tires to the wheel's rim.

  shut off the alarm when it goes without unplugging the damn thing.
- If your enemy is rinning for prez or something, Krazy Glue his campaign
  posters to the walls. After the election is over he will be required
  to take the things down, but what if he can't??????

  idea to substitute EPOXY for Krazy Glue when you glue the toilet handle
  (either your enemy's or all the school's) so it can't flush.
