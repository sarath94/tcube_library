Introduction: Elite manuals

     -Elite manuals have been circulating as far back as world war 2 when 
      they were dropped behind enemy lines,  these manuals were simple to
      do hand guides with directions for making explosives to fight their 
      occupiers.
     -These manuals gave step by step directions for making explosives to
      be used against occupying enemies.  Some directions were techniques
      to making molotov cocktails and methods to damaging railway tracks.
     -After WW2,  many of these manuals fell into the hands of anarchists
      and terrorists who carried out these techniques for their own use.
      During the 1970's, a rebellious author wrote the popular and banned
      book `The Anarchist cookbook'.  This manual taught one to make many
      drugs such as LSD, Hash  and shrooms and pyrotechnics such as black
      powder and nitroglycerine.
     -In another  release, the book `The Poor mans  James Bond' by author
      Kurt Saxon, was filled with instructions on building explosives and
      doing it within the kitchen.  I consider this much more informative 
      then the previous guides and more valuable to anyone willing to act
      upon destruction.      
     -Besides explosives, it also taught accurate information on building
      car bombs and making a still.  
     -During the early 1980's,  computer bulletin boards became a popular 
      trend in computer hacking.  Elite manuals on building boxes to hack
      the  telephone companies and lists  of codes to to break into major 
      computer networks had become quite popular.  
     -It is believed that the first trend of elite manuals on pyrotechnic
      directions  appeared in 1984 on the bulletin board called Pirate-80
      according to information I attained.  Besides recipes for explosive
      devices, there was a lot of formulas for contrabanned products such
      as street drugs.
     -Since that date,  I think about 15,000 manuals have been written by
      thousands of authors of all age.  Most were repeated manuals simply 
      continuous duplicates written by other people stealing credit.  The
      trouble was also, most manuals were cheaply written by retarded kid 
      writers who had not a clue.   Other manuals were merely a few lines
      on making a molotov cocktail or smoke bomb.  
     -If these 15,000 manuals were to be divided into categories,  beside
      the manuals on explosives, there were manuals on drug formulas, the
      conducting hypotism, witchcraft/satanism and occult.  A lot of step
      by step lock  picking methods, ways to Robbing pop/vending machines
      and most common were the hundreds of files on building boxes to get 
      long  distance calls and how to listen into neighbors conversations
      by phone.
     -Today most of these boxes, techniques and scams are outdated,  Only
      formulas for  pyrotechnics  and drugs can be used still but most of
      the popular things of that time frame are totally outdated forever.    
     -The textfile, which was what the manuals were called; are now dying
      out of existence.    Most bulletin boards in the United States that 
      were into these manuals have gone down and nobody is willing to put
      new ones up.  Most of the hacking generation have now grown old and
      taken a new role in life and those who wrote  most of these manuals
      have jobs and families.
     -One of the last most popular manual bulletin boards  `Lunatic Labs'  
      may already have gone down.  This board was probably the most known
      bulletin  board in Los Angeles and  California for its genius sysop 
      who wrote many of his own manuals that included drugs and explosive
      formulas.    This might be one of the final blows to manual support
      bulletin boards in the United States forever.  Let it not be forgot
      or forgiven.

Elite Manuals
      -The problem with most of the circulating  elite manuals in Windsor
       and anywhere for that matter is that they are written so poorly by
       kid writers who don't have a clue.    I truly believe that most of
       these  manuals have been written  by kids who have no chemistry or
       science knowledge.
      -I myself am experienced  in a lot of pyrotechnics and can say that 
       I have attempted  and succeeded  in many  of these manuals and can
       say it with some pride.  However, I prefer that those reading this
       manual do  not even considering attempting  a single percentage of
       this document.  The reasons are obvious:

        -  Explosives are not toys, they are dangerous and are most often
        used to kill or inflict terror.  Something as simple as a molotov 
        could ruin several years of ones life and even a life itself.

        -  By law,  any production of these items and usage that could be  
         cause of damage to person or property could face countless years 
         in prison,  large fines and a  record that could effect your own 
         chance for a career, vacation or joining an organization for the 
         rest of you life.

      -Most manuals fail to advantage  the  reader because they tell them 
       to simple add chemicals and follow the directions.  What many fail
       to do is give advice on getting many of these chemicals.  They may
       just say  "You can get all this stuff from a school lab", I wonder 
       why they do it.    They must think everyone has a chemistry course
       or something.  Besides this fact, they  also are putting out a few
       manuals on making explosives  that would  cost hundreds of dollars
       to produce.  How stupid!
      -For many people, terrorism is a big market.  The use of terror can
       bring fortune while others can use this form of terror for laughs
       while others can experiment to see how simple it is to make a bomb
       and the devastation it can cause.
      -In this manual I have written, I will examine and explain how easy
       it  is to develop a powerful  explosive or explosive device.   The     
       following  should not be carried out  and I take no responsibility
       if one is  injured by my writings  because I am not writing a book
       on making explosives but writing a  point of view to show how easy
       it is to make explosives in Windsor, Canada.
      

       Supplies Required

      -In order to make anything in this manual you must get ahold of the
       list of required supplies.   As I wrote before, most  writers tend 
       to avoid giving us information about the required supplies  but go
       right into the directions.  I will explain just where to get these 
       supplies as well as prices. 
      -In this manual,  the price for the average person to  build a bomb
       is quite cheap.  It could cost at under  $20 to cause thousands in 
       damage.  Considering the person is living in Canada and especially
       in Windsor,  here is a combined list of all required supplies  for
       this manual.
      -As you will notice,  all these supplies can be bought by anyone as
       easy as buying any other product.

1.0    Saltpetre

      -One of the most  easiest pyrotechnic items that can be bought in a
       pharmacy is the white substance called`Potassium Nitrate' as known
       as Saltpetre.  For just several dollars you can make a lot of neat
       things with it.
      -Two very cheap and easy things that can be made with Saltpetre are 
       smoke screens(a.k.a smoke bombs) or fuses(a.k.a wicks).

       Smoke Screen

       Supplies Required:

       Potassium Nitrate
       Sugar
   
       Procedure: 

    1. Make  sure that the potassium Nitrate and sugar are grounded up 
       into a fine powder.
    2. Now add the potassium nitrate and sugar together at these ratios
     --> 1 part  Potassium nitrate
     --> 1 part  Sugar                                                  
   3. Now mix the potassium nitrate and sugar together and make sure that
      it is well mixed together for the best results.
   4. To detonate it, you just add an open flame and it should ignite and
      produce a lot of smoke.   The best way to make a lot of smoke is to
      have the powder contained.    Put the smoke screen mixture into the
      coke cans you drink out off and drop a few matches into the hole.  

      Fuses

      Supplies Required:

      Potassium Nitrate
      White Sugar
      Soft cotton string
      Soap

   1. In a small bowl, fill it up with soapy hot water and let the cotton
      soak into this solution for about 10 minutes.
   2. In a second glass, fill it was two parts hot soap water and mix one
      part Potassium nitrate with one part sugar.
   3. Let it soak for about 1 hour and take out the string and let it dry
      and its done.
   4. These fuses ain't as good as you will  probably think but they will
      work.   If you want to get a good fuse and don't want to make these
      type,  just go to the grocery store and get  sparklers for birthday
      parties.  These are cheap and much safer and reliable.      


2.0    Black Powder

      -In any powerful explosive,  there is required the explosive itself
       such as nitroglycerine,  TNT, and even Black Powder.   In military
       explosives, they tend to use more powerful explosives such as  TNT
       or  dynamite but many  urban terrorists would use the cheapest and
       the most available such as black powder.
      -Black powder is bought in most U.S. states but  not in Canada, the
       closest  to getting it in Canada would be probably privately made.
       However making it would be quite easy and also quite cheap.

       Supplies Required
   
       Potassium nitrate
       Sulfur
       barquiette Charcoal

   1. Take each item individual and grind them up into the finest powders
      as possible.  Use a blend and grind each down until it is so fine.
   2. Once you have blended them into a fine powder, mix them into a bowl
      with this ratio:
       6 parts potassium
       2 parts Charcoal
       1 part Sulfur

   3. Once the three are mixed together in that ratio,  mix it up as much
      as possible until it is a fine gray powder.  DO NOT! I repeat DON'T
      use the blender once these have been all combined.  This new formed
      powder is shock and friction  sensitive and could explode instantly 
      if put in a blender.
   4. Once completed,  store the powder in a plastic margarine container,
      This will prevent it from getting water, and keep in a cool place.

      -There  are other ways to making black powder but this is the  best
       of them all.  There are many other fast burning agents around that
       could be used for building explosive devices.   Especially the Gun
       Powder used in shotgun shells. 
      -Gun powder can be bought by the pound in Windsor for under $20s 
       and its even better then this home made black powder.  If you can
       get ahold of gun powder, this would be the substitute that can be
       used to replace Black Powder in any device.
      -There are many other fast burning agents  that are in the form of
       flash powder, but the problem with flash powder is that making it
       is extremely expensive or hard to obtain many of those supplies.


3.0    Home built explosives

      -Home build explosives are probably the most common urban explosive
       devices available because they are built from inside the house. In
       better terms, they are easy to make weapons of destruction.
      -The most positive thing about home build explosives are that it is
       quite easy to cause a local disaster seen for under 20 bucks and I
       mean disaster as windows being blown out of  cars and debbie found 
       as for as a block.  Nothing more said.
      -One of the first and most historical home build explosives was the
       molotov cocktail.  These were greatly used by the Russians and the
       Hungarians during the German invasion.   These are still common in
       almost any riot in the world and used by vandals continuously. 
      -The greatest part of the molotov cocktail is that they can be made
       by the hundreds for few dollars and the damage that it could cause
       would have made LA look small.   Though nobody could get away with
       those many attacks at once.

       Supplies Required

       Glass Bottle (Pop, Beer or Ketchup bottle)
       Gasoline
       Rag

   1. With the average pop bottle, fill it up with 3 quarters of gasoline
      and stick a gasoline soaked rag into the top as a cork like top.
   2. The disadvantage is the rag, it would be a good idea if to soak the 
      rag  in the gasoline over night before sticking it into the cork of
      the bottle.
   3. Now it is wise to wipe the bottle of the gasoline  that might be on 
      the outer bottle.  This would prevent a future problem of igniting.
   4. To detonate, quickly ignite the rag and throw  the bottle as far as
      possible.  Once the bottle shatters, the gasoline will fly all over
      its target area and ignite in a huge fire!
   
     -Lastly,  the destruction by the molotov cocktail is great, if it is
      targeted against something that could further  burn such as a truck
      or car, it'll be a excellent device for a arson.  
     -The dangers of the  molotov cocktail are just  as a disadvantage as
      the advantages.  These are so flammable that it could explode if it
      is ignited to soon and blow up in your face.   You would get a lump
      in your  throat if  you could see what a person who was burned by a
      gasoline fire looked like, I have and it isn't good. 


3.0   The FAMOUS Pipe bomb:
  
     -Do you  remember the Smooth Brothers in Detroit?  Well, if you know
      about them, then  I suppose you watch to much news like me.   These
      guys were a  gang  who spent  their lives  manufacturing pipe bombs 
      until they were busted  and got charged with a stiff fine. The guys
      were selling these explosives at 5 dollars a piece.
     -The thing about pipe  explosives are  that they are so powerful and
      very destructive.  They are as powerful as military hand grenades.
     -The thing about Pipe bombs are that  they are the Urban weapon that
      of all weapons.  They are more deadly then molotov  cocktails but I
      think both are equal in their own ways in conflicting damage.
 
      Supplies Required

      Metal piping (8 inch pipe with caps)
      Black Powder
      Sparklers 

   1. Once you have correct metal piping,  you must compare the drill bit 
      with the size of the sparklers you have so the sparker can fit into
      the hole with ease.
   2. Now drill the hole into the center of the pipe.  With the sparklers
      you must  use a wire cutter and get rid of  that thin metal wire on
      the sparklers that is used to hold it when the sparkler is burning.
   3. Now just fit the sparker into the piping device, using clue or wax,
      make sure that the sparkler cannot fall out of the pipe if its ever
      jerked around.
   4. Now fit one cap on TIGHTLY and fill the pipe with 7/8s of the black
      powder and then gentle fit on the second cap TIGHTLY.
   5. You now are finished and you have yourself the famous Pipe bomb, to
      detonate,  make sure you are far away as  possible when it explodes 
      because the metal fragments fly very fast and far. To detonate just 
      ignite the sparklers and watch the pipe explode.

     -The popular thing  about pipe bombs is that they can be made  quite 
      easily with the right supplies.   The trouble is, you can buy a lot 
      of this stuff in bulk when you shop for pipe parts,  people working 
      will get quite suspicious and likely know what you intend to do.


4.0   Glass Container explosives

     -These are cheaper to build then the pipe explosives because you can  
      save money when buying the metal piping parts, however these  don't
      make as much of a disaster scene than the pipe explosives would.

      Supplies

      Black Powder
      Small wine or perfume bottle
      Wick/sparkler
  
   1. Take  a small bottle and drill a very  small hole in top of the cap
      and stick a long wick into it.   Make sure the hole isn't as big as 
      the pipe explosive hole was.
   2. Once the bottle cap is ready, now fill the bottle with 3/5 of black
      powder.  Cap the bottle and make  sure that the wick is inserted in
      the black powder to ignite it. 
   3. You should now have completed this easy to make bottle explosive so
      just light the wick and make sure  you get away from it like you do
      if you had ignited the pipe explosive.
  
     -The trouble with these is that its harder to find the perfect glass
      container.  I found that the small wine bottles that you can buy or
      get on airplanes are the best to use.  However, I have had afew bad
      experiences with these type of explosives. 

     -I have stolen a textfile example from another file and used it as an 
      example to explain what it should look like, you might not know what
      what I am talking about.

      Light Bulb Explosives

     -This type of explosive can  have an advantage and disadvantage with 
      them.  It can be quite a shocker for whoever you wish to target but
      is does little damage, maybe a few burn marks, etc.
     -There  are two ways of making these,  I prefer both but again, each 
      have their advantages and disadvantages.

      Supplies

      Light bulb (100v)
      Black Powder
      Gasoline

5.1

  1.  Using very gentle hands, drill a small hole near the socket part of
      the light and fill it 4/5 with black powder until the filaments can 
      touch the powder.  Now put a piece of tape over the hole so it  can
      make the bulb portable without losing any of its powder inside it.

     -Now, just go and turn of the light and switch bulbs.  Make sure you
      don't turn the light on and get out of the room.  Once the targeted
      person turns the light on, the filament will shock the black powder
      and it'll go boom!
     -The explosive won't be that deadly, cause the black powder isn't in
      a stronger contained object, it'll just burn without producing alot
      of pressure that usually makes most explosives deadly.
     -The part I like about these  is that they can be used just to scare
      the hell out of a person instead  of killing or injuring them as of
      other explosive devices.

  2.  Another light bulb explosive that can do much more damage is to get
      gasoline and  fill 3/4 of the bulb with it.   Then take some of the
      black powder and fill that also into the bulb.   Again, use tape to
      shut the hole.
     
     -This time you must treat this bulb with more care because the glass
      bulbs are so fragile, they can just break with the weight inside of
      it.
     -Now, once you insert it and the targeted person turns the light on,
      the gas will go boom and it'll  separate all over  the room causing
      the room to be engulfed with flames.  It'll not history or kill the
      guy but it could burn in if the burning gas touches onto him and on
      his head. 
    
     -Below I have drawn  an example on how the bulb should look when you
      make the device.

     -Again, the disadvantages of the bulb explosive is when transporting
      it around.    The glass is very fragile and can break any time once
      you have put a hole into it.  Another disadvantage is that it won't
      blow an entire street up unlike the other ones.
     -I suppose that disadvantage of it not doing much destruction is now
      an advantage  if you are intending to just scare someone but not to
      hurt him/her in any way.
     -Another advantage  is that it is another easy device to make around
      the house if you choose not to use black powder.   You just replace
      with gasoline and you have yourself a proud home made explosive and 
      its quite cheap to build.


6.0   Tire Fire!
  
     -Besides explosives all the time,  if  someone was willing to cause
      alot of havoc, destruction isn't the only way but so is disturbing
      the peace or causing a fire.
     -Many will choose to arson something  instead  of going through the
      pain of buying and making explosives.  Truly, arson is the oldest
      known form of terrorism.  Throughout the history books, they would
      burn houses, towns and the farmers fields in their beliefs.  Arabs
      forced out the jews and Christians by burning down their homes and
      fields during the ISLAMIC empire.
     -This was the only way to force out large amounts of people from an
      area.   Today arson is alive and well, mostly in the western world
      it is done by the average criminal.   Someone who does it isn't an
      arson  and the penalty in Canada for arsons are quite severe.   If
      you are arrested, you cannot get bail. 
     -One of the popular arsons would use gasoline, I myself do not wish
      to be called an arson, I do not attempt to destroy public property
      or nature itself.  I would ignite a fire, I would likely make sure
      its out first.
     -One popular way of causing havoc is burning tires, I have done one
      tire myself and it was amazing.   Using alot of gasoline, actually
      I used a propane torch, I ignited a tire into a ball of fire.   It
      was  burning so big that I sent a  mile high smoke cloud into  the
      sky so to prevent getting caught I fled,  even half a mile away in
      a certain area, I could see smoke.   The fire department then came
      and put it out.  The Funny part, they probably though it was a big
      fire until they got there.
     -I just wrote to inform you of this different kind of terrorism.
     
7.0  Almost Done

      -In these final chapters  of this elite manual I would just like to 
       note  that it doesn't take a genius to know how to build bombs,  I
       have proven that myself.  Though it might be fun,  it is also  the
       most deadliest thing next to drugs.  Though I prefer to do both!!!
      -In the next few manuals I will put up, I will note my knowledge on
       more advanced pyrotechnics such as nitroglycerine and plastique in
       the kitchen but until then, I just hope I can survive.

8.0   Targets they have chosen

      -Smoke Bombs-
 
      -One of my funniest smoke bomb attacks was in another city  where I
       grew up until I moved to Windsor 2 years ago.  It was at a popular
       mall called The Eatons center.  Not the one in Toronto, anyway,
       I let one off in the underground parking lot, anyways, it sent the
       fire department.  Of course I didn't get caught but  I was running 
       for hours to get away from that area.       
      -Smoke bombs  are popular for just  watching them smoke up  without 
       causing havoc.  I prefer just laughing at the smoke.   One popular
       target would be at a school, I suppose this is quite risky because
       you'll get caught if they look for you, witnesses are also in your
       classes remember..

      -Molotov Cocktails-
 
      -I have  made countless cocktails in my time and it seems as if you
       have an imagination, these things are cool everytime.  I have done
       damage with these because they are so destructive.  Though I don't
       attack  property of any kind because if you are caught,  you're in
       prison.
      -Most people would use these to vandelize property such as homes or
       cars.   They are also popular in  a lot of riots in most countries
       besides this boring one.   Remember, if you are caught with one of
       these, you could be charged for attempting arson. 

       -Pipe explosives-
 
      -These things are so illegal  and destructive,  I am afraid to even
       say what I have done with these.   To be honest,  I have done very
       little except damage a fence during a cold winter day.   I did set
       afew of along the railroad tracks, they make alot of noise and lot
       of smoke.
      -These are  quite popular in the states I think,  they are powerful
       and used for almost anything.  I remember once that six pipe bombs
       were laughed from a homemade missile launcher  and were fired into
       the downtown LA business area.   This made big news even though it
       didn't do serious damage and no injuries.   The main point,  these
       are serious devices of destruction, don't get caught.

      -Light Bulb explosives-
 
      -I hope nobody is  stupid enough to set one of these up  in his/her
       own home.  It would be neat to enter a highschool during the after
       hours and set on up in the bathroom.   Once the janitor goes to do
       his thing(Clean up) he will likely turn on the light.    It is his
       duty to also check in bathrooms at one point and lock the doors
       incase anyone is hiding in them,  so likely they will go in there.
      -I suppose that the best way is to have an imagination when you are
       planning to use this type of device.

      -Glass Containers-

      -These things are crazy,  one day this same type  of explosive went
       off as I set it down on the stairs of the back door of the  Little 
       Ceasors.  It exploded sending glass everywhere, cutting my knee up
       pretty bad.   The manager came out of the door and started yelling
       at me.  I said "I've been blown up" in a silly way.
      -Just let them off anywhere as long as there ain't anyone around to
       get hurt.  These ain't as destructive as pipe bombs. 

      -Tire Fire and arson-

      -Personally I think  that  arson is  stupid and idiotic because you
       don't prove anything.    However, tire fire is an individual thing
       that can't do much harm as  long as its not near anything that can
       catch fire.
      -Outside of Hamilton several years ago, several kids from age 13 to
       17 started  Canada's largest  tire fire.   It was in a town called 
       Hagersville.  It took 3 weeks to put the fire out.   This sent all
       sorts of smoke all over Ontario and the U.S.     


      Almost Done

      As you can see, it doesn't take a genius to make explosives, all it
      takes is some reading and a good imagination.    The most important
      thing when dealing with using explosives is not to get caught.
      I apologize for any spelling mistakes or the constant  bad sentence
      structure but I am using a  stupid PC-Write and it is  terrible for
      using margins.
      I hope to  release a dozen more manuals on advanced explosives and
      many other areas in dealing with topics that are commonly seen but
      written by idiot kid writers without a clue!

 LAST COMMENTS:

  As I have finished my first file on pyrotechnics I would just like to
 say that I will release about a dozen in the next months or so.  I do
 suggest that nobody does this stuff and if they are just experimenting,
 do not target important property for that matter.

 If you wish for any other type of information, just leave me some mail
 and I'll be glad to get back to you.

 You can find me at any good Windsor bulletin boards where you got this
 file.
