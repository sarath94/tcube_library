Main feature: The ORIGINAL SHITBOMB(TM)

Materials required

  * Plastic bag thats sufficient to contain the bomb material
  * The bomb material to put in the bag
  * About 7 meters of thin line
  * Nightly highway with cables going across it

Plastic bag

  I suggest that you select a normal sized transparent plastic bag, big enough
  to contain the payload, small enough to be as stealth as possible.

Thin Line

  Any strong and thin line will do.

The Bomb Material

  If you fill the bag with stuff like broken eggs, ketchup, senap, syrup, glue,
  throw them in the bag directly. The problem with these materials is that your
  parents might miss them, but don't worry the next material won't be missed.

  If you want to use shit, then you have to shit into a trash bag (or similar),
  because it's difficult to hit the small bag. Take the shit out of the trash
  bag using small bags as gloves and put it in the small bag.

  Shut the bag containing the bomb material and you bomb is ready.

Highway at night

  Any highway with wires across it, lotsa truck traffic* and sufficient
  traffic pauses to avoid spotting you will do. Don't do this at daytime or
  near roadside lights. A hill or a curve just before the spot would also be
  very nice. I suggest targeting only trucks with the bomb, because they
  are less likely to avoid the bomb or to stop suddenly you and easy to select
  due to their highness.

Setting the bomb

  (length of rope) = (2*height of wire) - (2*height of truck window) + extra
  example:       7 =  2*5-2*2+1

  Tie one end of the line to the bomb and the other end to a rock.
  Throw the rock over the cable and lift the bag to the height of a truck window
  now untie the rock (if you don't want smash the window, then the bomb might
  enter the truck cabin, but it probably would be more hazardous). Tie the other
  end of the line to the bag so that the bag is left hanging at the height of
  a truck window (2 meters in this example), no need to be precise, just
  set it at the middle of the lane.

Likely outcomes

  After the bomb is set just wait and watch in the nearby woods about 50 to 100
  meters away from the spot and highway, the anticipation of splash is even more
  exciting than the splash itself.

  Several things may happen

    outcome 1. the bomb hits, if you need to remove the line, then just use
               a long stick and some paper are a torch and burn the line off
               the cable.
    outcome 2. the bomb misses, go and adjust its horizontal/vertical position
    outcome 3. the bomb is avoided, just wait for the next truck
    outcome 4. a car/a truck stops and removes the bomb, if they don't take it
               with them, just go and put it back.
    outcome 5. cops stop at the spot, stay and watch, if you feel unsecure
               move farther into the woods, but BE SILENT.

            THIS METHOD HAS BEEN TESTED WITH LIVE TRUCKERS AND COPS

Bonus feature: Tyres in flames

  Your local fire department needs some activities, so it's time for tyres
  in flames.

Materials:

  * A car tyre (just the rubber, no need for the middle section)
  * 1/2 litres of gasoline

  Just wait for a pause in the traffic, place the tire on the side of the road,
  pour the gasoline on it and light it. Leave the scene and watch from 50 to 100
  meters away. If you have a car, then you may want to go and drive back'n'out
  and at the spot. After a while head towards your local fire department and
  follow the truck to the scene. And if you want to be real creative, try to
  use shitbomb to the windshield of the incoming fire truck.

        THIS METHOD HAS BEEN PARTIALLY TESTED WITH LIVE FIRE DEPARTMENTS
