TaPe and CD theft

   I have noticed their is not many text philez on stealing CDs, tapes etc.  
So I decided to write one.  So here it is.  I do this at Wal-mart.  Yes 
Wal-mart.  It's so eazy.

Materials:

1 Magnet (a real one, not a magnt from Pizza Hut)

2 Big Balls

Powerful hands (or a phriend)

How to do it:

   First walk STRAIGHT to tha tape section.  Tha less they see of you tha 
better.  Then find a nice CD or tape.  Here is my list:

Gone Jackels
NiN (Nine Inch Nails)
Rage Agaist the Machine
Bush

   Then take tha CD (or tape) outta tha electronics section.  Walk around 
quick.  I suggest you come tha day befoe and look foe a place where there 
are not any camreas (Black domes or panels on tha ceiling).  I use tha 
bathroom.  Then press tha plastic away from you.  Let me show you:

 ___________
/           \
|           |
|           |  <---Tape there
|           |
-------------
|           | >\  Plastic
|           | >/   Thing
-------------
|           |
|           | <---Space (opened area)
\___________/

   Now flip it around.  Press tha pastic thing away from you.  Then it 
should pop off.  Pull tha CD (or tape) out.  You should see a bar-code thing 
on it.  Just take tha magnet and rub it on it a few times.  Then press it on 
tha ground.  Now you can walk out with it.  Have phun!!!

   DDDDDISCLAIMERRRRR

   First off, I take no responsablitiy foe your actions.  Second, this is 
illegal.  So don't do it.  If this part is taken out and then spread, I'm 
still not responasble.  I put this in here and if it is spread without it, 
not my fault.  C-ya l8erz.
