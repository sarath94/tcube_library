   You would be surprised how many files are out that use what falls under the
 category of a "fuse". They assume you just have a few lying around, or know
 where to get them. Well, in some parts of the country,fuses are extremely hard
 to come by...so this part of our first file is dedicated to fuses. Both are
 very simple to make, and are fairly reliable:


        Slow Burning Fuse (2 in. per minute approx.)
        =================

  Materials needed:
    ---> cotton string or 3 shoelaces
    ---> potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
    ---> granulated sugar

  Procedure:
    1. wash the cotton string or shoelaces in HOT soapy water, then rinse
       with fresh water.

    2. mix the following together in a glass bowl:
        1 part potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
        1 part granulated sugar
        2 parts hot water

    3. Soak strings or shoelaces in this solution.

    4. Twist/braid 3 strands together and allow them to dry.

    5. Check burn rate to see how long it actually takes.

 note: the few inches of this fuse to be inserted into the explosive device
       must be coated with a black-powder paste to ensure its reliability.



        Fast Burning Fuse (40 in. per minute)
        =================

  Materials needed:
         ---> soft cotton string
         ---> fine black powder
         ---> shallow dish or pan

  Procedure:
         1. moisten powder to form a paste
         2. twist/braid 3 strands of cotton together
         3. rub paste into string and allow to dry
         4. check burn rate

       +    1. punch holes on the inside bottom of the bucket, so that    +
       +       the metal is "puckerd" outward from the bottom             +
       +    2. spread cloth over holes in bottom                          +
       +    3. place wood ash on cloth; spread it out so that it covers   +
       +       the entire cloth and has about the same thickness          +
       +    4. place 2nd cloth on top of the wood ashes                   +
       +    5. place the dirt or other material in the bucket             +
       +    6. place bucket over shallow container (note: it may need     +
       +       supports on the bottom so the drain holes are not blocked) +
       +    7. boil water and pour it over the earth very slowly. Do NOT  +
       +       pour it all at once, as this will clog the filter on the   +
       +       bottom                                                     +

       +   10. allow water in dish to cool for an hour or so              +
       +   11. carefully drain the liquid in the dish away, and discard   +
       +       the sludge in the bottom                                   +
       +   12. boil this liquid over a fire for at least 2 hours. Small   +
       +       grains of salt will form - scoop these out with the paper  +
       +       as they form                                               +

       +   14. after 1/2 hour add equal volume of the alcohol; when this  +
       +       mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals      +
       +       appear. This is the potassium nitrate.                     +

            ones if they are very,very!        insert into a socket frequently
            small glass objects.)     !        used by the intended victim...
       ---> pack of matches           !
       ---> 1 candle                  ! When the victim flips the switch,
                                      ! they're in for a BIG SURPRISE!
  Procedure:                          !________________________________________
     1. light the candle and allow a large pool of molten wax to form in the
        top.
     2. take a single match and hold the glass part of a single diode against
        the head....bend the wires around the head so that one wraps in an
        upward direction and then sticks out to the side...do the same with
        the other wire, but in a down ward direction. The diode should now be
        hugging the match head, but its wires MUST NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER!!!!
     3. dip the match head in wax to give it a water-proof coat (these work
        under water)
     4. repeat steps 1 - 3 to make as many as you want
  
  How to use:
    When these little dudes are hooked across a 6vDC battery, the diode reaches
  what is called break-down voltage. When most electrical components reach this
  voltage, they usually produce great ammounts of heat and light, while quickly
  melting into a little blob. This heat is enough to ingite a match head. These
  are recomended for use under water, where most other ingniters refuse to
  work. Enjoy!

                             HOME-BREW BLAST CANON           
                             =====================

  Materials:
     ---> 1 plastic drain pipe, 3 feet long, at least 3 1/2 inches in diameter
     ---> 1 smaller plastic pipe, about 6 inches long, 2 inches in diameter
     ---> 1 large lighter, w/ fluid refills (this gobbles it up)
     ---> 1 pipe cap to fit the large pipe, 1 pipe cap to fit the smaller pipe
     ---> 5 feet of bell wire
     ---> 1 SPST rocker switch
     ---> 1 6v polaroid potapulse battery
     ---> 1 5v relay (get this at radio shack)
     ---> electrical tape
     ---> one free afternoon

  Procedure:
     1.  cut the bell wire into 3 equal pieces, and strip the ends
     2.  cut a hole in the side of the large pipe, the same diameter as the
         small pipe; thread the hole and one end of the small pipe. They should
         screw together easily.
     3.  take a piece of scrap metal, and bend it into an "L" shape, then
         attach it to the lever on the lighter like so:
                           /----------- gas switch is here
                 ________  V
                /        \__-----\
                ! lighter   !    !  <--- metal lever
                !           !    !
                !           !
          Now, every time you pull the "trigger", gas should flow freely from
          the lighter; you may need to enlarge the "gas port" on the lighter,
          if you wish to be able to fire more rapidly.
      4.  connect 2 wires to the two posts on the switch
      5.  cut to holes in the side of the smaller tube, one for the switch on
          the bottom, and one for the metal piece on top; then mount the switch
          in the bottom, running the wires up and out the top; mount the 
          lighter/trigger in the top; now the switch should rock easily, and
          the trigger should cause the lighter to pour out gas. Re-screw the
          smaller tube into the larger one, hold own the trigger a bit, let it
          go, and throw a match in there; if all goes well, you should get a
          nice big "THUD!"
      6.  get hold of the relay, and take off the top:

                     1  ----------+
                                  V
                                 _/
                     2  --------/      <---- the center object is the metal
                                  ^          finger inside the relay
                     3  ----------+

                                CC
                                OO -------- 4
                                II
                                LL -------- 5
 
 Guide to Civilian Warfare and Sabotage                           page: 5

           Connect (1) to one of the wires comming from the switch; connect
           (2) to (4), and connect (5) to one side of the battery; connect the
           remaining wire from the switch to the other side of the battery;
           now you should be able to get the relay to make a little "buzzing"
           sound when you flip the switch and you should see some tiny little
           sparks.
       7.  now, carefully mount the relay on the inside of the large pipe,
           towards the back; screw on the smaller pipe; tape the battery to
           the side of the canon barrel (yes, but looks arent everything)
       8.  you should now be able to let a little gas into the barrel and
           set it off by flipping the switch.
       9.  put the cap on the back end of the large pipe VERY SECURELY. You
           are now ready for the first trial-run.

  To Test:

       Put something very very large into the barrel, just so that in fits
    "just right". Now, find a strong guy (the recoil will probably knock you
    over if you arent careful). Put on a shoulder pad, and earmuffs, and 
    possibly some other protective clothing. Hold the trigger down for 30
    seconds, hold on tight, and hit the switch. With luck and the proper
    adjustments, you should be able to put a frozen orange through 1/4 plywood
    at 25 feet. Have phun!
