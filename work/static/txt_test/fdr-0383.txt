THE CHEMIST'S CORNER ARTICLE #1: EXPLOSIVES
BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG

THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING SOME DANGEROUS
EXPLOSIVES. IF YOU INTEND TO MAKE ANY OF THESE EXPLOSIVES, DO SO IN
SMALL AMOUNTS ONLY, AS THEY ARE ALL DANGEROUS AND COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE
OR KILL YOU IF DONE IN LARGER AMOUNTS. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
CHEMISTRY, DON'T DO THESE EXPERIMENTS! I AM NOT JOKING IN GIVING THIS
WARNING. UNLESS YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH, YOU SHOULDN'T TRY ANY OF THE
FOLLOWING UNLESS YOU HAVE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH CHEMICALS. I AM NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INJURY OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY PEOPLE USING THIS
INFORMATION. IT IS PROVIDED FOR USE BY PEOPLE KNOWLEDGABLE IN CHEMISTRY
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS AND CAN SAFELY HANDLE SUCH
EXPERIMENTS.

===============================================================================


I. COMMON "WEAK" EXPLOSIVES.

   A. GUNPOWDER: 75% POTASSIUM NITRATE 15% CHARCOAL 10% SULFUR

      THE CHEMICALS SHOULD BE GROUND INTO A FINE POWDER (SEPERATELY!)
WITH A MORTER & PESTLE. IF GUNPOWDER IS IGNITED IN THE OPEN, IT BURNS
FIERCELY, BUT IF IN A CLOSED SPACE IT BUILDS UP PRESSURE FROM THE
RELEASED GASES AND CAN EXPLODE THE CONTAINER. GUNPOWDER WORKS LIKE THIS:
THE POTASSIUM NITRATE OXIDIZES THE CHARCOAL AND SULFUR, WHICH THEN BURN
FIERCELY. CARBON DIOXIDE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE ARE THE GASES RELEASED.

   B. AMMONAL:

      AMMONAL IS A MIXTURE OF AMMONIUM NITRATE (A STRONG OXIDIZER)
WITH ALUMINUM POWDER (THE 'FUEL' IN THIS CASE). I AM NOT SURE OF THE %
COMPOSITION FOR AMMONAL, SO YOU MAY WANT TO EXPERIMENT A LITTLE USING
SMALL AMOUNTS.

   C. CHEMICALLY IGNITED EXPLOSIVES:

      1. A MIXTURE OF 1 PART POTASSIUM CHLORATE TO 3 PARTS TABLE SUGAR
(SUCROSE) BURNS FIERCELY AND BRIGHTLY (SIMILAR TO THE BURNING OF
MAGNESIUM) WHEN 1 DROP OF CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID IS PLACED ON IT.
WHAT OCCURS IS THIS: WHEN THE ACID IS ADDED IT REACTS WITH THE POTASSIUM
CHLORATE TO FORM CHLORINE DIOXIDE, WHICH EXPLODES ON FORMATION, BURNING
THE SUGAR AS WELL.

      2. USING VARIOUS CHEMICALS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A MIXTURE THAT WORKS
VERY WELL FOR IMITATING VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. I HAVE GIVEN IT THE NAME
'MPG VOLCANITE' (TM). HERE IT IS: POTASSIUM CHLORATE + POTASSIUM
PERCHLORATE + AMMONIUM NITRATE + AMMONIUM DICHROMATE + POTASSIUM NITRATE
+ SUGAR + SULFUR + IRON FILINGS + CHARCOAL + ZINC DUST + SOME COLORING
AGENT. (SCARLET= STRONTIUM NITRATE, PURPLE= IODINE CRYSTALS, YELLOW=
SODIUM CHLORIDE, CRIMSON= CALCIUM CHLORIDE, ETC...).

      3. SO, DO YOU THINK WATER PUTS OUT FIRES? IN THIS ONE, IT STARTS IT.
MIXTURE: AMMONIUM NITRATE + AMMONIUM CHLORIDE + IODINE + ZINC DUST. WHEN
A DROP OR TWO OF WATER IS ADDED, THE AMMONIUM NITRATE FORMS NITRIC ACID
WHICH REACTS WITH THE ZINC TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN AND HEAT. THE HEAT
VAPORIZES THE IODINE (GIVING OFF PURPLE SMOKE) AND THE AMMONIUM CHLORIDE
(BECOMES PURPLE WHEN MIXED WITH IODINE VAPOR). IT ALSO MAY IGNITE THE
HYDROGEN AND BEGIN BURNING. AMMONIUM NITRATE: 8 GRAMS AMMONIUM CHORIDE:
1 GRAM ZINC DUST: 8 GRAMS IODINE CRYSTALS: 1 GRAM

      4. POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE + GLYCERINE WHEN MIXED PRODUCES A
PURPLE-COLORED FLAME IN 30 SECS-1 MIN. WORKS BEST IF THE POTASSIUM
PERMANGANATE IS FINELY GROUND.

      5. CALCIUM CARBIDE + WATER RELEASES ACETYLENE GAS (HIGHLY
FLAMMABLE GAS USED IN BLOW TORCHES...)

II. THERMITE REACTION.

   THE THERMITE REACTION IS USED IN WELDING, BECAUSE IT GENERATES
MOLTEN IRON AND TEMPERATURES OF 3500 C (6000F+). IT USES ONE OF THE
PREVIOUS REACTIONS THAT I TALKED ABOUT TO START IT!

   STARTER=POTASSIUM CHLORATE + SUGAR MAIN PT.= IRON (III) OXIDE +
ALUMINUM POWDER (325 MESH OR FINER)

   PUT THE POTASSIUM CHLORARE + SUGAR AROUND AND ON TOP OF THE MAIN PT.
TO START THE REACTION, PLACE ONE DROP OF CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID ON
TOP OF THE STARTER MIXTURE. STEP BACK! THE RATIOS ARE: 3 PARTS IRON(III)
OXIDE TO 1 PART ALUMINUM POWDER TO 1 PART POTASSIUM CHLORATE TO 1 PART
SUGAR. WHEN YOU FIRST DO IT, TRY 3G:1G:1G:1G! ALSO, THERE IS AN
ALTERNATIVE STARTER FOR THE THERMITE REACTION. THE ALTERNATIVE IS
POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE + GLYCERINE. AMOUNTS: 55G IRON(III) OXIDE, 15G
ALUMINUM POWDER, 25G POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE, 6ML GLYCERINE.

III. NITROGEN-CONTAINING HIGH EXPLOSIVES.

   A. MERCURY(II) FULMINATE TO PRODUCE MERCURY(II) FULMINATE, A VERY
SENSITIVE SHOCK EXPLOSIVE, ONE MIGHT ASSUME THAT IT COULD BE FORMED BY
ADDING FULMINIC ACID TO MERCURY. THIS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT SINCE
FULMINIC ACID IS VERY UNSTABLE AND CANNOT BE PURCHASED. I DID SOME
RESEARCH AND FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT WITHOUT FULMINIC ACID. YOU ADD
2 PARTS NITRIC ACID TO 2 PARTS ALCOHOL TO 1 PART MERCURY. THIS IS
THEORETICAL (I HAVE NOT YET TRIED IT) SO PLEASE, IF YOU TRY THIS, DO IT
IN VERY* SMALL AMOUNTS AND TELL ME THE RESULTS.

   B. NITROGEN TRIIODIDE NITROGEN TRIIODIDE IS A VERY POWERFUL AND VERY
SHOCK SENSITIVE EXPLOSIVE. NEVER STORE IT AND BE CARFUL WHEN YOU'RE
AROUND IT- SOUND, AIR MOVEMENTS, AND OTHER TINY THINGS COULD SET IT OFF.

   MATERIALS- 2-3G IODINE 15ML CONC. AMMONIA 8 SHEETS FILTER PAPER 50ML
BEAKER FEATHER MOUNTED ON A TWO METER POLE EAR PLUGS TAPE SPATULA
STIRRING ROD

   ADD 2-3G IODINE TO 15ML AMMONIA IN THE 50ML BEAKER. STIR, LET STAND
FOR 5 MINUTES. DO THE FOLLOWING WITHIN 5 MINUTES! RETAIN THE SOLID,
DECANT THE LIQUID (POUR OFF THE LIQUID BUT KEEP THE BROWN  SOLID...).
SCAPE THE BROWN RESIDUE OF NITROGEN TRIIODIDE ONTO A STACK OF FOUR
SHEETS OF FILTER PAPER. DIVIDE SOLID INTO FOUR PARTS, PUTTING EACH ON A
SEPERATE SHEET OF DRY FILTER PAPER. TAPE IN POSITION, LEAVE TO DRY
UNDISTURBED FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES (PREFERRABLY LONGER). TO DETONATE,
TOUCH WITH FEATHER. (WEAR EAR PLUGS WHEN DETONATING OR COVER EARS- IT IS
VERY LOUD!)

   C. CELLULOSE NITRATE (GUNCOTTON)

   COMMONLY KNOWN AS SMOKELESS POWDER, NITROCELLULOSE IS EXACTLY THAT-
IT DOES NOT GIVE OFF SMOKE WHEN IT BURNS.

   MATERIALS- 70ML CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID 30ML CONCENTRATED NITRIC
ACID 5G ABSORBENT COTTON 250ML 1M SODIUM BICARBONATE 250ML BEAKER ICE
BATH TONGS PAPER TOWELS

   PLACE 250ML BEAKER IN THE ICE BATH, ADD 70ML SULFURIC ACID, 30 ML
NITRIC ACID. DIVIDE COTTON INTO .7G PIECES. WITH TONGS, IMMERSE EACH
PIECE IN THE ACID SOLUTION FOR 1 MINUTE. NEXT, RINSE EACH PIECE IN 3
SUCCESSIVE BATHS OF 500ML WATER. USE FRESH WATER FOR EACH PIECE. THEN
IMMERSE IN 250ML 1M SODIUM BICARBONATE. IF IT BUBBLES, RINSE IN WATER
ONCE MORE UNTIL NO BUBBLING OCCURS. SQUEEZE DRY AND SPREAD ON PAPER
TOWELS TO DRY OVERNIGHT.

   D. NITROGLYCERINE

   NITROGLYCERINE IS A *VERY* DANGEROUS SHOCK SENSITIVE EXPLOSIVE. IT IS
USED IN MAKING DYNAMITE, AMONG OTHER THINGS. I AM NOT SURE AS TO THE
PROPORTIONS AND AMOUNTS OF CHEMICALS TO BE USED, SO I SHALL USE
ESTIMATES.

   MATERIALS- 70ML CONC. SULFURIC ACID 30ML CONC. NITRIC ACID 10 ML
   GLYCERINE ICE BATH 150ML BEAKER

   PUT THE 150ML BEAKER IN THE ICE BATH AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS VERY
COLD. SLOWLY ADD THE 70ML SULFURIC AND 30ML NITRIC ACIDS TO THE BEAKER,
TRYING TO MAINTAIN A LOW TEMPERATURE. WHEN THE TEMPERATURE STARTS TO
LEVEL OFF, ADD ABOUT 10ML GLYCERINE. IF IT TURNS BROWN OR LOOKS FUNNY,
**RUN LIKE HELL**. WHEN NITROGLYCERINE TURNS BROWN, THAT MEANS IT'S
READY TO EXPLODE... IF IT STAYS CLEAR AND ALL WORKS WELL, KEEP THE
TEMPERATURE AS LOW AS YOU CAN AND LET IT SIT FOR A FEW HOURS. YOU THEN
SHOULD HAVE SOME NITROGLYCERINE, PROBABLY MIXED WITH NITRIC AND SULFURIC
ACIDS. WHEN YOU SET IT OFF, YOU MUST NOT BE NEARBY. NITROGLYCERINE CAN
FILL 10,000 TIMES ITS ORIGINAL AREA WITH EXPANDING GASES. THIS MEANS
THAT IF YOU HAVE 10ML'S OF NITROGLYCERINE IN THERE, IT WILL PRODUCE SOME
100,000ML'S OF GASES. TO MAKE IT INTO DYNAMITE, THE NITROGLYCERINE MUST
BE ABSORBED INTO SOMETHING LIKE WOOD PULP OR DIAMAECEOUS EARTH (SPELLED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT).


IV. OTHER STUFF

   A. PEROXYACETONE

   PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE
SHOCK SENSITIVE.

   MATERIALS- 4ML ACETONE 4ML 30% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE 4 DROPS CONC.
HYDROCHLORIC ACID 150MM TEST TUBE

   ADD 4ML ACETONE AND 4ML HYDROGEN PEROXIDE TO THE TEST TUBE. THEN ADD
4 DROPS CONCENTRATED HYDROCHLORIC ACID. IN 10-20 MINUTES A WHITE SOLID
SHOULD BEGIN TO APPEAR. IF NO CHANGE IS OBSERVED, WARM THE TEST TUBE IN
A WATER BATH AT 40 CELSIUS. ALLOW THE REACTION TO CONTINUE FOR TWO
HOURS. SWIRL THE SLURRY AND FILTER IT. LEAVE OUT ON FILTER PAPER TO DRY
FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS. TO IGNITE, LIGHT A CANDLE TIED TO A METER STICK
AND LIGHT IT (WHILE STAYING AT LEAST A METER AWAY).

   B. SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE...

   THE FOLLOWING REACTION SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR AMOUNT OF SMOKE. SINCE
THIS REACTION IS NOT ALL THAT DANGEROUS YOU CAN USE LARGER AMOUNTS IF
NECESSARY FOR LARGER AMOUNTS OF SMOKE.

   6G ZINC POWDER 1G SULFUR POWDER

   INSERT A RED HOT WIRE INTO THE PILE, STEP BACK. A LOT OF SMOKE SHOULD
BE CREATED.




THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXPERIMENTS I COULD HAVE INCLUDED, BUT I WILL SAVE
THEM FOR THE NEXT CHEMIST'S CORNER ARTICLE. UPCOMING ARTICLES WILL
INCLUDE GLOW-IN-THE-DARK REACTIONS, 'PARTY' REACTIONS, THINGS YOU CAN DO
WITH HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS, AND MORE...

I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE CREDIT TO A BOOK BY SHAKASHARI ENTITLED "CHEMICAL
DEMONSTRATIONS" FOR A FEW OF THE PRECISE AMOUNTS OF CHEMICALS IN SOME
EXPERIMENTS.

THIS IS IT FOR CHEMIST'S CORNER #1...
LOOK FOR CHEMIST'S CORNER #2: WHAT TO DO WITH HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS...
