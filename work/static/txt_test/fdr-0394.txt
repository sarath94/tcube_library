                       >>>>>> C02 Cartridge Bombs <<<<<<

     You will have to use up the new cartridge by either shooting it in a C02
B-B gun or use it in a C02 car or whatever else you might figure out to do
with it.  With a nail, force the hole bigger so as to allow the powder and
wick to fit in easily.  Fill the cartridte with black powder and pack it in
there real good by tapping the bottom of the cartridge on a hard surface.
Insert a fuse (I recommend good waterproof cannon fuse, but I've used fire-
cracker fuses.)  Light it and run!!!  It does wonders for a row of mail boxes.
Be careful however, this little beauty throws shrapnel and can be quite a
hazard.

                         >>>>>>Thermite Bombs<<<<<<

     The first step in the construction of a thermite bomb is to get some
iron-oxide (rust). Here is a good way to make large quantities in a short
time:  First you will need a DC converter which can be found on a race track
or train track.  Cut the connector off, separate the two wires, and strip them
both.  You will secondly need a jar of water which has been diluted with salt
to make the water a conductor (use about a tablespoon.)  Then insert both
wires into the solution and determine which bubbles the most.  You then need
to tie a common iron nail to the one that bubbles the most (The positive wire).
If you don't you will get the opposite of rust...Rust acid!  Put the nail tied
to the positive wire and the negative wire in the jar on opposite sides until
they are both completely submerged.  Let that set over night and then remove the
(crusty) stuff off the nail and remove the wires.  Let this set until a
sufficient amount of the crust is at the bottom.  Remove the excess water and
pour the crusty solution in a cookie sheet and let it dry out in the sun for a
couple of hours, or over night.  It should be an orange-brown color, though I've
had it many different colors. Crush the rust into a fine powder and heat it in a
cast iron pot until it's red. (I'm not sure what that does.)

     Now mix the iron-oxide with pure aluminum filings which can be bought or
filed down by hand from an aluminum tube or bar.  The ratio should be 8 grams of
rust per 3 grams of aluminum. That's thermite!!!

     Now, to light it you must get some magnesium which is sorta hard to get
for me cause my hardware store don't have it.  I finally found that I could get
a perfect piece of magnesium ribbon from the chemistry lab! This ribbon is the
fuse of the bomb.  It takes the heat from the burning magnesium to light the
thermite...But to light the magnesium you need a blow torch (Don't worry, the
blow torch is not hot enough to light the thermite).  Well keep your thermite in
a bag and then when you see an innocent car...Pour a small amount of thermite on
the wood, stick a length of magnesim in it and then light the magnesium with the
blow torch and watch it burn right through the hood, the block, the axle, and
spark and flare on the pavement.  Be careful...The ideal mixtures can vaporize
carbonized steel (Which is damn hot!) Have fun!

                          >>>>>>Touch Explosive<<<<<<

     This is sort of a mild explosive, but can be dangerous in large quantities.
To make touch explosive (Such as that found in a snap and pop, but more potent)
mix iodine crystals into ammonia until the iodine crystals will not dissolve
into the ammonia anymore. Let it set until you get a white precipitate at the
bottom...Pour off the excess ammonia and dry out the crystals the same way as
the thermite.  Be careful now cause these dried crystals are your touch
explosives!  I haven't found a good use for it yet, but it's fun to throw at
people or leave it in their chairs at school..It can get painful if applied
properly!

                            >>>>>>Letter Bombs<<<<<<

     You will first have to make a mild version of thermite as mentioned
above, however you will use just plain iron filings instead of rust.  Mix the
iron filing with the aluminm filings in a ratio of 75% aluminum with 25% iron.
This mixture will burn violently in an enclosed space (such as an envelope)
which brings us to the next ingredient.  Go to the post office or business
supply store and buy an insulated (padded) envelope.  The type that is double
layered.  Separate the layers and place the mild thermite in the main section,
where the letter would go.  Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer.
There's your bomb. Now to light it!

     This is the tricky part and is hard to explain in writing. Experiment
with this idea until you have got it right.  Ok, the fuse is just that touch
explosive placed where the letter would be torn open. You may want to wrap it
like a long cigarette and then place it at the top of the envelope in the outer
layer (on top of the powdered magnesium.)  When the touch explosive is torn or
even squeezed hard it will ignite the powdered magnesium (sort of a flashlight)
and then it will burn the mild thermite. I've never sent one of these so I don't
really know if it works good. I do know that the thermite burns real hot and if
it didn't blow up it would give some one a bad burn (Thermite does wonders on
human flesh!!)

                            >>>>>>Paint Bombs<<<<<<

     To make a paint bomb you simply need a metal can with a fastenable lid,
a nice bright color paint, and a quantity of dry ice.  Place the paint in the
can and then drop the dry ice in.  Quickly place the lid on tightly and then
run.  With some testing you can get it down so you have a timer that works on
how much ice you have compared with how much paint you have.  If you're really
pissed at someone, you could place it on their doorstep, knock on the door, and
then run!!!  Enough bombs....Let's work on cars.

                     >>>>>>Ways to Send A Car To Hell<<<<<<

     There are a thousand and one ways to destroy a car but I will only cover
those which are most fun and hardest to find out about.

     Place thermite on the hood as mentioned above, place burning magnesium on
the hood, tape a Co2 bomb to the (axle, hood, wheel, muffler, all), put a
tampon, dirt, sugar, a ping pong ball, just about anything) in the gas tank. Put
(Potatoes, bananas, rocks, or anything at all that will fit) in the exhaust
pipe. Put a long rag in the gas tank and catch it on fire (Run real far). Make a
jimmey and pick the lock and then steal the stereo....I'll try to draw a
picture...Cut one of those thin metal rulers int the pattern given below:

____________________________________________________    ____
                                                    |__|    \
sorta phallic huh?                                           |
                                                    |--|    /
----------------------------------------------------   ----

The important part are the notches on the sides which are used to pull up ^ on
the cable which pulls up the lock!  Get stereos, equalizers, rader detectors,
car guns, loose change and cassette tapes, and then destroy the inside (a knife
is handy for the seats.)

                           >>>>>>Hate school???<<<<<<

     One of my favorites for getting out of a class or two is to call in a bomb
threat...Tell them it's in a locker, then they have to check them all and that
takes an hour at our school. I've even placed a fake bomb in a locker (not
mine), called it in, and they called off school for the whole week!! (Little
did I know that we had to make it up during the summer).  Or you could get
some pure potassium or pure sodium, put it in a capsule and flush it down a
toilet. Use a smoke grenade in the cafeteria, halls or bathrooms.  Steal keys
off the school computers, steal the 80col cards inside, or any of the cards!
Put a large magnet on the monitors.  Make friends with student assistants in the
counseling office and have them change your grade when teachers hand in their
bubble sheets for the report cards.  Spit your gum out on the carpeted floor at
school, and watch the janitors cry. Draw on lockers or write on the building
that the principal is a fascist. Ours offerereed a $100 reward after I did
that!!  I wanted to turn myself in!!  Use your imagination!

                      >>>>>>Phone Related Vandalism<<<<<<

     If you live where there are underground lines then you will be able to
ruin someone's phone line very easily.  All you must do is go to their house and
find the green junction box that interfaces their line (and possibly some others
in the neighborhood) with the major lines.  These can be found just about
anywhere but they are usually underneath the nearest phone pole. Take a socket
wrench and loosen the nut on the right. Then just take clippers or a sledge
hammer or a bomb and destroy the insides and pull up their phone cable.. Cut it
into segments so it can't be fixed but must be replaced. There's a week of
work!!!  Or you can do my favorite, call them with a directory dialer for about
a week...They won't get another call besides yours for that entire week!  How
about calling the phone company and having it disconnected for a while, or have
their mail held for a month or two (Say you're going on vacation and give them
their address.)

                               >>>>>>Misc.<<<<<<

     How about going into Target and setting the alarms on the radios and
then crank the volume....Five minutes later.. while you are far away in
another part of the store....You hear radios cranked going off and people
frantically trying to turn it off..  Do some price switching, for yourself
or to get someone else in trouble.   Be creative.. There's always a way to be
obnoxious and annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
