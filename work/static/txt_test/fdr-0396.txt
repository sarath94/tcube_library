WARNING: Don't try this at home.  If you're stupid enough to try any of this
shit, we're not responsible.  We aren't gonna pay your hospital bills because
you blew off your thumb.  We'll just laugh at you.  WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR
ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY USE OF ANY OF THE MATERIAL PRESENTED IN THIS FILE.

WD bomb:
  Of all the cheap homemade bombs available, the WD bomb is one of the coolest.
  If you're lucky, you can even get a nice mushroom cloud with this bomb.
 Ingedients:
  1 FULL can of WD-40 (or any compressed flammable substance)
  1 tube of rubber cement
  1 lighter (or match)
  1 bb gun (can be reused)
  1 bb (can be reused if you're stupid enough to spend the time to find it)
 Directions:
  Put the WD can down on the ground.  Cover it with the rubber cement.  Or, if
  you're too cheap to use rubber cement, start a fire on and around it (a Chud
  variant is good for this.)  Then, light the rubber cement.  If you got the
  good kind of cement, it should burn well.  Now, get the hell away and shoot
  it with the bb gun.  See, we told you it ruled.

Chud:
  Chud is a simple long burning high heat small flame material.  It can be 
  used to replace rubber cement in the WD bomb.  Chud is the gas mixture,
  however, several different mixtures exist and are specifically named.  By
  the way, this shit is hard to put out.  I should know, I once kicked a
  mixture of this under someone's shed.
 Ingredients:
  2/3 flour
  1/3 flammable liquid
 Directions:
  Put the flour and flammable liquid in a cup.  Stir until the mixture has a
  dogh-like texture.  You may need to adjust the ratios of the flour and the
  flammable liquid.
 Flammable Liquids:
  As stated above, Chud has several variants.  The gas mixture (plain Chud) is
  recommended because of its high flammability and low cost.  However, in 
  certain cases Chud may not be the best mixture.  Here is a list of 
  substitutions for the gas:
   Gas - Chud
   Oil - Chug
   Anti-freeze - Chuff
   Anything else - Chuz

Works Bomb:
  Most everyone has heard of the Works (or hydrochloric acid) bomb.  Well, we
  figured we'd reprint it for the sake of those who don't know about it.  The
  Works bomb is just a simple pressure bomb.  You put two materials that 
  react with each other (in this case, hydrochloric acid and tin foil) in a
  container (in this case, a two liter bottle) and the pressure builds up 
  until the container makes a really big 'BOOOOOM.'  Someone I knew did this
  in a forest right next to a little league baseball team while they were
  practicing.  The bomb exploded and sounded so loud that the coach (from over
  100 yards away) thought it was a gun shot and had the little league players
  lay on the ground for 10 minutes.  Pretty realistic, huh?  Well, the problem
  is that you don't tell the bomb when to go off.  The bomb goes off when it
  damned well pleases (well actually when there's so much pressure in the
  container.)  So, you may have to do it a few times and try to get the same
  amounts of tin foil and Works in the bottle to get an estmate of the time
  it takes (usually greater than 5 minutes.)
 Ingredients:
  1 plastic two liter bottle (gets blown to shreds)
  some amount of hydrochloric acid (Works toilet bowl cleaner)
  some amount of tin foil
 Directions:
  Put the tin foil in the bottle.  Then, pour the Works into the two liter and
  get the cap on as quickly as possible.  Don't be afraid, you have a little
  while to run.  As I said above, you will have to play around with the 
  amounts of tin foil and Works you use.  Generally, don't fill the bottle 
  over 1/3 with the combination of both.  Don't stand within 15 feet when it
  goes off.  I heard of someone blowing off thier hand by holding one of
  these (there are some real dumbasses, aren't there?)

Liquid Nitrogen Bomb:
  The Liquid Nitrogen bomb is simply a varient of the Works bomb.  For those
  that don't know, liquid nitrogen is that really cold shit (like 74 degrees
  Kelvin.)  You can get it at most Chemistry labs.  The bomb explodes because
  as the Liquid Nitrogen warms up, it gets bigger until there's enough
  pressure to blow up the bottle.  The Liquid Nitrogen bomb is probably the
  coolest pressure bomb easily available.
 Ingredients:
  1 plastic two liter bottle
  a little less than 2 liters of liquid nitrogen
 Directions:
  Put the liquid nitrogen in the bottle.  Close the top real tight.  Run like
  hell.  It should take about 5-15 minutes for the bomb to go off.

Dry Ice Bomb:
  The Dry Ice bomb is yet another variation of the Works bomb.
 Ingredients:
  1 plastic two liter bottle
  some dry ice
  some water
 Directions:
  Put the dry ice and water into the bottle.  Close the top really tight.
  Run like hell.  It should take a little while for the bomb to go off.
  
Molotov Cocktail:
  The Molotov Cocktail is a long range gasoline delivery system.  It also
  makes a very nice fire where ever it hits.  By the way, the people who
  wrote the CyberPunk 2020 RPG game thought Molotovs were so cool, the
  combat rules for using them are listed on page 111 in the CyberPunk 2020
  rule book.
 Ingredients:
  1 glass bottle (MUST be glass)
  1 rag (a tampon is better if you can get one)
  1 lighter (or match)
  some duck tape (the good kind)
  some gas (enough to fill the bottle)
 Directions:
  Fill the glass bottle with the gasoline.  Then, soak the rag (or tampon) in
  gasoline.  Fit the rag into the opening in the bottle.  Tape the rag there
  with the duck tape (that's why you need good duck tape.)  After you have  
  assembled the cocktail, light the rag (or tampon), throw it, and run the
  hell away.  See, we told you it ruled.

  Further issues to come....
