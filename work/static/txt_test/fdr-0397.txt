Smoke Bomb by Alpine Hacker:
  This recipe was witten by Alpine Kracker.  It originally appeared in 
  Phrack #6.  But, we thought it was appropriate for this newsletter. 
 Ingredients:
  Saltpetre (Potassium Nitrate)
  Sugar
  Alcohol (100% is best, but plain rubbing alcohol will work)
  Gunpowder (or some ground-up rocket engines)
  Matches (Get a box of 50 packs -they can be very useful.)
  Coffee can
  Cigarette
 Directions:
  Combine the sugar and saltpetre in a 3:1 ratio (Sugar:saltpetre) and heat
  over a low flame until the mixture has thoroughly melted together. (It will
  look like sticky white lumps when ready) You need to stir this continually
  while heating, and remove it from the flame at the very first sign of smoke. 
  I had a batch go off in my face once, and the workroom was filled with smoke 
  for a good half hour. It is easier and safer to work with smaller batches.
  Now, dump all of this "smoke powder" into a coffee can, add some match 
  heads, moisten it with a little alcohol, and add gunpowder until all the 
  smoke powder is coated. Now tape a cigarette between the match heads in an 
  unopened book.  Imbed the book into the mixture.
  Light the but, and walk casually away to find a nice alibi within 5 minutes.
 Notes:
  You should be able to find some Saltpeter in a local drug store.
  All of the gunpowder, match heads, and alcohol is simply to insure good
  ignition. You can omit them, but if you have them, mix them in for
  reliability's sake. For the fuse, you can either use the one listed, or 
  either some canon fuse, or a rocket igniter and an electrical system.
  A quarter pound of this stuff is supposed to fill a city block. I'm not 
  sure if that is accurate, but it sure fills a public bathroom nicely.

Movie Technique:
  Movies use a very simple method to create fog.  They get a whole lot of
  liquid nitrogen (that really cold shit) and put it in buckets where they
  want the fog.  The liguid nitrogen converts directly to a white fog-like
  gas.  You should be able to get liquid nitrogen at any well stocked
  chemistry lab in high school or college.

C & C Hellfire Mix:
  This is one of the kewlest flammable mixtures we know about.  It is derived
  from the fact that heated wax and gasoline will form a new substance when
  combined.  We call this substance the C & C Hellfire Mix.  We originally
  intended to use gun powder instead of the gas, but we've been too lasy to
  get some gun powder.  If you replace the gas with gun powder, please tell
  us how it works.  C & C Hellfire Mix is basicly just highly flammable wax.
 Ingredients:
  Candle Wax
  Gasoline
  Microwave
  Glass Jar
 Directions:
  Put the candle wax in the jar.  Heat the jar in the microwave.  It takes me
  about 15 minutes to heat the wax to a liquid state in the microwave.  You
  an use a flame to do it faster, but I find the microwave more conenient.
  Then, when the wax is in a liquid state, mix some gasoline in.  The exact
  ratio of gas to wax is up to you.  Obviously, the more gas you put in, the
  bigger fire you'll get and the less easily it will harden.  It depends on
  what you want to do with the Hellfire Mix.  Well anyway, stir the mixture
  after you add the gas.  Then, do whatever yer gonna do with it.
 Substitutions for the gasoline:  
  We assume C & C Hellfire Mix works with just about any flammable substance.  
  However, we've only tried it with gas and rubber cement.  If you try it with
  other substances please let us know.  Most liquids should work just like
  gas though.  Rubber cement is one of the more interesting combinations.
  It creates a sticky flammble wax.  However, it doesn't compare to gas for
  flammability.
 Uses for C & C Hellfire Mix:
  Wicks - make wicks with it.  Get a string and make some Hellfire Mix.  When
   the mixture is still liquid, dip the string in.  The string will become
   coated with the mixture.  Only one or two dips though, it doesn't work well
   with more.  For this use, there should be a high gas to wax ratio.
  Explosive Candles - Yes, you can make candles out of C & C Hellfire Mix.
   Give them to your favorite relatives as gifts.  Start out just like wicks,
   but dip the string in a lot more.  For this use, your gonna need a tall
   thin pot.  This will allow you to keep the candle straight.  You may need 
   to keep the mix warm so it doesn't turn to a solid on you.
  Sterno substitute - C & C Hellfire Mix will even replace sterno.  Take a
   used sterno can (or some other can) and pour the Hellfire Mix into it.
   Then, let the mix cool.  It should form a solid substance.  When you try
   to light it, it may take a second but after that stand back.
  Molotov Cocktails - Can you replace the gasoline in Molotovs with C & C
   Hellfire Mix?  Well, sorta.  It won't explode as cool and it might cool to
   a solid before you throw it.  And, it's more expensive and harder to get
   than gasoline.  But, if you want to make a Molotov with Hellfire Mix go
   ahead.  Just don't blame us if it sucks.

Pin the Rocket on the Moron:
  On the lighter side, here's a fun little game for all of you to play.  
  Please rememeber, if you get hurt it ain't our fault.  Okay, now that we
  warned you here's the game.
 Object:
  Shoot little rockets at a moron running around in a field (or forest or
  swamp or nuclear waste dump.)  Whenever someone hits him, he loses.
  Whenever he successfully dodges a rocket, he wins.  But, winning doesn't
  mean shit.
 Materials:
  1 metal pipe
  1 lighter
  lot of little rockets
 Directions:
  You can get about six little rockets from one firework if you buy the right
  one.  Put the rockets in the pipe (which is on the aimer's shoulder.)  Then,
  have the ignitor (the person behind the aimer) light the rockeet with the
  lighter.  It should come shooting out of the pipe.
 Notes:
  Yes believe it or not, this game HAS been tested.  Of course, the moron
  running around in the field didn't really consent, but that doesn't matter.
