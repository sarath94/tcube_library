Welcome to yet another Ultra file. I have heard some comments about some files
we have released in the past. I want to clear this up before Ultra puts out any
more files. We are not a hack group. We are not a phreak group. There are just
to damn many of those out there already. I am sick of seeing cheap text files
stolen and rehashed then released claiming to be original. Fuckin pussies can't
even think up something original. Fuck all loser groups who steal from others
cause they suck.

If Ultra happens to come across FRESH information on a computer hacking or
phone phreaking topic we will turn it into an article, but thats not our main
goal. We want to be fucking evil as hell and stimulate your mind into thinking
about things most pussies consider wrong. I want to write a file to make the
hair raise up on the back of your fucking neck when you realize that we are
fucking sick and need to be put away.

Well if it feels good do it. If you go to church every sunday and it gets your
rocks off good. If you like to take rusty razor blades and slit a bitches
throat while you are fucking her where her eyeball used to be go for it.

Neighborhood Terrorism Made Easy.

   So it's now summertime and you need something to do since you don't have
school in the morning. Here are some fun and interesting things you can do to
entertain yourself over the summer.

1) Zip Strip - also know as strip ez, paint remover, and many other names.
   Take a can either a half gallon or so and find your worst enemies car.
   Carefully slosh this shit all over the bumpers if it's a newer model.
   This will melt the plastic within a few hours time and fuck the car up.
   Take some and concentrate it on the top of the wheels. Make sure to get a
   good amount. This will also eat through the tires. Whatever you have left
   throw across the hood and roof or even paint designs on the car. It is best
   to by the expensive paste it works better and the results are outstanding.
   Cheap paint remover is not strong enough to melt the car. Do not drive by
   and try throwing this shit out of your window. It will spray back and fuck
   your car up as well. Walk to the car and do this.

2) Water Balloons - yeah so what? Have you ever been really smacked by a water
   balloon? It hurt right? Well fill a bunch up and place then in a cooler or
   bucket and hop in the old automobile. Cruise around and find tragets to
   throw from a moving car. Like for example the fucking brats down the street
   who are fucking losers. Tag one of the up side the head at 35 miles an hour
   and watch them do a back flip from the impact. Speed up to 70 for a return
   hit and put them out of action for good. Next move on to a busy street and
   aim for open car windows. I busted a fat bitch in the head once and she
   wrecked her car into a brick mailbox. I almost died laughing at her. I know
   she shit her panties. Those balloons feel like gunshots when you get up the
   right amount of speed. Save a few for dogs and cats and joggers. Anything
   that is alive and moving is an open target.

3) Cow tipping/Bum tipping - this one has dual targets but that is because of
   different environments. In the city you have bums and homeless to fuck with.
   In the country you have farm animals. At night when you see a cow, horse or
   any animal asleep standing up get some people and run up and knock the
   stupid fucker over. The expression on their faces when they wake up and are
   halfway to the ground is unforgettable. I won't get into sheep fucking that
   is another file... now for the bums. Take a camera and drive around and take
   pictures of the fucking drunks and scum of the earth. Hell you could even
   package them all and sell them or something. I have seen photograph shows
   devoted to shots of the homeless. While you take their picture talk to them.
   Some of the bums are even bold enough to ask for money for taking their
   picture. I usually get mad and knock them out. Which brings me to the next
   set of things you can do with bums. Beat the fuck out of them. Try a
   baseball bat, your fist, hell anything will do. If you are under 21 and want
   some alcohol have a bum get it for you in return for something for himself.
   Beat his ass after he gets you a six pack. Fuck him up real good and he
   might die. One less bum to roam the street. Real loud now... BOO HOO!

4) BB Gun Fun - yeah all the kiddies have their red ryders packed away
   someplace safe. Well get that sucker out and prepare for fun. Hell the list
   of targets just begging to be tagged by a bb are endless. You can drive up
   and down the street for days shooting out windows. Car windows, picture
   windows, bay windows, store windows. Bus stops, street lights, porch lights,
   and even people make great targets. Most department stores sell air guns for
   under 50 bucks for some decent power. Anything shiny and breakable or
   anything moving or filled with blood is begging to be shot.

5) Rocks / Eggs / Tomatoes / etc. - one of the oldest forms or terror is
   stuff. Everyone has been egged or throw eggs. Well i just thought i would
   make sure you didn't forget it is still a very easily obtained method of
   destruction. I like tomatoes myself, they explode just right on the sides or
   cars and the sound is pure extasy. Plus is brings a great response from the
   driver. Usually death threats. I always wait until they turn around or stop
   and nail them a few extra times just for the hell of it before i split the
   scene.

6) Fireworks - yes the classic m80 in the mailbox. Well try a front porch that
   in recessed in the front of the house a few feet. This usually brings out
   a really good BANG and is always sure to piss someone off. Some well placed
   fire crackers in the dog house or back porch usually cause some fun also.
   For those with pools try the ones called jumping jacks. They go off
   underwater and sometime fly out of the pool adding to the effect. Next use
   bottle rockets for long distance assualts. These are good to launch over the
   house and bomb the people having a cookout or summer family reunion. If you
   really want to piss some people off use the whistling rockets in the middle
   of the night. They go for about 30 seconds and can be heard for miles.
   Try smoke bombs for causing wrecks. They are good placed in a tight curve
   where cars won't be able to see the smoke until they are right in it. You
   might also want to add obsticles or bomb the car as it slows down for the
   smoke with bottle rockets.

7) Traffic Detours - It is very easy to get a few of those orange dunce caps
   things and a few barricades and block off a section of the road. Detour
   traffic so as to cause a gridlock. Make them all go in circles or lead them
   back the same direction thet just came from. This will piss people off
   really bad. Set everything up at night so the morning rush hour gets the
   full effect. Use rope or something to secure them in place or some dumbass
   will get out of his car and move them to ruin the fun.

8) Trash Cans - My personal favorite. You need a driver and a co-pilot for this
   one. Find out when trash night is. Then prepare for some fun. Drive up to
   the plastic cans and have your friend lean out and grab ahold. Either drag
   it along side or if he is strong enough pick it up. Now you can pickup some
   speed and have him loosen the lid. Select a good target and let go. They
   make a nasty mess. Trash front lawns, streets, anything. On a good night i
   have taken every single plastic trash can out of my neighborhood and totally
   trashed a single persons yard. They had about 30 cans all across their front
   yard with trash everywhere. A note, metal ones will scratch your paint and
   are dangerous if you friend can't hold on they fuck the underside of your
   car up when you run them over. Only take plastic ones. The fancy ones on
   wheels are a blast. Get one of those suckers placed right and they will roll
   all the way down a driveway or to a front porch and crash, they tip over
   sending the contents dumping out. One note, trashcan owners get very pissed
   if they catch you in the act. I had some guy try to punch me as i drove off
   with his can. I pulled the lid off and did a captain america on his face
   with it and escaped.


Well i hope you enjoy these ideas. I will finish this file up in a few more
parts sometime in the near future. If you have something you want me to add i
will throw it in the next part of this series.
