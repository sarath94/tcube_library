                ULTRA # 13 - Breaking into houses - E-Z-N boxes
                              Written by Drug Lord

   May 11, 1991

   It has been a while since I have written a file, and that is because I
   couldn't think of anything.  So, I just started remember what kind of
   stuff I used to do (and still do).  The first thing I will teach you
   about are E-Z-N boxes.

   An E-Z-N box is a gold colored lock that is put on a house that is for
   sale.  It is put on there by the real estate agent.  Inside the box is
   the key to the front door.  The reason why they are put on the door knobs
   of houses is so that the real estate agents don't have to get the key in
   in order to show the house.  All the agent has to do is open the box up,
   get the key out, and open the door for their client.  All real estate
   agents have a key that opens the E-Z-N box.  Notice the initials of the
   lock and of course you should be able to figure out the meaning of it.
   If a house has an E-Z-N box, that means THE HOUSE IS VACANT!  The owner
   usually gets transferred, or moves into another house, so they take their
   belongings with them, and move on along.

   With this information you can do several things.  If the house is far
   away from neighbors, you could always try to break open the box, but I
   think that it would be a stupid idea because the boxes (locks) are cast
   iron, and it would take you a hell of a long time to get them open.
   Since the house is vacant, you can go in through the back.  Check all
   of the doors around the back of the house, and also check the windows
   to see whether or not they are locked.  I have found that many real
   estate agents forget about locking the doors back, etc.  This way you
   won't have to break a window, draw suspicion, and get the neighbors
   over there.  Just play it smart and don't throw a big rock at it from
   far away and make the fucking thing make a loud crash.

   Once you are inside the house, check all of the closets, drawers, etc.
   Even though the owner has moved, he often times leaves some shit behind
   to come back for later.  He also doesn't have to worry about getting
   his stuff stolen because the agent is supposed to be with the client at
   all times.  Hell, most stoves, refrigerators, and other shit stays as
   well, so if you feel brave enough to lug it out the back door, then
   more power to ya.  This is also a great place to party with some of
   your friends.  Once you are inside, you can unlock a certain bedroom
   window, so you can keep coming back.  They won't think to check all of
   the windows in the house.  I don't advise you coming back if you break
   out the window, because people and neighbors will be watching closer.
   Of course the night that you break in would be an excellent time to
   fuck your babe, or just rape a bitch off the street.  Needless to say,
   this should be done at night.  If you attempt this during the day, then
   you are just a plain dumb fuck.

   The later at night, the better.  If you go around 10:00 pm or so, then
   there is still a chance that the real estate agent could show the house
   therefore causing you some major shit.  This is especially true on the
   weekends because that is the time when most people go out looking for
   houses.  So go late at night during the week.  That's my suggestion.

                *-* HOW TO FIND A HOUSE WITH AN E-Z-N BOX *-*

   There are two ways of finding one.  The first way is to drive around to
   houses that are forsale, and just drive buy and look at the front door
   knob.  Look for the large gold box hanging from it.  Then, you will know
   if the house is vacant.  Also, on the FOR SALE sign outside, at the top
   many agents put a small sign on top of it with just the letters 'E-Z-N'
   or just 'EZN'.

   Another way is to call up some real estate agents and tell them that you
   are an agent with 'Century 21' (they are a national company, that is why
   I chose that name) and tell them that you would like to know if their
   office has any houses on E-Z-N boxes because one of your clients is in
   and out of town constantly due to his job, and you need to be able to
   show the house at a moments notice.  They will usually welcome the
   opportunity to help you, because they are on commission, and it would
   be to their advantage to get the house sold.  Try this with all the
   real estate companies you can locally.  Most companies will have branch
   offices, so be sure to call the branches as well.

                      *-* OTHER WAYS OF GETTING IN *-*

   After finding a house with an E-Z-N box, you could call up the agent and
   ask to see it.  Then when you are looking around, simply unlock a window
   when the agent isn't looking.  Then you come back later that night and
   open it up to get in.

   And last, but not least, if you have big balls and think that you are
   sly, you could try to steal the E-Z-N key from the real estate agent.
   It is NOT flat.  The part that you stick into the lock is a cylinder.
   Look at an E-Z-N box and you will see what I am talking about.  If
   you try this method, please e-mail me and let me know.  That would be a
   really good laugh.  I do believe the first ways are the easiest.

   Well, this concludes another ULTRA file.  See, this isn't just a bunch
   of bullshit that anyone can think of.  It is something that most people
   don't know about, therefore I have done my service to you by informing
   you of E-Z-N boxes.  No other group can kick ass like us.  Later on.
