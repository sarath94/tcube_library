Well, the group has been going for about 3 months now, and we are getting a lot
of positive mail about our files.  It is nice to hear that a lot of evil minds
exist out there.  I would like to thank Dredd for the idea for this file.

There are plenty of ways to scare the fuck out of someone.  The easiest way is
through physical violence.  Kicking their ass might just put them in their
place.  However, there are many times when you can fuck with someone's brain,
and do a hell of a lot more damage (plus they end up having to pay for therapy).
It depends on how you want to mentally fuck someone up.  Here are some key ways
of getting through.

First off, it isn't a good idea for the person to know who you are.  In other
words you don't want to do this shit to a girl you dumped the day before.  It
would be only SLIGHTLY obvious who was doing this.  You also want to always
keep out of sight and make sure that nothing can be traced back to you.  If
this person you are fucking with knows who you are, then they will just call
a pig and get your ass hauled in.

The most obvious thing to do would be the phone calls.  These would need to be
done from a pay-phone.  Make sure it is in a quiet place.  If you call from
your local mall, then it just ruins the moment.  Also, calling at night adds
that extra little "touch".  You don't want to say much.  Just say something
about how they are going to die.  Death of course is the scariest thing for
people to think about.  QUOTE FROM THE MOVIE HARD TO KILL:  "Anticipation of
death is worse than death itself".  This holds very true.  People are afraid
to die and this is the best way to screw with someone's mind.  Do not make a
lot of harassing phone calls, especially with the new features that the Bell
services have added.

Letters in the mail do a nice job too.  It goes without saying that you don't
put a fucking return address.  (If I didn't say that, then some 13 year old kid
would be crying when he got caught.  "But mommy...Drug Lord didn't TELL me not
to put a return address."  Anyway.  Make sure your handwriting won't be
recognized.  You can do the old trick by cutting out letters of words in
magazines and pasting them on a piece of paper, but that usually takes too long.
Hell, just type the message on your computer.  The lettering off of typewriters
can be traced so that they can tell which type of typewriter it came from.  You
shouldn't take any unnecessary risks.  In the letters you can say general stuff
like "How does it feel knowing your about to die?", and "You had better watch
your back, because you're about to die."

Then you can go for the family pet.  This is where the real mental torture
begins.  Many people would die without their pet.  The best way to kill their
pet is to take as much blood as you can.  If pooch is out in the dog-house (at
night of course), then offer the dog some food, and keep it quiet.  Then you
can either take a large knife and slice it's throat, or use a sledgehammer to
crush its skull.  The only problem is that the dog will probably yelp and
squeal.  Due to this, you can take pooch for a walk clear away from the house,
and just bring a trash bag to throw the dog into after you are through.  Now
what you do is you take a rope and make a noose.  Hang the dog by its neck
at the front or back door.  When they open the door to get some fresh morning
air, they will find their lovable pooch slaughtered.  You can even take some of
pooch's blood for future use, or you can use some of it to write messages on
the doors and the windows.  You can do this with rabbits (remember Fatal
Attraction), cats, and whatever lovable creatures that they have.  Hell, if you
have enough balls...hang their little brother or sister from the fucking porch.
Hehe, that would be a good one!

The idea is to terrorize your victim as much as possible.  You can do little
drive-bys where you can smash out windows in their houses with large rocks or
other things.  If you continue with this for a long time, you will eventually
be caught unless you are truely sly.  That is why it shouldn't last any more
than a week.  The calls from DIFFERENT phone booths, and the letters can
continue, but going near their house night after night would make you pretty
stupid.  Also try to find out where the people work.  Not just your victim,
but the others that live with this person.  Make some calls to where they
work, and make sure they know that you will find them no matter where they go.
Now you can take your extra blood and do a job on their car windows at work.
By this time, they will be scared shitless.  Feel free to use your own ideas
as well.  Just remember to be careful and not to let them know who you are.
That could cause some serious legal shit for you.  Have fun fucking with the
minds of others.

I, Drug Lord, am not responsible if people use these tactics to fuck with the
minds of others.  Hell, my mind is fucked as it is, so I don't have to worry.
