Probably the most frequently asked question in the world.

What the hell does 99 call mean.

I am a subway collector, and will imart some of the
information you require.

They don't even tell us all the codes by the way, only the
ones you need to know. Some of the rest you can figure out
or find out after you have been there a while. Anyway.

17 call....Any police officer in the system, call control.
25 call....A Subway Supplyman, The guy who supplies the collector
booths.
40.... a Platform Inspector
42.... a tower inspector
47.... a line inspector
48.... a subway security team call, by station or by "ZONE"
99.... a subway line mechanic, the guys who fix the trains.
71.... an RSEM tech
RSEM is revenue security equipment maintenence(tansfer Machines ECT.)

69....
69.... an escalator mechanic.

504 <Station Name>....A Janitor
sorry thats 506 for a janitor
504 is a janitors foreman. Followed by initials. ie: 504 G
is a foreman named Grant etc.

505 is a spare janitor, works several stations doing major work.
508 is a power washer. The guys with the floor scrubbing machines.
721 is a track crew. For work at track level.
if a code is appended with E it is Emergency IE 71E call 71E
