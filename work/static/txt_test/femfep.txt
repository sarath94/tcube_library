    Field Expedient Methods for Explosives Preparation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Preparation of Lead Picrate

Lead picrate is used as a primary explosive in the fabrication of
detonators. It is to be used with a booster explosive such as picric acid
or RDX.

MATERIAL REQUIRED (For 1 detonator):

Litharge (lead monoxide) (field prepared; also is used in plumbing and
	 ceramic cements)
Picric acid (field prepared)
Wood alcohol (methanol) (some antifreezers and paint removers)
Wooden or plastic rod
Dish or saucer (china or glass)
Teaspoon

PROCEDURE:

1. Weigh out 2 grams (or equal amounts) by weight of picric
   acid and lead monoxide.
2. Add the picric acid to 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) of
   methanol in a container (dish or saucer) and stir.
3. Add lead monoxide and stir.
4. Continue stirring and allow the alcohol to evaporate.
   NOTE: The mixture will suddenly thicken.
5. Carefully break up this mixture ad stir occasionally until
   a powder is formed (a few lumps will remain).
6. Remove and spread out to air dry. NOTE: If possible, dry
   at 100 degrees C (212 F) for two hours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 Preparation of Picric Acid from Aspirin

Picric acid can be used as a booster explosive in detonators or as an
intermediate to preparing lead picrate or DDNP.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:

Aspirin, 20 tablets (5 grain/tablet)
Alcohol - 95 percent pure
Concentrated sulfuric acid (boil battery acid until white fumes appear)
Potassium nitrate (Saltpeter)
Water
Canning jar (1 pint)
Hot water bath
Paper towels (for filter)
Glass tube or rod
Glass containers
Dish (ceramic or glass)
Heat source
Cup
Teaspoon

PROCEDURE:

1.  Crush 20 tablets of Aspirin in a glass container and
    work into a paste with a teaspoon of water.
2.  Add approximately 1/3-1/2 cup (100 milliliters) of
    alcohol with stirring and filter through a paper towel
    into another glass container.

    NOTE: If aspirin is pure enough (usually cheap priced
    aspirin are) then steps 1, 2 and 3 can be omitted and
    you can proceed and add crushed aspirin to sulfuric acid.

3.  Discard the solid left on the paper and pour the liquid
    from the container into the dish. Evaporate the alcohol
    and water on a hot water bath, leaving a white powder.
4.  Add this white powder to 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of
    concentrated sulfuric acid in a canning jar.
5.  Heat the jar in a simmering hot water bath for 15
    minutes and remove. Stir; solution will gradually turn
    black.
6.  Add 3 level teaspoons (15 grams) of potassium nitrate
    in three portions with vigorous stirring. After heating
    put jar in cold H2O and add KNO3.
7.  Allow the yellow-orange solution to cool to room
    temperature with intermittent stirring. Solution is
    darker than yellow-orange.
8.  Pour the solution into 1.25 cups (300 milliliters) of
    water (cold if possible) and allow to cool. Upon
    pouring, solution is now yellow-orange.
9.  Filter the mixture through a paper towel and wash the
    light yellow material (picric acid) with 1/8 cup (25
    milliliters) of water through paper towel. Takes
    considerable time to filter if genuine filter paper is
    used.
10. Dry at 160-200 degrees F for two hours. The yield is
    4.0-4.5 grams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 Tetramminecopper(II)Chlorate

Tetramminecopper(II)chlorate is a primary explosive that can be made from
sodium chlorate, copper sulfate and ammonia. This explosive when used with
a booster is capable of detonating composition C-4.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:

Sodium chlorate (Obtain as medicine, weed killer, defoliant,
		 or by field method)
Copper sulfate (Obtain as insecticide, water purifying agent,
		or by field method)

   a wide mouth bottle, then add 10 teaspoons of alcohol.
2. Add 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of copper sulfate and stir the
   mixture just under the boiling point for 30 minutes
   (heat can be supplied by a pan of hot water). The mixture
   will change color. NOTE: Keep solution away from flame.
3. Keep volume of the solution constant by adding additional
   alcohol about every ten minutes. Remove solution and let
   cool. Filter through folded paper towels into another
   wide mouth bottle. Keep the liquid.
4. Add 1 cup (250 milliliters) of ammonia to the narrow
   mouth bottle. Placing tubing so that it extends about
   1.25 inches inside bottle, then seal tubing to bottle
   with wax (pitch, clay etc.).
5. Place tubing into solution from step (3) as indicated
   in the [ASCII] picture [below]. Heat bottle containing
   ammonia in a pan of hot water (not boiling) for about
   10 minutes.

6. Bubble ammonia gas through solution until the color of
   the solution changes from a light green to a dark blue
   (approximately 10 minutes) and continue bubbling for
   another ten minutes.

* CAUTION: At this point the solution is a primary
	   explosive. Keep away from flame.

7. Reduce the volume of the solution to about 1/3 of its
   original volume by evaporating in the air or in a
   stream of air.
8. Filter crystals through a folded paper towel and wash
   once with one teaspoon alcohol, dry overnight (16 hours).

* CAUTION: Explosive is shock and flame sensitive.
	   Store in a capped container.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 Potassium (or Sodium) Nitrite and Litharge (Lead Monoxide)

Either of the nitrites are needed to prepare DDNP and litharge is required
for the preparation of lead picrate.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:

Lead metal (small pieces or chips)
Potassium (or sodium) nitrate
Wood (methyl) alcohol
Iron pipe with closed end or cap (one end only)
Iron rod (screwdriver)
Paper towels
Glass jars, wide mouth (2 each)
Heat source (such as hot coals or blow torch)
Cup

PROCEDURE:

1. Mix 12 grams of lead and 4 grams of potassium (or sodium)
   nitrate. Place the mixture in the iron container (iron
   pipe) and heat in a hot bed of coals or by a blow torch
   for an hour or more.
2. Remove the container and allow to cool. Chip out the
   yellow solid with the screwdriver and add to 1/2 cup (120
   milliliters) of methyl alcohol in the jar. Orange-brown
   solid, cream color in alcohol.
3. Heat the mixture in a pan of hot water until it reacts.
   Solution turns darker upon heating.
4. Filter the mixture through a paper towel into the second
   jar.
5. The solid left on the paper is lead monoxide. Wash it
   through paper twice, using 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) hot
   water each time and air dry before using in explosive
   preparation (for example, lead picrate).
6. place the jar with the liquid in the hot water and heat
   until alcohol has evaporated. The remaining powder is
   the nitrite, snowy liquid; some white powder appears,
   but not much.

* NOTE: Sodium nitrite has a strong tendency to pick up
	water from the atmosphere and should be stored in a
	closed container.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5 Preparation of Copper Sulfate (Pentahydrate)

Copper sulfate is a required material for the preparation of TAC.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:

Copper wire or pieces
Sulfuric acid (battery)
Potassium nitrate or nitric acid (field grades)
Alcohol
Water
Two heat resistant glasses or jars, one pint
Paper towels
Metal pan (for hot water bath)
Wooden rod
Cup

PROCEDURE:

1. Place 10 grams of copper into one of the jars and add one
   cup (240 milliliters) of sulfuric (battery) acid. To this
   mixture add 12 grams of potassium nitrate, or 1.5
   teaspoons of nitric acid. NOTE: Nitric acid gives a
   product of greater purity.
2. Heat the mixture on a hot water bath (near boiling) until
   the bubbling has ceased (requires about two hours).

* CAUTION: This reaction evolves strong toxic fumes, and
	   therefore must be performed in an open, well
	   ventilated area.

3. Pour the hot blue liquid into a second vessel (keeping
   the unreacted copper in the first jar) and allow to cool
   at room temperature.
4. After the crystals have formed, carefully pour away the
   liquid and crush the crystals. Then add 1/2 cup (120
   milliliters) of alcohol to the powder and stir.
5. Pour the solution through the towel filter and wash the
   solid left on the paper three times, using 1/2 cup (120
   milliliters) portions of the alcohol each time.
6. Allow the product to air dry for two hours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6 Reclamation of RDX From C-4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Lead Azide

Preparation of Hydrazinium sulfate.

2 NH  + NaOCl + H SO  ---> N H	* H SO	+ NaCl + H O
    3		 2  4	    2 4    2  4 	  2

One-hundred-forty-one ml of Chlorox bleach (5.25 percent NaOCl) was added
to 200 ml of 20 percent ammonium hydroxide and 5 ml of 1 percent limewater
Ca(OH)2 in one liter Erlenmeyer flask. The mixture was rapidly heated to
boiling and maintained until the volume was reduced to about half, which
required about one-half hour. The solution was rapidly cooled and dilute
sulfuric acid was added until a pH of 7-8 has attained and the precipitate
that formed was separated by filtration. The cold filtrate was strongly
acidified with 40 percent sulfuric acid. The white precipitate was
filtered, washed with methanol and air dried. Melting point 254 degrees C
(lit. 254 degrees C).

Preparation of Isopropyl Nitrite

A mixture of 45 ml concentrated sulfuric acid, 30 ml water and 110 ml
isopropyl alcohol, previously cooled to 0 centigrades, was added to an ice
cold solution of 114 grams of sodium nitrite in 450 ml of H2O. Slow
addition required about two hours in order to maintain a temperature around
0 centigrades. The upper oily layer was separated and washed three times
with 30 ml portions of 5 gram 100 ml sodium bicarbonate solution and 22
grams NaCl 100 ml solution respectively.

Preparation of Sodium Azide

N H  * H O + NaOH + C H ONO  ---> NaN  + C H OH + 3H O
 2 4	2	     4 9   2	     3	  4 9	    2

Five grams of caustic soda (NaOH) was dissolved in 50 ml if ethyl alcohol
(3A), and the clear portion was decanted in a 100 ml distilling flask
containing 6 ml of hydrazine hydrate. After adding one ml of butyl nitrite
(or isopropyl nitrite) the mixture was heated on a steam bath to initiate
the reaction. Twelve ml more of the nitrite was slowly added in such a
manner that the mixture refluxed slowly. Addition required about one hour
and the mixture was heated an additional fifteen minutes. The reaction
flask was cooled and the solid product collected on a filter. The product
was washed with alcohol and air dried. Recrystallization from water yielded
white crystalline material.

Preparation of Lead Azide

The following solutions were prepared:

Solution A: 0.20 g of sodium azide
            0.006 g of sodium hydroxide
            7 ml water

Solution B: 0.96 g Pb(NO3)2
            0.04 g Dextrin
            9 ml water

Solution B was brought to a pH of 5 by adding dilute NaOH.

Solution B was brought to 60 centigrades and solution A was slowly added
with stirring. The mixture was allowed to stir till ambient temperature was
attained and the solid azide collected on a filter. After washing with
water and air drying the product weighed 0.4 grams. This product was found
capable of initiating RDX when incorporated in a No. 6 blasting cap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Nitrourea

Preparation of Urea Nitrate

Twenty-five ml of concentrated nitric acid was added dropwise to an ice
cold solution of 5.0 grams urea in 25 ml of water. The white precipitate
was collected in a Buchner funnel and washed with ice cold nitric acid.
After drying at 100 centigrades for one hour, yield was 9.2 grams.

Preparation of Nitrourea

Nine (9.0) grams of the above product, urea nitrate, was added portionwise
to 32 ml of ice cold (-3 centigrades) concentrated sulfuric acid at such a
rate that the temperature did not exceed 5 centigrades. Total time for
addition was approximately one-half hour, after which the mixture was
poured on 75 grams of ice. The white precipitate was filtered, washed with
ice cold water, just sufficient to cover it, and air dried. Material
obtained weighed 5.3 grams and melted with decomposition at 157-158 centi-
grades. (lit. 158-159 centigrades).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Mannitol Hexanitrate, Nitromannitol

Ten grams of mannitol was added portionwise to 50 ml of concentrated nitric
acid keeping the temperature at 0 centigrades. 100 ml concentrated sulfuric
acid was then added dropwise maintaining temperature around 0 centigrades.
The slurry was filtered, washed with water and a dilute Na2CO2 and water
again, until washings were neutral. Products were air dried and had a
melting point of 113-115 centigrades (lit. 112-113 centigrades).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 Lead Nitranilate

Preparation of Chloranil

A slurry of 5.0 grams of salicylic acid and 100 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric acid was heated to 80 centigrades and 5.0 grams of potassium
chlorate added in portions (with effervescence). An additional 400 ml of
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 5.0 grams potassium chlorate was added
and the mixture allowed to heat at 80-90 centigrades for four hours. After
filtering, washing with water, and air drying, the yellow crystals melted
at 190-200 centigrades (sealed tube). The yield was 5.45 grams.

Preparation of Sodium Nitranilate

A mixture of 5.0 grams of chloranil and 200 ml of ethyl alcohol were heated
to boiling and treated with a solution of 5.6 grams of sodium nitrite in
100 ml of ethyl alcohol. The mixture was heated with stirring for one-half
hour and allowed to cool. The orange-gold crystalline product was collected
on a filter, washed with ethyl alcohol and air dried. Yield was 1.85 grams.

Preparation of Lead Nitranilate

A solution of 1.0 grams of sodium nitranilate in 100 ml of boiling

     [ Transcriber's note: I dunno what. A word is missing
       in the text. I guess it is H2O or maybe C2H5OH. ]

was filtered and the filtrate treated with 2.9 grams of lead nitrate
in 10 ml of water. The mixture was stirred for one-half hour and the gold
platelets collected on a filter and [washed] with water. After drying at 80
centigrades for three hours, the product weighed 1.23 grams. The product
ignited with a loud report on flame contact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5 Chloratotrimercuriacetaldehyde

A stream of acetylene (from calcium carbide in water) was led into a
solution of 0.3 gram of mercuric nitrate and 0.1 gram sodium chlorate
in 20 ml of water. The solid suspension was initially white then turned
grey upon further treatment with acetylene. The product was collected on a
filter, washed with water and air dried. Ignition temperature was ca. 150
centigrades as determined with a Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus.
                                                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.6 Trishydrazinezinc(II)Nitrate

To a solution of 5.0 grams of zinc nitrate in 25 ml of ethyl alcohol was
added a solution of 1.7 ml of 95 percent hydrazine in 5 ml of alcohol. The
precipitate that immediately formed was collected on a filter an washed
with ethyl alcohol. After drying for 2.5 hours at 90 centigrades the
product weighed 4.45 grams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7 Fulminating Silver

Silver chloride (from silver nitrate and hydrochloric acid) was treated
with sufficient ammonium hydroxide to effect solution. This solution was
treated with potassium hydroxide pellets until effervescence subsided. The
black mixture was diluted with water and the dark solid collected on a
filter. Attempts to remove te product from the wet filter resulted in an
explosion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8 Diamminesilver(II)Chlorate

A near saturated solution of silver chlorate (from silver nitrate and
sodium chlorate) in water was treated dropwise with concentrated ammonium
hydroxide. The dark product mildly deflagrated after isolation by
filtration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9 Triacetonetriperoxide

A mixture of 5 ml of acetone and 10 ml of 6 percent hydrogen peroxide was
cooled to 5 centigrades and treated dropwise with 3 ml of concentrated
sulfuric acid. The white precipitate that formed was extracted with ether,
and the extract was washed three times with cold water. The ether was
evaporated by a stream of air ant the product melted at 90-95 centigrades
(lit. 94-95 centigrades).

[ Transcriber's notes: This book contains a sometimes bad English, which I
  had not time to correct. I just wanted to tell you folks that it is the
  author, not me, that is the grammatical error-producer. The book also
  refers in every field description to an "improvised scale" that would be
  made in a chapter that doesn't exist in the book(!). I just omitted it
  from the descriptions, to not confuse you readers. ]
