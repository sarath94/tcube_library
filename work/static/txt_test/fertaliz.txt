                              FERTALIZER BOMB

INGREDIENTS:

Ammonium Nitrate: A bag of fertalizer would be sufficient...
A long fuse or a delayed ignitor
A Dynamite cap or 1/3 or a Dynamite or some M60's (Note: Any kind of explosive is OK).

METHOD:

Use about 2-3 pounds of fertalizer for the first time...Put it in a box or
a small bag and insert the dynamite or any other explosive into the
fertalizer. Run the long fuse or the delayed ignitor from the fertalizer
and run!!

WARNING: THIS IS A VERY REACTIVE MIXTURE AND REACTS INSTANTLY! MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO RUN AWAY OR THE FUSE IS LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO GET
AWAY...THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF BOMB THOSE BOZOS USED IN OKLAHOMA CITY
BOMBING...HOWEVER, THEY USED A FULL TRUCK OF FERTALIZER. BE WARNED! THIS
CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS TO SAY THE LEAST.
