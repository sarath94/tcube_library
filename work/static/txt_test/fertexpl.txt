
  FERTILIZER EXPLOSIVE BY MR. BYTE-ZAP

AN EXPLOSIVE MUNITION CAN BE MADE FROM
FERTILIZER GRADE AMMONIUM NITRATE AND
EITHER FUEL OIL OR A MIXTURE OF EQUAL
PARTS OF MOTOR OIL AND GASOLINE. WHEN
PROPERLY PREPARED, THIS EXPLOSIVE
MUNITION CAN BE DETONATED WITH A
BLASTING CAP.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:
-----------------
AMMONIUM NITRATE (NOT LESS THAN 32%
NITROGEN)

FUEL OIL OR GASOLINE AND MOTOR OIL
(1:1 RATIO)

TWO FLAT BOARDS. (AT LEAST ONE OF
THESE SHOULD BE COMFORTABLY HELD IN
THE HAND, I.E. 2 X 4 AND 36 X 36.)

BUCKET OR OTHER CONTAINER FOR MIXING
INGREDIENTS

IRON OR STEEL PIPE OR BOTTLE, TIN CAN
OR HEAVY-WALLED CARDBOARD TUBE

BLASTING CAP

WOODEN ROD - 1/4 IN. DIAMETER

SPOON OR SIMILAR MEASURING CONTAINER

PROCEDURE:
---------
1) SPREAD A HANDFUL OF THE AMMONIUM
NITRATE ON THE LARGE FLAT BOARD AND
RUB VIGOROUSLY WITH THE OTHER BOARD
UNTIL THE LARGE PARTICLES ARE CRUSHED
INTO A VERY FINE POWDER THAT LOOKS
LIKE FLOUR (APPROX. 10 MIN)

NOTE: PROCEED WITH STEP 2 AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE SINCE THE POWDER MAY TAKE
MOISTURE FROM THE AIR AND BECOME
SPOILED.

2) MIX ONE MEASURE (CUP, TABLESPOON,
ETC.) OF FUEL OIL WITH 16 MEASURES
OF THE FINELY GROUND AMMONIUM NITRATE
IN A DRY BUCKET OR OTHER SUITABLE
CONTAINER AND STIR WITH THE WOODEN
ROD. IF FUEL OIL IS NOT AVAILABLE,
USE ONE HALF MEASURE OF GASOLINE AND
ONE HALF MEASURE OF MOTOR OIL. STORE
IN A WATERPROOF CONTAINER UNTIL READY
TO USE.

3) SPOON THIS MIXTURE INTO AN IRON OR
STEEL PIPE WHICH HAS AN END CAP
THREADED ON ONE END. IF PIPE IS NOT
AVAILABLE, YOU MAY USE A DRY TIN CAN,
A GLASS JAR OR A HEAVY-WALLED CARDBOARD
TUBE.

NOTE: TAKE CARE NOT TO TAMP OR SHAKE
THE MIXTURE IN THE PIPE. IF MIXTURE
BECOMES TIGHTLY PACKED, ONE CAP WILL
NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO INITIATE THE
EXPLOSIVE.

4) INSERT BLASTING CAP JUST BENEATH
THE SURFACE OF THE EXPLOSIVE MIX.

NOTE: CONFINING THE OPEN END OF THE
CONTAINER WILL ADD TO THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF THE EXPLOSIVE.
