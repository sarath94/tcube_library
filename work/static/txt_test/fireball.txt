This file has no introduction.  We are going straight to the good stuff:

[:-----:]

     First of all, an easy to make homemade fireball.  All you need is a metal
  garbage can, a spray can of starting fluid (you can substitute WD-40, or
  some other kind of spray can that has "Extremely Flammable" printed on the
  side, but no gurantees.
  I've only tried starting fluid) and some matches.  Spray half the of
  starting fluid into the garbage can.  Done.

     Now, to light it, strike a match and in the same forward motion let go of
the match so the lighted match falls into the garbage can.  Don't stand TOO
close, because even though this is weak, it can still singe your hair off your
head.  Also, this way of striking matches is kind of fun to make games out of.  Put a rag
soaked in kerosene or something down below and go up on your roof with a
friend. The person to light the rag is the winner.  Make bets.

     You can't do this game with the garbage can, however. What makes the
flameball is not the liquid starting fluid on the sides, it's the fumes
escaping from the saturated garbage can.  Don't try to do this project on a
windy day, cause it will just blow all the fumes out of the can and you can't
light it.

[:-----:]

     Flameball for after christmas: Soak a christmas tree in 3 to 5 gallons of
gasolene (make sure you spread the gas all around) and light it using the same
match-throwing technique described above.  Make sure there's nothing above you
because my dad (yeah, he did this!  He didn't mean to pour so much gas on, 
though it singed the insulation off of some telephone wires overhead).
Light it quick, cause this also works mainly on fumes.

[:-----:]

     Carbide Bomb: This is really easy to make.  Get some calcium carbide
(obtainable at almost any hardware store). This stuff looks like gravel and is
used in carbide lamps.

     Anyway, put a few peices of the carbide in a glass jug with a layer of
 water covering the bottom.  Cap the bottle tightly and get pretty far away or
 behind cover.  The carbide will react with the water and create a flammable
 gas.  If you leave a burning rag nearby, you will get a good fireball. 
 However, you also will get a broken jug and flying peices of glass.  Watch the
 bomb through a sheet of clear plastic or swimming goggles or something.
 Believe me, a piece of glass in the eye hurts like a bitch!

[:-----:]

     Now, for the best one.  Get some kind of plastic bag, the bigger, the
more powerful.  You are going to fill this bag with acetylene.  Acetylene is a
very flammable gas, and it reacts with oxygen, so keep it away from normal air
or it will blow up.  It is used in acetylene torches, so you can probably find
a good supply of the stuff down at your local hardware store.

     So, to get around acetylene's quirks, fill up your garbage bag with
water, then fill up the garbage bag with the gas.  Usually, I use acetylene
straight from the torch. Refills aren't easy.  Anyway, twist the opening tight
and use a twistie to shut it completely.  Make absolutely sure there are no
leaks.  None!  Or it will blow up in your face.

     Leave the balloon in your garage until it is completely dry.  Now that
 it's dry, very carefully open up the top a bit and drop a few rocks in.  This
 is so it will pick up speed on the way down.  Now, drop in some impact
 explosives. Fun Snaps are okay, but I like making my own because they are
 easier and work better.  There are two recipes for these sort of explosives
 you can use.

     Recipe 1: Mix vaseline and potassium chlorate in a one-to-one ratio.
This will make a very wet sort of muddy mixture.  I could put out a fire with
it wet, but I could easily start one with it dry.  Just dry it in the sun on
some grass.  Never dry it on a street or other cement thing or roof: it might
blow up just because of the heat.

     Recipe 2: Mix 3 grams of potassium iodine with 5 grams of iodine in a
beaker with 50 ml of water in it.  Now add 20 ml of ammonium hydroxide.  Like
the stuff above, when dry, it becomes very exlosive, but is quite safe when
wet.

     Now drop some of your explosive in.  Tie the end up as tight as possible.
You now have a very powerful, shock sensitive, dangerous balloon.  Go out
immediately and use it.  Don't transport one of these in a car or something.
Drop the explosive in about a minute before you drop it.

     Be careful when launching this balloon, because the wind might blow it
right back towards you, and that wouldn't be good.  Also, you need to throw it
down a ways.  It needs to go far enough down so the fireball won't burn you
when it blows up.

     That ought to keep you guys at bay until we can get another installment
out.  Think anarchy!
