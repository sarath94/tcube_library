Materials Required:
==================

              Sulphuric Acid (Battery Acid)
              Gasoline
              Potassium Chlorate (Drug Store)
              Sugar
              Glass bottle w/stopper (roughly 1 quart size)
              Small bottle or jar w/lid
              Rag or absorbent paper (newspaper, paper towels, etc.)
              String or rubber bands

Procedure:
=========

1)  Sulphuric Acid Must be Concentrated. If battery acid or other dilute acid
    is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are given off.
    Container used should be of eenamelware or oven glass.

CAUTION:  Sulphuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is
          spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also
          dangerous and should not be inhaled.

2)  Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temerature.

3)  Pour gasoline into the large (1 quart) bottle until it is approximately
    2/3 full.

4)  Add concentrated sulphuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle is
    filled to within 1' to 2' from top.  Place the stopper on the bottle.

5)  Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION:  If this is not done, the fire bottle may be dangerous to handle
          during use.

6)  Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside
    of the bottle.  Tie with string or fasten with rubber bands.

7)  Dissolve 1/2 cup (100 gm) of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup (100 gm) of
    sugar in one cup (250 cc) of boiling water.

8)  Allow the solution to cool, pour into the small bottle and cap tightly.
    The cooled solution should be approx. 2/3 crystals and 1/3 liquid.  If
    there is more liquid than this, pour off excess before using.

CAUTION:  Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.

How To Use:
==========

1)  Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
    around the large bottle.  Bottle can be used wet or after solution has
    dried.  However, when dry, the sugar - Potassium chlorate mixture is very
    sensitive to spark or flame and should be handled accordingly.

2)  Throw or launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard surface
    (target) the fuel will ignite.

Conclusion:
==========

    This weapon proves to be very useful in torching Assholes and/or their
    possessions.  Use your imagination.
