OK, SO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN FIREWORKS?  NOTE: ALL THE AMOUNTS
GIVEN IN THESE DIRECTIONS ARE IN PARTS BY WEIGHT.  DO NOT USE PARTS BY VOLUME
(LIKE TEASPOONS OR SOMETHING), OR ELSE YOU COULD HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. 
ALWAYS MIX THESE CHEMICALS BY SHAKING THEM ON A SHEET OF PAPER OR SOMETHING. 
IF YOU GRIND THEM, STIR THEM, ETC. THEY COULD EXPLODE IN YOUR FACE!(AFTER
ALL, I DON'T WANT YOU TO KILL YOURSELF WHILE DOING THIS!)

FUSE:      1. DISSOLVE AS MUCH POTASSIUM NITRATE AS YOU CAN IN ABOUT A PINT OF
WATER AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.
           2. SOAK 5-6 INCH PIECES OF STRING OR PAPER IN THIS SOLUTION AND LET
THEM DRY.
           3. LIGHT THE FIREWORKS WITH THE STRING OR A PIECE OF PAPER ROLLED
INTO A TIGHT TUBE.

FLASH POWDER:      1. MIX:  1 PARTS POWDERED MAGNESIUM METAL & 4 PARTS
POWDERED POTASIUM NITRATE.
                   2. IGNITE WITH A VERY LONG FUSE.  THIS STUFF EXPLODES WITH
A HUGE WHITE FLASH, AND MAY BE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SCREW UP YOUR EYES IF YOU
LOOK STRAIGHT AT IT.

"SNAKES":      1. MIX:  5 PARTS POTASSIUM NITRATE
                       10 PARTS POTASSIUM DICHROMATE
                        5 PARTS REGULAR SUGAR
               2. MIX THESE POWDERS WITH ENOUGH MUSCILAGE OF ACACIA (THAT
GOOEY BROWN GLUE YOU CAN GET AT A DRUGSTORE) SO THAT YOU CAN MOLD THEM INTO
CONES ABOUT 1/2 AN INCH HIGH.
               3. WHEN DRY, LIGHT THE TIPS OF THE CONES WITH A MATCH.

FOUNTAIN #1:      1. MIX:  1 PART POWDERED MAGNESIUM METAL
                           1 PART POWDERED IRON METAL
                           1 PART POWDERED ZINC METAL
                           1 PART ANTIMONY SULFIDE
                           1 PART POWDERED CHARCOAL
                           1 PART POWDERED SULFUR
                           1 PART LYCOPODIUM POWDER
                           1 PART POWDERED SUGAR
                           1 PART POTASSIUM NITRATE
                  2. COAT A CARDBOARD TUBE AND PLUG THE BOTTOM WITH PLASTER OF
PARIS (THIS IS SO IT WON'T BURN).
                  3. FILL THE TUBE WITH THE MIXTURE, INSERT A FUSE, AND LIGHT
IT.
