    BASIC FIREWORKS BY FORD PREFECT

BECAUSE IT IS SOON GOING BE THE 4TH
I THOUGHT I WOULD SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR OWN FIREWORKS. ALL ARE EXPLOSIVE
BUT IN NORMAL QUANTITIES, AND IF THE
DIRECTIONS ARE FOLLOWED CAREFULLY,
THERE IS LITTLE DANGER OF BLOWING
YOURSELF UP.

FIRST IS A LIST OF CHEMICALS WHICH
ARE COMMONLY USED. THESE MIXTURES BURN
WITH DIFFERENT COLORS AND CAN BE USED
FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

THE NUMBERS FOLLOWING ARE PARTS BY
WEI OF EACH OF THE CHEMICALS. PARTS
BY WEIGHT IS A RATIO. 6 PBW MEANS FOR
EVERY 1 (GRAM FOR INSTANCE) YOU NEED 6
(GRAMS) OF THE OTHER.

WHITE:
POTASSIUM NITRA@e^......6
ANTIMONY SULFIDE........1
POWDERED SULFUR.........1

WHITE:
POTASSIUM NITRATE......24
POWDERED SULFUR.........7
CHARCOAL................1

POWDERED ROSIN..........1


CHEMICALS & SAFETY:

POTASSIUM NITRATE IS SOLD COMMERCIALLY
AS SALTPETER AND CAN BE FOUND IN ANY
DRUGSTORE. (IT IS USED AS A DIURETIC
FOR ANIMALS) POWDERED SULFUR IS ALSO
SOLD IN A DRUG STORE AND IS USED TO
REPEL TICKS.
CHARCOAL IS NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR
CHARCOAL BRICKETS POWDERED. SObdUM
CHLORIDE, OH COME ON!, TABLE SALT.
SODIUM CARBONATE IS ALSO CALLED SODA,
SODA ASH, SAL SODA, WASHING SODA, OR
GLASSMAKER'S SODA AND IS USED AS A
WATER SOFTENER.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR NOW BUT UNTIL
LATER MORE TO COME!!!!
