Here's the second installment of our file.  Flame throwers. These are one of my favorite things to p with.  They are good for detonating certain other 6-foot pyromaniac techniques (smoke bombs), andae't very destructive. These are kind of primitive, but they are pretty neat.

I know of no law outlawing flame throwers, but a cop will probably stop you if you are walking down  street shooting it into the air.  Later on, we will tell you how to make a good hand-held flame trwr out of WD-40 (or better).

Here's sort of a preview of the flame thrower coming later. I figure almost everyone knows about thibut for those 2% of you who don't, here you go.

[:-----:]

Get a can of WD-40, starter fluid, flammable paint, or any other spray can with "Extremably Flammablon the side. Hold a lit match or lighter about a foot away from the nozzle of the can, and spray. Yucan take your hand away, and it will stay lit.  Also, notice how the flame creeps towards the ca. Tr letting the flame get inside the can, but when it get hot, throw it as far from you as possibe.

[:-----:]

This doesn't shoot too much flame, but it shoots lot of smoke and heat.  It's super hot, so you coulo around making permanent graffiti on walls and telephone poles. Since this is permanent, the copsaegoing to get pissed and relentless if they catch you.  But, of course, they won't catch you.  Unes yu are being really stupid.  If you are being really stupid, you don't deserve this file anyway sodelte it immediately.

Anyway, this is pretty dangerous, if you don't follow the instructions carefully.  First, find some d model rocket engines.  I reccomend the "D" size, but you might not need that much power.  Now, g on to a hardware or plumbing
store and get a metal pipe so the engine fits inside it well.  The length doesn't matter because youe going to saw it down to size, but the width needs to be almost perfect.  Make sure the pipe isn' iht, because burned engines are a bitch to get out fast.

Now, get an end cap.  Put some Thread-Tite or something else so the end cannot unscrew for the worldI haven't ever had the end go flying off and the engine winging into the night, but you could be i ep shit if it does.

Now, get some rocket igniters from the same place you got the engines from.  Get one of those 9 voltttery caps that you plug your 9 volt battery into from an electronics store. Also, get a 9 volt wann lamp (hopefully some dark color like purple or blue.  Stay away from red, if possible, because edlihts (or clothes...  Check out our prowling file) attract unwanted attention.  So do bright blu, yllo, orange, white, and pink.

Solder some wire to the end of the 9-volt battery and solder that to a button.  Solder a short wire ing out of the button into the lamp.  Solder a short wire out of the lamp into nothing.  Solder a ogr length of wire to the other wire on the 9-volt battery into nothing.  Duct tape some styrofoamcofe-cup over the tube as insulation for your hand and the electronic equipment.  Make sure it doen'tcom off, cause if it does come off, the rest does too.  I would test this out before taping it he rst o the way so you don't have to unwrap it and fix it, and wrap it again. Now wrap the whole lectrnic ting to the pipe using electrician's tape, leaving the button and lamp exposed.

I would suggest getting a small box to put the 9-volt battery in, because when the battery runs out, is a pain in the butt to unwrap the whole thing, repelace the battery, and wrap it all back up.  ev the end of the box exposed from the tape except for a safety piece of tape, to ensure your battrywo't fall out.  You should also make the 9-volt clip on long wires, so it comes all the way out f te bx.  It is just too hard to clip a battery in when the battery is in a box.

If you would like to go high class, you might get a long tube to put extra engines in.  Make sure tot two end caps.  Put some Thread-Tite on one cap and screw it on. Now, screw the other cap off ando ntil it is really easy to unscrew and screw.  This might take a while, but persist. It's well wothitwhen you are out there on the nighttime street.

I duct taped this tube behind my other tube (with some styrofoam insulation in between, of course) s had a one and a half self contained permanent spray can.  Make sure you didn't tape the end cap yucn screw off up, or you are going to have to take it apart and tape it all over again. Make sure outae it TIGHT and used a ton of tape.  There should be no way in hell the tubes are going to fallapat.  also taped a box to this tube to put my rocket igniters in.  They tend to break really easiy.

To finish up, clip some alligator clips onto the wires coming out of the electrician's tape.  Now wrthe whole damn thing in electrician's tape, or some other kind of black tape, so it can be used atngt.  You are done.

Now, when you go prowling and come to a wall or something you would like to mark, put your pipe strat up and down. Get an engine out of your engine tube, and put it in the short pipe with the end wihte hole sticking out.  Get an igniter out of your box and connect the two wires sticking out to te llgator clips (making sure the lamp isn't lit. If it is, the igniter is going to get VERY hot). Now pu the igniter into the little hole in the engine.  Now, hold the pipe at a 45 degree angle an poit itaway from everyone.  Now, push the button.  After a second, if the engine doesn't light, ten wat abot 3 seconds so you are sure the engine won't light when you are in front of it, put in aother ocket gniter and try the button again.

If, however, the engine does light, you've got it made. Write whatever you want, and get out of ther You will notice the force of the engine will keep it in the pipe, even if you aim the pipe straigtdwn.  Did you know these
engines work under water?  Figure something to do with that...

[:-----:]

If you have a car with a tailpipe that shoots exhaust straight out the back, this one's for you!  Onuse it when you want to seriously hurt something behind you.  I assume you know how a spark plug adsitch work, because you own a car.

Drill a hole 4 or 5 inches up the tailpipe of your car.  Put the spark plug in the hole (with the sp part aiming into the pipe) so it won't fall out.   Run some ignition wire from one terminal of yorbttery to your spark plug.

Mount a switch on your dash or in your glove compartment. Put one of those clear plastic flip-up cov over it, so it won't accidentally get pressed.  I've seen some of these flames go 20 feet!

Label the switch "Flame Thrower" so nobody will say, "Hey! What does this do?"  Nobody will really bive you, so all the better.  We don't want any trouble with the "good officers of the law."

Connect a length of wire between the switch and your battery, and a length of wire between the switcnd the spark plug.  You now have a functional flame thrower.  Be very careful when using this, becueyou could accidentally light the neighbors shrubs on fire.

Now that it's working, you can add some frills.  I added a light and a second (Flame Thrower Armed &ady) switch to my dash so it's even harder to accidentally turn on and it tells when the flame is on.  I would get toasted by the highway patrol if I was going down the highway and didn't even kno Iwa frying the car behind me.
