In order to make this type of flamethrower, you will need the following:

           1: An aresol can (bugspray, or any flamable spray can)
           2: An alcohol lamp (or candle)
           3: A lighter (or book of matches)
           4: Strong tape
           5: Super glue (or any type of strong glue)
           6: Strong gloves (optional, but required)
           7: Sheet metal (or tin foil(optional))
           8: Alcohol (or some type of lighting fluid)

   To start it off, take the full aresol can and the alcohol lamp, and
glue the lamp to the can. Hold the lamp for a while till it dries. Then,
when it's dry, take the tape and wrap it around the lamp and the can so 
that the can and the lamp are strongly fastened to each other.
   After that, take the sheet metal (if you have it) and cut a piece
about 1" by 1" and bend the metal so that it can be wrapped around the
can in front of where the nozel is. after it is shaped, punch or drill
a hole in the piece of metalbig enough for spray to be released through
it. Then, take the metal and put glue where the metal will be fastened to
the can. Glue the piece of metal to the cann and hold it till it dries.
Then, you can tape it down so it stays put.
   After that's done, fill the alcohol lamp with alcohol and wet the wick
at the very tip that sticks out of the lamp. 
   Next, take the gloves you might have, and put those on. Light the wick
of the lamp, being sure that no wind is gonna purn thos gloves right off
your hands. Before you start to spray, keep it a long distance away from
your face. Then, go and spray and watch the thing your burning melt down
to a crisp. Try using it as a black spraypaint can and use it to grafitti
on walls and houses. If you want to put the lamp out, use a candle snuffer
or blow it out with all your might.
