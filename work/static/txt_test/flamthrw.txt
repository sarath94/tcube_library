HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN PERSONAL PHLAMETHROWING DEVICE

              BY: PROWLER

YOU'LL NEED:

. A SMALL GARDEN SPRAYER (MUST BE METAL)

. A BACKPACK OF REASONABLE SIZE.

. A LENGTH OF TUBING (STIFF PLASTIC) ABOUT THE SAME DIAMETER AS THE TUBING ON
   THE SPRAYER (2-3' LONG).

. A CIRCLE FO METAL ROUGHLY THE SAME DIAMETER AS A GRAPEFRUIT.

. A SOLDERING IRON.
. SOME SOLDER, BLACK TAPE, AND SEALANT.

. SOME SMALL HANDLES, AND INSULATION.

 NOW, HERE'S HOW TO MAKE THE SUCKER:

     TAKE THE TUBING OFF OF THE GARDEN SPRAYER (MAINLY CAUSE THE FUEL WILL EAT
THROUGH IT, AND YOU WILL BE A CRISPY CRITTER).

     REPLACE IT WITH THE HARD PLASTIC TUBING (3).

     SOLDER THE CIRCLE OF METAL ON JUST BELOW THE NOZZLE SO THAT YOU CANNOT GET
CAUGHT BY THE SPRAY.

     SOLDER THE HANDLES ONTO THE METAL PART OF THE SPRAYER TUBE, AND SPRAY THEM
WITH THE INSULATION, THEN WRAP THEM IN BLACK TAPE.

     PUT THE TANK IN THE BACKPACK, AND ZIP IT UP SO IT'S TIGHT, THEN HOOK THE
ZIPPERS TOGETHER WITH SOME WIRE.

     YOU NOW HAVE A SMALL RELIABLE PHLAME THROWER.

 PHLAMETHROWER DOX:
. NEVER LET YOUR TANK RUN TOO LOW.

. ONLY USE THE FUEL LISTED BELOW.

. DO NOT ALLOW THE TANK TO BECOME PUNCTURED, OR DENTED.

. NEVER USE AN OPEN PHLAME TO LIGHT THE PHLAMETHROWER.

   STICK BY THIS, AND YOU SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

 PHLAMETHROWER FUEL:

  THE BEST FUEL I HAVE FOUND IS:

  1 PART COLEMAN'S LANTERN FUEL.
  2 PARTS KEROSENE
  1 PART GAS
---------------------------------------
NEVER USE STRAIGHT GAS ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!
---------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:

 PROWLER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU ARE MAIMED, ROASTED, OR OTHERWISE HURT WITH
A HOMEMADE PHLAMETHROWER. I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MIGHT
INCUR WITH IT. NOW GO TURN SOME LOCAL BUREAUCRAT INTO A CRISPY CRITTER!
