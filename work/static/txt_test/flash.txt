Here it is, the first installment of a long (hopefully more than 10 files)
series of files telling how to blow up and burn things.  They are meant for
fun, but can be used to make your point.  Nothing better to make your point
than just blowing the f
uck out of something.

I know 6 feet under isn't a very good name, but it was the only one we could
think of that was decent that we thought up.  But hey, it's not the name of
the file ... Its the contents, right?

Later on, we will make files telling how to make M-80s, M-100s, CO2 bombs, and
a bunch of other stuff.  For now, because this file is already too long, we'll
just tell you how to make the flash powder, and you figure out what do do with
it.  Well, he
re you go...
____________________________________________________________

Flash powder is powder that burns so fast that it looks like it just flashes
out of existence.  However, if approximately 4 ounces of the stuff explodes
together, you will notice that the flash is accompanied by quite an explosion.
Also, when mixed
perfectly, 4 ounces of this stuff can explode with the force of up to one
stick of dynamite.  Now, that's powerful!

All of the powders should be ground up into a very fine powder, about 400 mesh
or better.  Common household flour is about 400 mesh.  You can sometimes buy
powdered aluminum or other chemicals at 600 mesh.  This stuff is awesome for
flash powder!

The mixture of any chlorate with phosphorus or sulfur is extremely sensitive
 to friction and percussion and explodes with great violence.  Chlorate
 explosives must not be stored together with ammonium nitrate explosives,
 since ammonium chlorate which
 is formed when these two substances touch explodes, taking both mixtures of
 flash powder with it.

When mixing chlorate explosives, crush all of the chemicals separately.  Sift
the oxidizer through a piece of screen
wire to break up the material into small pieces.  Then sif the other chemicals
if they need it.   Mix all the chemicas together and finish up by sifting them
through a piece of fine wire screen or shaking them in a Zip-Loc bag.  Do not
use this kind
of mixing when the mixture is sensitive to friction, impact, or static
electricity.

                        Formula one:

           - 2 ounces of Potassium Perchlorate
           - 1 ounce of 600 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula is one of the best.  It produces a very, very, extremely lound
explosion.  Easy to ignite with a fuse, it is not moisture absorbent, not very
sensitive to impact or friction.  Sodium chlorate or Potassium chlorate can be
used instead of
potassium perchlorate but it becomes very sensitive to friction and impact.
Four ounces of this stuff equals one stick of dynamite.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula two:

           - 2 ounces of Potassium Perchlorate
           - 1 ounce of 400 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula is almost as good as formula one.  This is what most
firecrackers, M-80s and other fireworks are made of.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula three:

           - 3 ounces of Barium Nitrate
           - 3 ounces of Potassium Perchlorate
           - 4 ounces of 400 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula produces a very bright flash.  It used to be used for the flash
boxes for olden day box cameras you see in the old movies.  That T-stick the
photographer holds up is filled with this stuff.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula four:

           - 2 ounces of Potassium Perchlorate
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur
           - 1 ounce of 400 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula is not very impact or friction sensitive.  It produces a very,
very loud explosion.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula five:

           - 2 ounces of Sodium Chlorate
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur
           - 1 ounce of 400 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula is very moisture absorbent but it is very imact and friction
sensitive.  Not so much flash as noise is put out by it.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula six:

           - 2 ounces of Potassium Chlorate
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur
           - 1 ounce of 400 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula is used in the manufacture of cap gun caps, so naturally it is
very impact sensitive.  Watch out, because it could blow up at any time when
making it.  Only make small amounts at a time, so if it blows up, it won't
take you with it.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula seven:

           - 6.7 ounces of Potassium Chlorate
           - 2.7 ounces of Red Phosphorus
           - 0.3 ounce of Sulfur
           - 0.3 ounce of Calcium Carbonate

This formula is very, very, extremely sensitive to impact, friction, and even
electricity.  It is amazingly dangerous!! It will ignite even when wet.  Stay
as far away from it as possible, especially when making it.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula eight:

           - 2 ounces of Potassium Permaganate
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur
           - 1 ounce of 400 mesh Aluminum Powder

This formula is slightly impact sensitive, so be careful when making it.  I
love it because it ignites automatically when it gets wet.  Dump some water on
it or leave it out when it's raining and kablooey!  This stuff has endless
uses.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula nine:

           - 7.5 ounces of Potassium Chlorate
           - 1.5 ounces of Charcoal Dust
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur

This formula produces a very small explosion when ignited in the open, but
when put in a strong container, can really blow things apart with lots of
noise.  It is impact and friction sensitive, so watch out.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula ten:

           - 6 ounces of Potassium Chlorate
           - 3 ounces of Animony sulfide
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur

Watch it, because this formula and the ones following have not been tested and
could be highly volatile.  Only make these if you are into pain.
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula eleven:

           - 7.5 ounces of Sodium Chlorate
           - 1.5 ounce of Charcoal Dust
           - 1 ounce of Sulfur
____________________________________________________________

                        Formula twelve:

           - 7.5 ounces of Potassium Chlorate
           - 2.2 ounces of Gallic Acid
           - 0.3 ounce of Red Gum

There you go.  We will tell you how to make M-80, etc. in later issues.  We
can't exhaust all our ideas immediately, ygu know.  And remember, a true
anarchist doesn't need detailed instructions.  However, they do come in handy.
Seeya...
