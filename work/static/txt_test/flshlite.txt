    HOW TO MAKE A FLASHLIGHT BOMB

A FLASHLIGHT BOMB IS FAIRLY EASY IT
MAKE AND CAN BE CONCEALED SO WELL, THAY
IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT
IT. HERES WHAT TO DO:
 
GET YOURSELF ONE FLASHLIGHT OF ANY
SIZE, SHAPE, OR CREED, AND THE 
BATTERY/BATTERIES THAT GO ALONG WITH
IT.  NOW IT IS TIME FOR AN IMPORTANT
DECISION.  DEPENDING UPON THE TYPE
OF BOMB YOU REQUIRE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A CHOICE IN MATERIALS.  HERE ARE YOUR
CHOICES:
 
[1] MERCURIC CHLORIDE - GAS BOMN
[2] PURE SODIUM+WATER - FLAME BOMB
[3] SULFURIC NITRATE  - ACID BOMB
[4] GUNPOWDER (TNT)   - BOOOOOOOOM!
 
NOW, TAKING THE MATERIAL FOR THE TYPE 
OF BOMB YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE, 
PROCEED TO PUT ROCKS, BB'S, GLASS
PELLETS, ETC... IN THE BOTTOM OF A
HOLLOWED OUT BATTERY/BATTERIES, UNLESS
YOU ARE MAKING A FLAME BOMB, WHICH IN
THAT CASE READ ON.  THEN LINE A 
MAGNESIUM STRIP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE
FLASHLIGHT APPRERING ON TOP OF THE
FLASHLIGHT SO YOU MAY LIGHT IT.  NEXT,
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF THE
EXPLOSIVE YOU CHOSE IN THE BATTERY. 
[ NOT YOU MAY LIGHTLY PACK IT IN, BUT
DO NOT HIT IT!!! MY FRIEND WAS PACKING
A HOME-MADE BOMB ONE DAY, AND HAMMERED
THE COVER ON, AND BLEW A HOLE RIGHT 
THROUGH HIS LIQUOR CABINET ] NEXT,
SECURE THE TOP, LEAVING ROOM TO INSERT
THE MAGNESIUM STRIP.  IT SHOULD LOOK
LIKE THIS:

     -----------
     \         /
      \       /
       \_____/
       ! BMB !
       ! BMB !
       ! BMB !
       ! BBB !
       !     !
       !_____!

IN THE LAST DIAGRAM, (B) STANDS FOR 
BATTERY AND (M) FOR MAGNESIUM.  ALSO
INSIDE THE BATTERY SHOULD BE THE AMMO
AND THE EXPLOSIVE.  
 
NOW FOR THE FLAME BOMB...THE SODIUM,
SHOULD BE ON THE TOP, AND THE WATER
IN A BABYFOOD JAR.  THE SODIUM USED
HERE IS NOT TABLE SALT!!!  YOU WON'T
NEED THE MAG. STRIP BEAUSE NUMBER 1,
BECUASE ALL YOU NEED DO IS HIT THE
FLASHLIGHT AGAINST SOMETHING HARD.
DO NOT HOLD IT---THROW IT AS FAR AS
YOU CAN!!!


           remember DONT GET CAUGHT!
