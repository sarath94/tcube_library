    Here we go!!  the good ole' Cap'n is here today boys and girls to let you know of his special formula for making FIREBOMBS!!  aren't you lucky!!

    Now the Cap'n doesn't tell this to anyone, BUT since you are all old enough now, and the Cap'n feels also mature and responsible enough not to use this information other than for self indulgence of knowledge and no other evil purposes.. he'll tell you!  Also if more people make FIREBOMBS just like the Cap'n, if the Cap'n ever gets caught then our wonderful loving Government (Now the super power of the world) will maybe not be able to make every fire supposedly started by the jolly ole' Cap'n stick in a court of law.  =)                
    Now to begin...  when you set a bomb certain things have to be kept in mind... the 2 most important parts are...

    1.  DON'T GET CAUGHT LIKE AN UNPROFFESIONAL ASSHOLE!
    2.  IF YOU SET A BOMB MAKE SURE IT WORKS!



**********************************************************************
                             SECTION #1
**********************************************************************

    If you don't want to get caught.... and I know you don't...there are mny many things you always have to consider, but the Cap'n doesn't have the time to sit his lazy ass in front of the computer and type that much so I will only give you the basics..

    If you decide to cause a structure fire or any sort of fire understand you are probably going to be chrged with a felony if you get caught.. you could get away with a big fine and/or pidly minimum security jail time if its only outside stuff like a field and some bushes, but be careful... if it spreads and gets a structure or gets so out of hand it destroys a ton of land you had better lay low for a while.
    Our country is great and when starting fires you can always bet you will bring the very best out of it.  Through use of our countries fine and unbiased media you can suddenly find your insignificant and beautiful fire siddenly turned into something ugly evil and well a felony..  so whatever you do.. don't burn something popular or that will bring big media attention..  Please think twice about setting fire to that orphanage or that Vietnam War memorial.. no matter how well you think it is going to serve your political purposes. Try that post office.. on second thought don't... here's why..
    
     You will get yourself into huge trouble by bombing anything that is owned by our illustrious government, this includes national monuments, national parks, national forests, the post office anything that the federal government may have a hand in.

    Probably the most important part is not getting caught.. as Cap'n Crunch! always says "...What the fuck are you worried about?...If we don't get caught we don't have to worry abot what happens if we do"

    Covering your tracks is very important.  Always try to hide a motive... don't ever be stupid and be put on the cops #1 hit lists because you had a reason to do it... Unless of course if you belong to some shitty terrorist group who is so low you come to the Cap'n for advice, then you might want to take credits for the deed...Also if you are hired by someone to do a job follow these 3 rules..

    1.  *Never deal with domestic problems!

    2.  If involved wiht Industrial Espionage deal ONLY with BIG BOYS!

    3.  Only work for those who won't flake, if you have any questions         about the clients.. don't do it... also get the money in               advance.. and in cash (more about that in a later file)
 
        * When I say DOMESTIC PROBLEMS I mean if some wacked out lady wants you to kill her ex-husband or something tell her you don't know what the hell she's talking about and walk away... don't get mixed up in this stuff... don't brag about what you do.. and don't even talk to that lady again.. because if you do thinking your going to get some pussy and thats it you're sadly mistaken... walk out of there before you get mixed up with something that will get you in jail... the Cap'n knows all too well about getting mixed up with amatures... the domestic jobs are a dime a dozen but your balls are on the line every time and you're one lucky son-of-a-bitch if you get away with it... stick with big jobs and get a nice portfolio that will attract more big jobs...Also when I talk about BIG BOYS I mean those companies that are so big this act will get lost in the shuffle... usualy corporations that are so huge that this will get lost in the shuffle are the best bets... ones that have a wide spread of buisnesses and are national known (beginners won't get these jobs usualy because they usualy don't hire out because they already have men for those jobs or have ties with the Mafia)..whichis a group you never want to get involved with.. your chances of doing freelance work is shot and you never want to owe favors to them or any groups like them...  Get involved with a corporation that may want you to slow or stop an up and coming smaller buisness that would cut into thier profits... that way even if the buisness gets fingered they will never have the capital to take it to court and still run a buisness... also if you are working for a BIG BOY  they may could even buy District Attorneys and prosecutors and shit like that off..

 Welll that should be it for who to bomb and who not to bomb, except for you budding terroist agencies and virgin anarchists I leave this last section to you..I'll give you information adn tips on where to bomb both with fire and explosives.  Not because I think you're special or anything.. because I'm too lazy to differentiate between the two.

    When selecting a target to bomb there are a few things you always must consider.

    1.  Is this target fulfilling your purpose?
    2.  Will the location cause the damage comotion wanted?
    3.  Could you find a better place?
    4.  Will the explosive be found prematurely?

    If you have answered all these questions satisfactory then I guess you have found the location... sometimes the location can vary a few feet even a few inches and make a big difference... If placed near some sort of power source trying to be knocked out one must put it in an exact location as opposed to a general one.. or as I found out embarassingly.. a car bomb was placed by an associate of mine under the hood of a car, naturaly.. and also placed to the left side (we knew he was to be the passenger).. he even set the fuse to a piece of the engine that would get hot and set it off (instead of the spark plugs) .. in case someone would want to warm up the car first.. but to our surprise a few minutes on the road the car exploded with the passenger (the target) and the driver in the car, the target walked out of it almost completly unhurt!!  They were not involved in an accident since they were pulling out of an intersection.  =(  boy were we embarassed!!  not as embarassed as we realized in our haste why this happened...  WE BOMBED A FUCKING LIMO..WITH THE BOMB IN FRONT!!
    Now the man knew someone was trying to kill him and we had to do the job all over the next week...when his NEWLY HIRED security guards wouldn't notice... what a pain in the ass.. needless to say the target later found some Chinese food that didn't agree with him..  =)

    When bombing a target here are some things to look for:

    1.  Water mains, power supplies, phone and gas lines ESPECIALLY make for great targets, causing more destruction and confusion long after the bomb.
    2.  Arches, keystones or any support that will cause a structure to crumple
    3.  Older structures that will fall apart or burn like a match (City Hall maybe?)   =)
    4.  Well used or traveled areas that will cause more people to take notice and maybe take some lives with you.( explosives must be hidden very well in this case)

    There you go Anarchists..  go and have fun and  "Happy Bombing"

   well that's it for PART 1... I'll finish telling you about the buisness of FIRE for money in PART 2 and the Cap'n will tell you how to make his famous FIREBOMBS and maybe if you're lucky some ways of settign them off.. who knows what I'll feel like...
