DISCLAIMER :

IF YOU GET CAUGHT YOU HAVE TO PAY THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT, NOT ME !!!!
 
Okay I gonna tell you a true story...You'll learn a lot of things from it...

A well-dressed man with one little boy enters in a VERY EXPENSIVE restaurant.
They sit down, look the menu and take the more expensive and delicious things,
from the antipasto to the dessert. When they have finished, the man asks the
waiter for the bill. When received, he has a quick look at it, he whispers
something to the child, then he says to the waiter : "Oooh I'm sorry but now I
can't pay the bill in cash. I'm going to take my Credit Card I left in my big
car....Meanwhile, could you watch over my son until i'll be back please ?".
He disappears. Half an hour. One hour. The waiter becomes impatient and says
to the young boy : "Hey boy, where did your father go ?"

ANSWER : I really don't know Sir, and he is NOT my father...He picked me up in
         the street and said "Come with me to the reastaurant; if you always
         call me dad, you can eat whatever you want !!!!"
