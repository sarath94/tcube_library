       -+ Part I +-
    Fast Burning Fuses

    The burning rate of this fuse is approximately 40 in. (100
    cm) per minute.

    Material Required:
    -----------------
                                  /
    Soft Cotton String           / Potassium Nitrate 25 parts
    Fine Black Powder ------ or <  Charcoal           3 parts
    Piece of Round Stick         \ Sulphur            2 parts
    Two Pans or Dishes            \

    Procedure:
    ---------

    1. Moisten fine Black Powder to form a paste or prepare a
    substitute as follows:

          A. Dissolve Potassium Nitrate in an equal amount of
          water.
          B. Pulverize charcoal by spreading thinly on a hard
          surface and rolling the round stick over it to crush to
          fine powder.
          C. Pulverise the sulphur in the sam manner.
          D. Dry mix sulphur an charcoal.
          E. Add Potassium Nitrate solution to dry mix to obtain
          a thoroughly wet paste.

    2. Twist of braid three strands of cotton string together.

    3. Rub paste mixture into twisted string with fingers and
    allow to dry.

    4. Check the actual burning rate of the fuse by measuring the
    time it takes for a known legth to burn. This is used to
    determine the lenght ned for the desired time.

       -+Part II+-
    Slow Burning Fuses

    The burning rate of the fuse is approximately 2 in. per
    minute.

    Material Required:
    -----------------
    Cotton String or 3 Shoelaces
    Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate
    Granulated Sugar

    Procedure:
    ---------
    1. Wash cotton string or shoe lace in hot soapy water; rinse
    in fresh water.

    2. Dissolve 1 part Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate
    and 1 part granulated in 2 parts hot water.

    3. Soak string or shoelace in solution.

    4. Twist or braid three strands of string and allow to dry.

    5. Measure the actual buring rate like said above.

    *-* NOTE *-*
    The last few inches of this cord (the end inserted in the
    material to be ignited) should be coated with the fast
    burning Black Powder Paste if possible. This MUST BE DONE
    when the fuse is used to ignite the blasting cap.
