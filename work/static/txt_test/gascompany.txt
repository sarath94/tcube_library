* BACKGROUND *
**************

	I got the Idea of writing this file when my science teacher 
told me a little some-thing about the gas company. Yes, thats right
my science teacher. I am 90% sure that this will work if you follow
my steps. Remember, messing with the gas company is a fedral offence, 
so dont get cought!

* USEFULL ITEMS *
*****************

	Ok, here is watcha need :
	
		Brains
		Wire Cutters
		Gloves(optional)
		Metal kit
		
   Well you dont really need much things for this. I would really help if you
work at a metal shop or have metals for school. Lets get on with the file.

****************
* Step by Step *
****************

   Ok heres what you do. First you gotta go outside and find your gas meter-
detector. You know what these look like. They the ones that look like little
watches on them. With a silver(whatever color it is) plate spinning around. Well
the gas company takes a look at those "watches" and writes how many times the
meter has gone around. Then they send you a bill! YUCK! Well, what makes these
"watches" go around? Well in side the box there is a small rubber tire. (Looks
like a tire), Anyways, the gas comes out through this one tube and pushes the
tire making it go around. The tire makes the watches go around and theres how
you get billed! *BUT* on each out-side box there is a little wire connected
to the box so you can not open the box. On the wire is a little tag on it.
Well if you can get into a metals shop and make a duplacit(sp) of this then
your set. Because if the gas man comes around and sees that there is no tag on
the box, your in deep shit! Well once you got it off the box, its all simple.
Just find that little rubber tire and turn is back a little, well go ahead and
turn it back as much as you want. Doing this, makes the watches go backwards
and lowering the price of your gas. Then next day go to the metals shop and 
try to make the tag look the same! Your tag might be different then mine is,
so do it however it needs to be done. Just as long as you got that tag on the
box, your pretty much safe.
