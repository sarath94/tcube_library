Formulas For Gelatin Dynamites
------------------------------

        As with most of the explosive substances in this chapter, there are
hundreds of different recipes. Each chemist claims he's got the most poweful
and safest recipe. What I have attempted to do is collect the most common
industrial and military formulas, since these function in the correct context
that this book is written.
