	3.)Enough gun powder to fill the bottle.
	4.)A lid for the bottle.
	5.)A nail.
	6.)Three strips of paper
	7.)small piece of tape

Directions:
	1.)Fill the bottle with gun powder
	2.)Make a hole in the cap of the bottle so that the nail fits in.
	3.)cut the nail so that the head is off and so that it's not sharp 
	4.)Put the primer on the opening of the bottle, then screw the cap back on
	5.)Put the nail in the cap an put some tape on it so it doesn't fall out.
	6.)tape the three strips of paper on the bottom of the glass so when 
	   you throw it the air, the top lands first.
	7.)Throw the GLASS GRENADE high in the air  and run, when it lands, 
	   it will hit the nail and ignite the primer, the primer will ignite 
	   the gun powder inside the bottle and it's going to explode!
