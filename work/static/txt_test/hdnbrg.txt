This "experiment" reminds us of the famous zepplin Hindenburg.  The Hindenburg
was filled with moderatly volatile (and highly expensive) hydrogen, this
version will use a commonly available (and very volatile!) oxygen-acetelyene
mixture...

  1) Obtain the use of an oxygen-acetelyene cutting torch (school metal or
auto shop, body shop, jeweler, or bike shop should have one handy).  Light the
torch and find the "perfect" mixture - very blue flame.  Have someone help if
needed.  REMEMBER THE SOOHE OXY/ACE KNOBS.
 
2) Let the torch cool - cold to the touch...
 
3) Open the valves to the SAME SETTING AS ABOVE.
 
4) Put a nice, thick, big balloon over the nozzle.  Don't skimp on your balloon
selection.  Get the biggest and sturdiest, it's only 98 cents.
 
5) Fill and tie the balloon.  Shut off the nozzles and find yourself a LONG
fuse,  (string dipped in glue then black powder does nicely) and simply tape
one end of the fuse to the side of the balloon.
 
6) Put the balloon in the nearest car or trash can.  Extend the fuse
HORIZONTALLY - FAR FROM THE BALLOON: MAKE SURE NO ASHES WILL FALL ON THE
BALLOON PREMATURLY.
 
7) The famous last words: light and run like hell...
