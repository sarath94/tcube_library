            Just in case you wan to hotwire a car.


THE EASIEST WAY IS TO GET UNDER THE DASHBOARD AND START CROSSING WIRES. OF
COURSE THAT COULD SHORT OUT THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SO HERE IS A BETTER
WAY.
WHEN YOU GET IN THE CAR LOOK UNDER THE DASH. IF IT'S ENCLOSED THEN DON'T
BOTHER. MOST NEW CARS ARE LIKE THIS UNFORTUNATELY. HOWEVER YOU COULD CUT
THROUGH THE DASH. IF YOU DO CUT IT DO IT NEAR THE IGNITION.
ONCE YOU GET BEHIND OR NEAR THE IGNITION, LOOK FOR TWO RED WIRES. IN OLDER
CARS THIS WAS THE STANDARD COLOR CODE. IF THEY AREN'T THERE YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
TRY WHATEVER ELSE YOU CAN FIND.
PULL OUT THE TWO RED WIRES AND CROSS THEM THE CAR SHOULD START.
