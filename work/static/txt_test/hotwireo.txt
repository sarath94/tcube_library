=====================


THE EASIEST WAY IS TO JUST GET UNDER
THE DASHBOARD AND START CROSSING WIRES.
OF COURSE THIS COULD SHORT OUT THE
ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SO THERE IS A
BETTER WAY.

WHEN YOU GET IN THE CAR, LOOK UNDER THE
DASH.  IF IT'S ENCLOSED THEN DON'T
BOTHER. MOST NEW CARS ARE LIKE THIS
UNFORTUNATELY. HOWEVER YOU COULD CUT
THROUGH THE DASH. IF YOU DO CUT JUST DO
IT NEAR THE IGNITION.

ONCE YOU GET BEHIND OR NEAR THE
IGNITION, LOOK FOR TWO RED WIRES.
IN OLDER CARS THIS WAS THE STANDARD
COLOR CODE.  IF THEY AREN'T THERE
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY WHATEVER ELSE
YOU CAN FIND.

PULL OUT THE TWO WIRES AND CROSS THEM.
THE CAR SHOULD START.
