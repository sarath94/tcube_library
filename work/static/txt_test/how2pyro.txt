 (> SUPLIES <)

  1. Lighter, matches (What pyro's a pyro without firo?)
  2. Combustubale liquid (Gas, Airplane dope, Coleman fuel, etc..)
  3. Couple mayo jars
  4. Rags
  5. Model rocket engines (Hobby store, Duh..)
  6. Fuses (anykind)
  7. Enemy (Not hard to find), or open space, away from houses (wonder why?) 
  8. Aresole can (Raid, WD-40 is effective!)
 
.............................................     
 (> FIRE BOMB <)

 1. Take a mayo jar, fill er' up with your combustubale liquid. If you 
don't have enough combust. then use a smaller jar.
 2. Soak Rag in combust. and then place one end inside the jar, and one out. 
Now screw the lid onto the jar so that it keeps the rag held firmly to the
jar.
 3. Shake jar to find any leaks. Seal all of them somehow! (Puddy works)
This is important from keeping you from becoming a crispy critter!
 4. You now have a "Molytive Cattail", homemade style. To operate, simply
light rag on fire (with lighter, Duh..) and throw at hard object such as:
 house, wall, car, street, rock, enemy, gas station, etc...
    
............................................
 (> ROCKET ENGINE TORCH/SPRAY PAINT <)
 
 1. Take engine and mount onto a board, about handsized. This can be done
various ways, but make sure the bottom is at the end of the board.
 2. Light the engine, this sport is more for Kamakazis so watch out.
 3. Hold onto the opisite side of the board than the side the flame of the engine is comin' from. Now you can torch anything in sight or, burn something like "Adam Hudson sucks!"into Adam's House. The whole thing goes preety fast, so I advise more than one rocket to use.
   
............................................
  (> WD-40 TORCH <)

 1. This is simple, and most probably know this one already, but, take your
aeresole can and your lighter.
 2. Hold your lighter out about half a foot from your can and light it. Let
the WD-40 rip, and aim it at enemy. Watch him D I E !!
 3. Also, observe how the flame slowly climbs its way up the spray? See what
happens if you let it continue and enter the can. Yup'! You guessed it, 
 B  O  O  M ! ! ! 
  Don't let it happen!

..........................................    
 (> CLOSING CEREMONIES <)

 1. The day of fire is ending, all that remains is your lighter. But wait! 
Pyroin' isn't over! First, take the lighter, and tape down the gas. Now, 
tape it upsidedown on your fence.
 2. Now, roll the flint, causing it to light. and then get back.
 3. A few minutes later puts an end to all evidence of your pyromania.
