                       ==>/Burning Hydorgen Bomb\<==
 
 Materials:
         A bottle, hydrogen gas, gunpowder, paper, cap to bottle, fuse.
 (an electric fuse works better)
 
 Construction:
         Fill the bottle with hydrogen, and then put the paper in as a seal
 just before the bottle gets wider. Now put the gunpowder on top of the paper,
 and stick your fuse in the gunpowder.  Put the cap on, running the fuse under
 it, and it's done.  When the gunpowder goes off, it will light the hydrogen,
 whitch should give you a nice explosion.
