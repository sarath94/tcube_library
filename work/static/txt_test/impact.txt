                       General Information
 
     Frictional  Impact  Explosive  is  extremely  sensitive   to
Pressure,  heat, friction, and the shock of impact.  Though  safe
in  its  moist and cream state, an insect walking  across  a  dry
portion  of  it will set off a loud explosion.  A  pencil  eraser
sized piece would put the loudest fire cracker to shame, while  a
thimble full would rival a stick of Dynamite.  This explosive  is
just  as  powerful  as  it is  loud   so  treat  it  accordingly,
especially when dry.
 
                             Formula
 
      Here is the chemical formula for the above reaction:
     4P+4KCIOthird = 2PsecondOfifth+2KCI+Osecond+E (ENERGY)
 
 
              Materials required for Manufacture
 
      * An  Eyedropper               * A small Prescription bottle
      * A sheet of NewsPaper         * Amorphous Red PhosPhorus
      * A chemical Spatula           * Potassium Chlorate
 
 
                  Preparation Procedure
 
     Cut out a double piece (8x8) of newspaper and place it on  a
smooth surface.  Pour a small amount of water on this paper  mat,
smearing  it  around thoroughly moisten the mat.  Now  ,  in  one
corner,  place  a pile of Amorphous Red Phosphorus; one  part  by
weight  and  in  the opposite corner place a  pile  of  Potassium
Chlorate; two parts by weight.
     Fill  the eyedropper and put just enough water on each  pile
to  moisten  it.  With the chemical spatula, mix each  damp  pile
into an even paste.  When each pile is smooth and free of  lumps,
scrape the two chemicals together, combining the white and purple
pastes  into  a mixture of uniform color.  The best  results  are
obtained  from a well mixed batch so be sure that you  have  done
this part well.
     With  mixing completed, scrape the wet explosive and put  it
into  a  small prescription bottle before snapping  on  the  lid.
Storing  the explosive in this way will keep it from drying  out,
and  its freshness will last for an extended period of time.   Be
sure  to  wash off the paper mat before disposing of it  and  the
other  equipment should be thoroughly washed and dried  as  well.
You  are  now ready to use Fictional Impact Explosive;  Here  are
some applications:
 
 
                          Security Bomb
 
     Cut  a  newspaper  into  strips 1"x5" and place  a  glob  of
Frictional Impact Explosives near one end.  Make an "S" shape  as
shown  in  Fig I.  Embedded this double loop of  string   in  the
explosive  as shown, and roll tightly, beginning at the end  with
the  explosive.  Secure the roll with cellophane tape and let  it
dry  for  a few hours.  When dry, these bombs  are  detonated  by
grasping the ends of the three foot string which is now  embedded
in a dry explosive, and jerking them quickly.  Pulling the string
causes friction within the explosive, thus detonating the bomb.
 
 
                          Smoke Screen
 
     Roll  a  small  glob  of  Frictional  Impact  Explosives  in
Ammonium  Chloride  to  form  a  semi-firm  ball  about  1/4"  in
diameter.  Then cover the ball with a 1/8" layer, and let dry for
an  hour  or so.  To detonate, simply throw on to  the  floor  or
against a wall and a thick, heavy smoke screen is produced.   One
ball  of  the  size  described will easily  fill  a  small  room.
Another  interesting characteristic of this application  is  that
the smoke produced affects humans in much the same way that  tear
gas does.  One or two balls will clear out a room of people fast.
These are very effective  against dogs and thugs.
 
 
                         Impact Grenades
 
     Grind some uncooked rice or tapioca(the easiest to grind) to
use as a moisture absorbent in the following application.  Obtain
some gelatin capsules ( The kind medicine comes in) and fill  the
large  half  of  the capsule with  semi-moist  frictional  Impact
Explosive.  The smaller half should likewise be filled half  full
of  the  moisture absorbent  then placed upon  the  larger  half.
When  the two halves have been slid together, lick the  joint  to
insure   an  air  tight  seal.   These  will  be  ready   in   24
hours.(Enlarge portions for a more powerful explosion)
 
 
                           Further Info
 
     Using  the basic Principles described here you  should  very
easily  be able to create your own ideas for a better  Frictional
Impact  Explosive  use.  If you wish to learn of  more  uses  you
should be able to find me on most Bulletin Boards around the U.S.
