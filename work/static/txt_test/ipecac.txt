  Ipecac as we all know is a vomit inducer that is used when poison is ingested
(ie: swallowed). Because it is a fairly commonly stocked item you should have
no trouble in obtaining a bottle or two with ease. The idea behind using it is
for the really graphic disgusting jokes which disruput dailly routine quite 
effectively.
 You can administer it to various people for entertaining effects such as:
   o add to school faculty's food & drink for lunch time 'disturbances'.(can 
     you picture the entire faculty tossing their cookies in unison. then they
     would naturally leave as they are all so desperately ill (ha), leaving the
     school without enough substitutes.)
   o use it yourself to avoid unpleasant exams.
   o use to target your favorite teachers or classmates. 10pt for Mrs. Simmons.
     20pt for facial hits. etc...
   o use your imagination.....
 And since ipecac is safe to use, you cant be accused of poisoning others or
using controlled substances yourself. It is truly the Anarchists friend....
