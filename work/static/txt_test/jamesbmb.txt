This file is written for informational purposes only,  
  
Materials: 
  
  1-liter or 2-liter plastic soda bottles 
  aluminum foil 
  printed circuit board etchant (available at Radio Shack, or other electronics  
  stores) 
           
Method: 
  
Somehow obtain a few 1 or 2 liter bottles (we prefer the 1-liter size).  Shred  
aluminum foil into small strips about 1X2 inches.  Fill bottle with strips  
until the bottle is about 1/4 full.  When ready to detonate, pour in enough  
etchant to fill the bottom of the coke bottle about 1/2 inch deep.  As quickly  
as possible screw the cap back on, and make sure it is on tight.  Then throw  
the bottle at your intended target, and run like hell is on fire.  When enough  
pressure has built up, ***BOOM***.  If it doesn't explode, do not pick it up.   
Because it is VERY hot, and it could still explode if disturbed. 
  
Convenient locations to serve you: 
  
Mr. Neighbor's mailbox- slide one of these little monsters in and quickly  
close the door.  After this, Mr. Postman will have to hand deliver the mail to  
Mrs. Neighbor. 
  
School Lockers- makes an awesome mess. 
  
Mr. Neighbor's pool- guaranteed to keep the kids out of the pool until it has  
been drained and refilled. 
  
  
Variations: 
  
Strength- the etchant can be diluted with water to control the reaction time. 
  
Pure etchant is excellent for eating away Mr. Neighbor's over-chromed  
Cadillac. 
  
It always makes a permanent mess on Mr. Neighbor's driveway too. 
  
This is an awesome variation for those "friends" who know about these devices.   
Substitute the new coke, or any other dark cola for the etchant.  Throw this  
device into the area, that they are sitting in and watch them run for the  
hills.  They'll think it's "The Real Thing." 
  
  
  
Warnings: 
  
It is easier to pour the etchant into an empty plastic dishwashing bottle  so  
it makes it easier to pour. 
  
Etchant has a tendnancy to permanently stain any clothes it touches. 
  
Unless you are suicidal, DO NOT use glass bottles!!  They have a nasty habit 
of exploding at very unpredictable times. 
  
All etchants are not of the same strength so, try and use one brand and stick  
with it.
