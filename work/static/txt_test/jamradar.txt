Ahhh! You're cruising down the city Hill at 90 Mph. You're
on top of the world with the wind whistling through your hair.
When suddenly you're pulled over by an by a Police Officer
named McCracken. How did he see you? How did he know you WERE
going +90Mph down Crash Hill? The Obvious answer is that he 
used a radar detector and they have been the demise of speed
demons of the road.
	People like to be bad when nobody is watching and
those darn pesky Radar Detectors just put and end to your fun.
Those who like to be bad, can either find a new hobby or they
will  arm  them  selves  with  an  expensive  radar  detector.
However this device will not work against a  gun  type   radar
unit in which the radar signal is not present  until  the  cop
has you car in his sights and pull the trigger.  Then  it   is
too late to slow down. A better method is to continously   jam
any signal with a radar signal of your  own.  I  have   tested
this idea with the cooperation of a local cop and  found  that
his unit reads random numbers when your car approached    him.
It is suprisingly easy to make a low power radar  transmitter.
A nifty  little  semiconductor  called  a  Gunn  diode    will
generate microwaves  when  supplied  with  5  to  10  vdc  and
enclosed in the correct size cavity (resonator).  An  8  to  3
terminal regulator can be used to get  this  voltage  from   a
car's system. H owever the correct construction and tuning  of
the cavity is difficult without  good  microwave   measurement
equipment. Police radars commonly operate on the K band at  22
ghz. or more often  on  the  X  band  at  10.525  ghz.    Most
microwave intruder alarms and moti on detectors (mounted  over
automatic doors in supermarkets, etc. ) contain  a  Gunn  type
transmitter/receiver combination  that  transmits  about    10
milliwatts at  10.525  ghz.  These  units  work  perfectly  as
jammers. If you can't  get  one  locally  write  to  Microwave
Associates in Burlington, Mass. and ask for info on "Gunnplexe
rs" for ham radio use. When you get the unit it may be mounted
in a plastic box on the dash or in  a  weatherproof  enclosure
behi nd the plastic grille. Switch on the power  when  on  the
open hig hway. The unit will not jam  radar  to  the  side  of
behind the car so don't go speeding past the  radar  trap.  An
interesting phenomena you will  notice  is  that  drivers   in
front of you who are u sing detectors will hit their brakes as
you approach large metal signs  or  bridges.  Your  signal  is
bouncing off these objects  and  triggering  their  detectors.
