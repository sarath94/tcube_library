	Hello and welcome to July time....the 4th of July on any day 
  with a little pizzaz...I hope you enjoy issue #1 and please leave me
  feedback! Thanx!

	There are MANY ways to have fun with firecrackers....but the best
  are when you can actually use them. My favorite ways are the Tube, the
  rocket, and the big bang. I will explain each one as follows.

	In this issue we discuss the TUBE method....which is rather safe
  and easy to use.	

	The tube us a relatively normal arrangement...just that all the 
  bottle rockets should go off at the same time. But what you do is take 
  three or four bottle rockets (the kind with the plastic caps) and fill 
  the caps with some type of contact explosive. Then tape them all together 
  with duct or electric tape. Then tie all the fuses together and place 
  into a metal tube. Light fuse and have fun....try not to blow off your 
  hand or other body part! By the way....you do not really need to fill
  the cap with an explosive....but it add's to the BANG!!
