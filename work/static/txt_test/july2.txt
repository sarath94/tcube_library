	Hello! And welcome to issue #2 of Firecracker FUN! In this issue
  we will discuss The Rocket.

	Materials:   A 2 or 3 Stage Rocket
		     Superglue
		     Tape
		     Shredded Paper
		     M-80 firecracker
                     All other equipment for launching
   
	Any 2 or 3 stage rocket will work fine. You must be willing to 
  to loose a rocket so I suggest not painting, because it would be just
  a waste of time and money. You can get a good 3 stage rocket for under
  $30 and the M-80's you can buy at almost any firecracker store for 
  between $.80 - $1.00!!

	First put the rocket together. Then place the boosters in the 
  bottom stage(s). In the uppermost stage glue the M-80 into place with
  the fuse pointing downward. Place the end of the fuse onto the upper 
  part of the adjoining booster and tape it into place with a small piece
  of tape. Fill the paracute area sparcely with shredded paper. Wait until
  the glue holding the M-80 dries and then finish putting the rocket 
  together. Now you are ready to go! But be smart...don't launch the rocket
  in someone's face or into a building unless you are willing to take
  responsibility for it! And try not to kill yourself in the process!

	
	What is supposed to happen is as you launch the rocket the first
  stage's booster burns with an extremely high intensty and heat. As the
  booster nears the to it ignites a flameable substance that pushes upward
  igniting the booster above it and ejecting it from the rest of the rocket.
  When the substance shoots upward into the M-80 it will ignite the fuse or
  it will detonate the M-80 immediatly (I am not sure which). Then as the 
  M-80 detonates it will blow the cap of the rocket off ejecting anything
  in the paracute chamber.


   BBBBOOOOOOO>   <---- Place booster in the bottom stage(s)

   BBBBM-80OOO>   <---- Glue M-80 in stage above booster and tape fuse

   BBBBM-80PPP>   <---- Put shredded paper in paracute chamber


  Coming soon....Issue #3 discussing The BIG BANG!!!!


  HAVE FUN AND BE CAREFUL!!!
