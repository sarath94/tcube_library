	Hello!! Welcome to issue #3, which is about the Big BANG!! Which
  is one of the most dangerous to the person setting it up (YOU!)!

	Materials:  10-15 M-80's
	            Long fuse...2 feet
	            Duct or Electric Tape
		    LUCK!!!

	Ok. Now. Put all the M-80's into a circle packed as tightly 
  together as possible. Next put two or even three layers of tape arround
  the group of M-80's. Connect all the fuses together pointing inward and
  tie (If you tape it use as little tape as possible) it to the long 
  piece of fuse. Then pace upright or if you want to have fun, bury it a
  foot underground (if you do this you must have a straw or a pipe leading
  the fuse into the ground) and light the fuse. Now what you have here is 
  like two or three sticks of dynamite, so get as far away as possible 
  and hit the ground!! The explosion will be a HELL of a lot louder than
  a small stick of dynamite so cover your ears, don't be a hero and go 
  deaf!

      This is really the most dangerous of my firecracker ones to the maker
  of the Big Bang, because it is like a few sticks of dynamite!!
