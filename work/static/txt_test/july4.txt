	Hello! And welcome to issue #4, which starts the series of
  Bathroom Bombs! In this issue we discuss The Candle! 

	Materials:  A birthday or other small candle
	            1 M-80
	            Silly Putty


	Here we go. Scrape off the bottom of the candle so that a half-
  inch wick in on the bottom. Tie the end of the wick to the fuse of the 
  M-80. Place a small ammount of silly putty on one side of the candle,
  and a small ammount on one side of the M-80. Use as little as possible,
  just enough to make it stick! Now the hard part, you need to lean over 
  and stick the candle and the M-80 to the underside of the toilet. Be
  careful and make sure no one is going to dunk you. Light the candle and
  get out of the bathroom as calmly as possible. You have anywhere from
  thirty seconds to one minute (30-1) so you have time to wash your hands 
  and act normal. Make sure that you are nowhere NEAR the bathroom because
  the teachers will interogate anyone in the vicinity of the area!!

	But remember to be careful and use EXTREME caution becuase you are
  at scholl and they will suspend you if they catch you....I have never
  been caught, but my friend has....so be smart...have fun!
