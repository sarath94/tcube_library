	Welcome to issue #5 about The Cigarette Flash, which is another 
  neat little way to have a BLAST at school (Literally)!!


	Materials:  Filterless Cigarette
	            Lighter
                    Small Viel of Thinner
	            Matchbook

	This on is FUN! Splash the thinner all over the toilet paper in the
  stall. Open the matchbook and place the cigarette in the match book so 
  that the matchbook holds the cigarette in place firmly. Place the 
  combination matchbook/cigarette under the toilet paper any way you can fit
  it in there. Now the fun part. Light the cigarette and get out of the stall 
  calmly. With this you have between two and five minutes (2-5) so you have
  plenty of time to act normal and leave the bathroom at a steady pace!!

  yourself unless you want to burn in hell (Pun)!!
