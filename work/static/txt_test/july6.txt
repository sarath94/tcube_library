	Hello! And welcome to...ummm...issue #6 of Firecracker FUN! In
  this issue we will discuss the FLAMER which is the final issue of mild
  firecracker fun. The next 5-8 issues will be called: "Flaming GLORY!"
  and will hols some more potent things OTHER THAN firecrackers and oil!
  Sooo....I hope that you enjoyed this series and I REALLY hope that you
  look forward to all my future series and issues!

	Materials:  1/4 gallon gasoline
		    1/4 gallon oil
		    6 inch candle
		    LOTS of toilet paper!!!

	This one is scary....and FUN! At home mix the 1/4 gallon of 
  gasoline with the 1/4 gallon of oil. Place the mixture in a gallon bag
  that is easy to conceal. At school put the toilet paper in the toilet 
  until it reaches the level of the water. Take the candle and place it 
  firmly into the toilet paper so that it will stay upright for about 5
  minutes. After all that slowly pour the mixture gas/oil into the toilet.
  Light the candle and you will have 10-15 minutes to get out. This one is
  pretty scary if you are in the bathroom at the time! There is NO noise 
  but if you are anywhere NEAR the stall you will see a LARGE flame leap
  up into the air!! KEWL!

	Sorry....I cannot really show any examples! This one you can be   
  REALLY creative with!!!!

  BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET CAUGHT!!!!
