In this file I will explain how to make giant Jumping jacks. The needed supplies for
this are 1 Plastic View master case (the round thing the slides sheets are stored on),
or something about the same. Some SLOW Burning Gun powder, and a small, or large fu
se. 

Take the view master case dish thingy, hold it up and look at the bottom.... you should
see two small holes about big enough for a wick to go through. Put the wick through one
of those holes. Plug the other hole up with glue. Using some type of small dril
l bit bore holes on the sides, One on each. Now fill the dish with gunpowder. You will
have to experiment to get the exact amount. Put the lid on. With glue fasten the lid
on the dish so it will Never Come off.

Light the wick. Now depending on the size of your holes a good amount of sparks should
be coming out and the thing will be spinning and melting at the same time. 

If you still don't understand what I mean by a view master dish, it's those dishes
shaped like petris dishes.
