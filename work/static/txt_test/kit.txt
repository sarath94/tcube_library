Terrorism Kit

Assembly of the versatile, economic, and effective Terrorist Kit #1:
The parts you'll need are:
 1) 4 AA Batteries
 2) 1 9-Volt Battery
 3) 1 SPDT Mini Relay (Radio Shack)
 4) 1 Rocket Engine(Smoke Bomb or M-80)
 5) 1 Solar Ignitor (any hobby store)
 6) 1 9-Volt Battery connector

Step 1:  Take the 9-volt battery and wire it through the relay's coil.
  This circuit should also include a pair of contacts that when separated
  cut off this circuit.  These contacts should be held together by trapping
  them between the locker,mailbox, or car door.  Once the door is opened,
  the contacts fall apart and the 9-volt circuit is broken, allow-
  ing the relay to fall to the close  postion thus closing the ignition
  circuit. (If all this is confusing take a look at the schematic below.)

Step 2: Take the 4 AA batteries and wire them in succession.  Wire the
  positive terminal of one to the negative terminal of another, until
  all four are connected except one positive terminal and one negative
  terminal.  Even though the four AA batteries only combine to create
  6 volts, the increase in amperage is necessary to activate the solar
  ignitor quickly and effectively.

Step 3:  Take the battery pack (made in step 2) and wire one end of it
  to the relay's single pole and the other end to one prong of the solar
  ignitor.  Then wire the other prong of the solar ignitor back to the
  open position on the relay.

Step 4:  Using double sided carpet tape mount the kit in his locker, mailbox,
  or car door.  And last, insert the solar ignitor into the rocket engine
  (smoke bomb or M-80).

     Your kit is now complete!
