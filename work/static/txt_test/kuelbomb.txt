 
A Kuel Bomb 
 
Ingredients: 
 
1. Glass or plastic coke bottle. 
2. 1 can of CRYSTAL draino, NOT LIQUID 
Draino! 
3. Some aluminum foil. 
4. A cup of water. 
 
Preparation: 
 
    (Make sure the bottle has a cap!). 
Fill the bottle 1 fourth to 1 thirds of 
the way with CRYSTAL draino. 
    Get the aluminum foil and make 
about 7-10 balls of it that will fit 
into the bottle, then put them into the 
bottle... 
    Now, get the cup of water and pour 
it into the bottle. After this is done, 
quickly screw the cap on as tight as 
possible. Now shake the bottle, throw 
it, or whatever, just so the contents 
get mixed together. What will happen is 
it will get so hot in the bottle that 
it will have to blow up... With a 
plastic bottle you have about 15 
seconds before detonation, with a glass 
bottle you have anywhere from 30 
seconds to a minute...  Have Phun...
