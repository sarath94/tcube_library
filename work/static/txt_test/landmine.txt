           How to Make a Landmine

First you need to get a push button
switch... take the wires of it and
connect one to a 9 volt battery
connector and the other to a solar
igniter (if you can't get that then use
a thin piece of stereo wire).

Connect the other wire of the 9 volt
connector to to the other end of the
solar igniter (stereo wire).

Now... connect the end of a fuse (of
a pipe bomb, M80, whatever has a fuse)
to the solar igniter...

Dig a hole... not to deep but enough to
cover all the materials. Think about
what direction your enemy will coming
from and plant the switch, but leave
the button visible (not to visible).
Plant the explosive about 3 feet from
the switch because there will be a
delay in the explosion.
And when your enemy steps on it...
