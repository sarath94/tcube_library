This is a transcript from everyone's favorite talk show : "Talk Back - with 
Bob Larson". 

On this date (i have no idea... i  think it was in May) Bob was "discussing" 
the dangers of pot.   And everybody's favorite Sysop  -  the Sorcerer (Ryan) 
(of the Necropolis  216-966-8970) decided to call in and share  his POV with 
Bob...  

Bob - I got Ryan on the line in Canton, Ohio.
Ryan - Hello there, Bob.
Bob - Ryan!
Ryan - Hi.
Bob - What's on your mind, Ryan?
Ryan - Well, you know how you're all concerned about Clinton's Big Government,
       Big Brother, Megastate, or whatever now?
Bob - Yeah.
Ryan - Well, I think that you're upholding one of the basic strongholds of 
       Big Government today.
Bob - Really.
Ryan - Illegalization of pot.
Bob - What?!
Ryan - Making pot illegal is an infringement on individual rights.
Bob - It's an infringement?
Ryan - Yeah.
Bob - Did it ever occur to you, sir, does this drug induced society that 
      you want to promote is an infringement upon the freedoms of the 
      rest of us who when we ...
Ryan - Oh no, no...
Bob - No, no.  Listen to me, listen to me, Ryan!  Who when we drive 
      down a highway...
Ryan -Yeah.
Bob - Would like to do so FREE...
Ryan - mm, hmm..
Bob - ... from the fear ...
Ryan - Yeah.
Bob- ... that some idiot behind the wheel of the car headed toward us 
     on that two lane country road didn't smoke a joint before he got behind 
     the wheel and isn't smoking one while he's driving.
Ryan - Oh well....
Bob- ... the rest of us god-fearing americans would like to be free from ...
Ryan - If you would...
Bob - the foul-mouth rappers who are encouraging crime in the street, and 
      popolding (?) an image of some gold-medal draped... rapper who 
      can't put two sentences together intelligently with a marijuana leaf 
      in his cap, being a role-model for the youth of the inner-city..  we'd 
      like to be free from that!
Ryan - Well in that case, let's make, let's make tobacco illegal, let's make 
       alcohol illegal, in fact let's make Gatorade illegal, because if 
       you drink to much of that it'll make you irresponsible on the road.
       The fact is, that...
Bob - Well obviously, obviously.
Ryan - The use of marijuana is not the problem.  The irresponsible use of 
       marijuana is what causes people to be reckless on the road.  
Bob- Sir.
Ryan - And your facts are just horrible.
Bob - Sir.
Ryan - The 70% child abuse?
Bob - Sir, sir.
Ryan - It's 60%... it's too high.
Bob - (he had been saying "sir" about twenty times while Ryan was trying 
      to make a point) Obviously, obviously, obviously...
Ryan - It's a lie.
Bob - It's obviously with what you're saying, that lack of intelligent 
      rhetoric behind it.  You've had too much Gatorade and we 
      shouldn't talk anymore... i've got Rich on the line in Denver....
