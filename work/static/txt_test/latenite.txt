     First off, you need some supplies. Such as:

  A car...V8 engine                     Steel cable, or very strong rope
  Fireworks..M80's,inch1/2's,rockets    Heavy-duty wire cutters
  BB guns..2....Co2 or pump             A hack-saw
  16 pennie nails...2 doz.              Impact Explosives...optional

     Otay,  Now that we have all our supplies we can get out of the house
 and reap some havoc on your home city. Get out of the house anyway you
 can. Pick up some friends and snacks, pop, beer, etc...

      First stop
      <><><><><>

      A residentual area that you just don't seem to like. As you drive by the
 beautiful houses stop by every nice car that is parked in the street. Take out
 the M-80 and place it between the rubber seal and the window. Look around some
 more. If nobody is around light the fuse and get away. I suggest FAR away, and
 as you are darting down the street you hear a little pop as the explosives
 implode the cars window all over the inside of the car. Now wont that be a
 mess to clean up in the morning. Now find another area to check and see if the
 car door opens. Ah..so it does open..well..why don't you grab the cutters and
 cut the locks, seat belts, stearing wheel, wires under the dash board, and all
 those little knobs you control the heat, radio, and wipers with. Now on your
 way out of the car go ahead and place another M-80 with an extra long fuse in
 the glove conpartment. Make sure all those maps are out of there ( we wouldn't
want to start a fire. ).


        Second stop
        <><><><><><

     Now aren't we getting thirsty. Let go find a pop machine. Hey! what is
 that on the right? A phone booth? Let pay a call on it. Take the BB guns and
 shoot out all the windows. Next time someone makes a call from that phone
 boot it should be pretty hard to hear. Finally a pop machine. And look it's
 even in bottles. Sixty cents! Thats way to much for a pop. Tip the machine
 over on its front and listen smooth cruble of the bottles inside as it hits
 the ground. If any money falls out consider it a refund for that pop you
 didn't get.

      Third stop
      <><><><><>

     As we are passing behind our favorite hotel, but what to our wandering
 eyes should appear but some pop canisters filled with foamy root-beer.
 After passing the canisters storage location we noticed that all the canisters
 were gone and had mystically appeard in our truck. Hmm? So we to a parking
 lot in front of a small corporation. And took one of the canisters and
 attached it to the rear of our vehicle. Now with our master driver at the
 wheel we drug the canister around the local residentual district. Knocking
 the canister into various fire-hydrants, lightpoles, mailboxes, and other
 objects protruding from the earth we manage to jam the canister under some
 poor sapps automobile. Now repeat this procedure with the remaining canisters.

     Fourth stop
     <><><><><><

      You know that supermarket that leaves the crates for milk and stuff out
 on the docks. Well as long as we have the cable go ahead and slide the cable
 threw all 50 of the crates and twist the cable on the last crate. Now jump
 in our verhicle and slowly drive away. Now that all 50 of the crates are
 skipping and smashing into things behind you go ahead and her some gas. Lets
 whip around that turn coming up and smack that car. Now find an intersection
 with no cops and stop in the middle. One of your friends jumps out cuts the
 cable and jumps back in. As you drive off you notice 40 or 50 crates in the
 intersection have hit several cars fairly hard. (gosh, wonder if the crates
 are alright? )

     Fifth stop
     <><><><><>

       A golf course. Let's turn the lights off so we can approach the course
 unseen. (most courses have a caretakers house) apoint your friends certain
 flags to get. (ok..mark get 1-6, Cris get 7-11, Eric get 12-18) And now Mike
 gets 1-18 in his front yard. Be sure to dig little holes in his front yard
 too.

     Sixth stop
     <><><><><>

      Another residentual district with lots of cars parked in the street.
 Park your car about a block away and walk by every car and place one nail
 under the front and the back of the back tires. Next morning when everyone
 gets in their car and then has to change the back tire.

     Seventh stop
     <><><><><><>

      That old school you went to and hated so much. Lets find a nice place
 to park. You see all those doors all the way around the building. Those doors
 are for people to get out in case of a fire. Well we're not going to use them
 like that. Check all the doors and find the door that opens the widest. (the
doors have chains on the inside holding them together tight enough so nobody
 can get in without a hack-saw. Now let get to class on time(yeah..to saw the
 desks into very, very, tiny peices. Oh shit...I haven't seen the schools new
 computer room. Well lets go to that room. We bust the window and unlock the
 door from the inside. We walk inside and find 2 c-64's and 4 TRaSh 80's. Well
 We have some m-80's left and some bottle rockets and some inchers and a extra-
 long fuse. Doesn't every teacher have tape in their drawer? Yup. Tape the
 fireworks onto one of the 'calculators' and tie the fuse. On your way out lets
 smash some screens and light the fuse. Now fly down the stairs get in the car
 and lets go home. It is about 5:OO am and the sun is rising over the horizon.
