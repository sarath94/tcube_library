                 *** PHUN AT THE LAUNDRYMAT! ***
                   ***************************

Me and me good budy were sittin round at the mat, smokin' away,
when the manager comes along and tells us to get the hell out.
His mistake!  Here's a bunch of good ways to wreak havok at the
laundry mat... ENJOY!

1.   Get some krazy glue and glue the locks where they get the
     phreakin money out of the machine and glue em good.  This
     *really* ticks them off, but doesn't cause that much damage.

2.   Get a hand phul of bullets(.22 is nice) and throw em in the
     dryer.  Shut the door, and glue it if you can.  Then,
     deposit some cash, and RUN LIKE HELL!  It'll take some time
     for them to go off (usually), but you don't want to be
     around.

3.   Toss anything that stinks into the dryer.  Sulpher works
     great, but even rotten eggs or a nice bag of fresh dog shit
     does just as well.  When the dryer heats up, it'll stink up
     the whole damn place.  Another trick is dumping gas or gear
     oil in and lighting it.  This is more dangerous, as it may
     cause short-circuits in the heating elements causing an
     electrical fire.

4.   Toss something in the washers to phuck people up.  People
     generally don't take a hard look in an unused washer.  They
     just open it up to see if there's any clothes in there, then
     use it.  Try dumping some motor oil in, or some strong food
     colouring (the paste-stuff is best).  The best thing would
     be a bright acrylic paint (not water-based!)

5.   If you can get at it, find out where the drainage hose is at
     the back of the washer... usually just a black hose on the
     rear-left (sometimes right) side.  If you *can* see it,
     slash it or just poke a big hole in it.  Next time somebody
     uses the washer they'll end up with about 10+ gallons of
     water on the floor.  Twice that if nobody notices and it
     goes through the rinse cycle too!

6.   Too bad washers/dryers don't make change.  Thier coin
     identification process is notoriously poor.  So you should
     be able to feed it slugs without any problem, especially
     older models.  Hey, at least you get a few free washes!

7.   Go outside and find the dryer vent, and plug it up tightly
     with something (soaked rags work well).  These vents are
     where the dryer gets rid of the moisture.  When it's plugged
     up, it'll take forever for things to dry!

8.   If there are washers that let you select a cycle, change the
     cycle in mid-wash, or just turn it off.  This won't cause
     much problem, but it might make someone have to dish out
     extra cash... and complain to the asshole manager.

9.   Go around to all the washers/dryers and krazy glue all the
     coin slots (where you put your money in).  This'll really
     phuck 'em up worse than putting glue in the key slot (1). 
     With they key-slot, they can always break it open, and put
     on a makeshift lock (two holes, a peice of pipe and a
     padlock'll work great).  This way, they can't make *any*
     money until they get them repaired or replaced.  Use PLENTY
     of glue for best results.  Epoxy (harder to break out) would
     be better, but takes to long to dry.

10.  Some other ideas would be to simply shoot the manager with a
     .45, or plant a thermonuclear device in the dryer.  These
     would only be for someone who's *really* obsessed with
     laundrymat destruction... who should get themselves some
     help!

       Add some more if you can think of any!  Have Phun!
