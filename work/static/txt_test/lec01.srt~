00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
The goals for this course is to introduce you to the field of artificial intelligence

6
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
I want to explain to you the challenges that in harold in building a system that

7
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
That can be considered to be intelligent in this course will be explaining

8
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
The key paradigms of artificial intelligence that code techniques and technologies the dangers

9
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
And outcomes for some of this techniques

10
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
The instructional objectives of the scores on taking the scores

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
You should be able to understand the role of basic knowledge representation

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
How to represent our knowledge about the world

13
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
I knowledge of problem solving techniques

14
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,256
And a knowledge of some of the learning methods in ai

15
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,888
And we will see how these are used to solve

16
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
Different problems and to build a complete intelligent system

17
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
Onclick the scores you should be able to assess the applicable

18
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
The strengths and weaknesses of these methods of the different techniques that we discuss

19
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,208
Tvs cash the strengths of this

20
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
Method and situations where this methods can be applied to solve this entire

21
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,448
Types of problems that requires intelligence

22
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
Evelyn

23
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
How to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions 2

24
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
Concrete computational problems the way we will do it is we will look at the different

25
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
Components of intelligence and for each of these we will discuss ways

26
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,560
Of solving this problems

27
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
And then

28
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Depending on the

29
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
The full system the functionality of the system that you wish to

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
Constructed engineers you can put together some of these solutions to get the phone

31
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504

Today's lecture will be the first letter in the series

59
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
The first module for this course is the introduction

60
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,479
And today's lecture is the first lesson this module which is introduction to eye

61
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,855
Let's come to the objectives of today's lecture

62
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
Instructional objectives of todays lecherous

63
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Daman

64
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
To understand the definition of artificial intelligence what are artificial intelligence is what is it about

65
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
Sexually

66
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Discussing

67
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,615
The different faculties that involve to the telligent behaviour

68
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,455
Different components that define intelligence

69
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
We will also be examining

70
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
The different ways of approaching

71
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
And

72
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
Finally we will also look at

73
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,887
Some example systems that have been constructed at a well-known popularly known

74
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
Which user

75
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
And lastly

76
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:39,615
We will also take them please look at the history of life

77
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,831
On taking this lesson you should become familiar with the different way

78
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:54,207
Ways of defining artificial intelligence as you see different people

79
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,535
Define digestion tea and we will

80
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
Family services with this definition

81
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Secondly

82
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,287
As i mentioned we try to understand the different components of intelligent behaviour

83
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Objective of today's lecturers also to let you develop an appreciation of

84
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Scope of artificial intelligence

85
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,903
And special actual challenges that are there in the field

86
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
On clicking on

87
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Checking today's

88
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
Cause you should be able to have a fair idea

89
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Of the types of bra

90
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
Problems that can be current is solved by the computer centre days techniques that without today

91
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,919
And we will also have an idea of those problems that is still

92
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
Difficult or we can not yet solve it by the techniques that we know today

93
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,999
Zombies are the four main components of today's lecture

94
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Definition of examples of storms approaches to a brief history first

95
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,727
Nominal take up the definition of you

96
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
Now what is artificial intelligence there is too many definitions of the store

97
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Floating around

98
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
Ssc or what is clear from being towards artificial intelligence

99
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
Ask your p**** that guy is concerned with the design of in

100
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Intelligence

101
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
As the first of artificial

102
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
Actually concerned with the design of intelligence in artificial artefacts in arctic

103
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
Usa systems artificial systems are man-made systems and building intelligence

104
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
The storm was coined by mcafee

105
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
In 1956 in a famous conference the tasmark conference which we will have a patient

106
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Talk about late

107
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
Now

108
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,919
The term artificial a visa to understand but what is intelligence

109
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,063
It's very difficult to define intelligence

110
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
V

111
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,183
Look at some people look at intelligence as

112
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
Something that characterizes humans

113
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
If you take human beings to be intelligent you can say artificial intelligence

114
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,543
Means having behaviour which is like a human

115
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,199
In fact there are two schools of thought he assam people

116
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
Ideas to have a machine or have a system that behaves like a human

117
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
On the other school of thought is too

118
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,839
Humans are not always welcome period

119
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Even though human survive

120
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Actually present elephant bath tab all the time 2 minutes to not be heaven telogen 3 so

121
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
School of thought

122
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
Is that artificial intelligence concerns with

123
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
Set intelligence which is the ideal audi

124
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
Best behaviour of the most rational behaviour

125
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
It is the machine should behave centre

126
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
Best possible man

127
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Charmi the definition when we talk about their behaviour

128
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
What sort of behavioral talking about there are two main types of behaviour that people will like

129
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,103
Talk about number 1 is thinking

130
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Thinking intelligence

131
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,479
Listen properly and intelligence in order to

132
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
Stomach weather solutions

133
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
And the second

134
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Approach

135
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,463
Talk about not thinking but acting how the system

136
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
Actually apps apk

137
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Service

138
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
We can talk about intelligence as something that characterizes human or something that means behave

139
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
The best possible manner of behaving rational

140
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Again we can talk about

141
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Intelligent intelligence and thought on intelligence in action

142
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,439
Based on this criterion we can

143
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,839
Look at the different ways of defining so we may look at thought process

144
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
Process behaviour women look at human live performance

145
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
Pisces ideal rational performance

146
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
And this app

147
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
Shows the four different

148
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
Definition set image

149
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Zombies 2 dark thomas

150
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,487
So on the one hand we have

151
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Thotta reasoning vs behaviour on the other hand we have human like performance vs ideal proforma

152
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,567
Software systems that think like humans

153
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
For example

154
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
Vvs cars

155
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
The famous turing test which is device by alan turing

156
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Weather

157
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,975
Assistant pastor turing test would be a system that

158
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
Besides like a human of things like a human

159
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,447
The second definition is systems that think rationally

160
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
The

161
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
School of thoughts there

162
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
Justin papers

163
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,527
Mathematician cen computer scientists have worked on logic

164
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Laws of thought

165
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Police interceptor watch

166
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
Tera systems that act like humans

167
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
Causes of scientists look at

168
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
The properties of systems

169
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,895
That act like humans and finally we have the definition systems that

170
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
Jacs vaishnavi or systems that act in the best possible manner

171
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,671
And for this we have other approaches

172
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,535
Constructing a rational agent and agency tax classes

173
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,935
Alan turing considered by many to be the father of uae

174
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,799
Define the turing test

175
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,895
In the turing test

176
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
This is experimental setup better device

177
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,343
Set up a closed room in this closed room there will be

178
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
Abhi which

179
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Maybe a computer

180
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
And it may be a human

Does not know

186
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,663
Weather the being inside the room is a computer and human so what i do

187
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Status

188
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Is that

189
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Ask

190
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Questions

191
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,951
And the human being inside the room

192
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Processes this question

193
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,119
Aj returns up answer

194
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,519
At the interview getters on the left room to receive the answers on the screen

195
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
Now this has to make out from the answers whether the being inside the room

196
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,295
Whether it is a computer on human

197
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,671
Now it is a computer inside the room the computer tries to

198
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
Xx together that it

199
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,143
Actually i human being in the way the answers to the questions

200
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
Abbots itasca battery located to decide who is human

201
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
So this is a schematic diagram showing test suite in integrated sitting infront the terminal this is a valve

202
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
The world may contain ida human on computer and they together has to decide

203
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
Weather what is inside the computer or a human being

204
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
Now

205
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,887
Ace ventura kichak and not reliably distinguish

206
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679

Acumen answerer and the computer dancers

208
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
Then we can save the computer system

209
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,943
Artificial intelligence

210
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,295
This is a test device for children

211
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,903
To find out whether the machine has

212
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
Unable to come up with the right amount of intelligence to match human

213
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Answering questions

214
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
Now let's look at

215
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
Typical guy problems

216
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039

217
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
Task switcher mundane tasks that we do it another matter of fact in our daily life

218
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,791
There are some tasks that we consider intelligent

219
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,887
Like solving but the stupid mathematical problems

220
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
Playing games of chess in an expert fashion show an activity

221
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
Intelligent people can do well

222
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,063
Examples of mundane tasks are planning route

223
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,207
I want to go from here to the market and you plan apart along with you will go

224
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Are you want to go from here to let us a particular place in

225
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,495
Delhi and you have to plan your journey and plan your park

226
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Then

227
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Suppose

228
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991

Subway surfers tasks that we do routinely in fact post animals today's tasks routine

234
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
And then there expect us

235

00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:53,504
The current world chess champion carry kasparov

335
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
This is a computer deep blue

336
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,208
And this is tarah kasparov actress re after he lost the match

337
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
In machine translation

338
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,264
If you could have immediate translations between

339
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,152
Peoples speaking different languages that would be a remarkable feet and it has

340
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
Very white lens in economics

341
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
Cultural integration

342
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Double today

343
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,720
Tera people speaking so many different languages and we do not understand the languages of many other

344
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,632
As you know there are so many languages the modern xx

345
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
Official languages and their

346
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
I cannot understand the language of

347
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
So wouldn't it be nice if i we had a system which would do simultaneous machine brazil

348
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,552
So that we can definitely understand each other

349
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
Full machine translation

350
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,864
Is not yet there but where are you

351
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
They have been quite

352
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
Some progress in the field of machine translation

353
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
Small way for example the us military is giving a simpler one wait

354
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
Translation device

355
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
The using this in iraq

356
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:36,160
Just before suicide using the phrase letter to communicate with insured iraqi prisoners

357
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:41,280
Software for travellers cheque points and for other peace keeping cutie

358
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
University is working

359
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,704
System call the speech letter for

360
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,776
Used in talk to patient interview

361
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
Imagine how to recruit it is when a doctor does not understand the language of the patience to the patient and kind

362
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:03,040
Install the language of the doctor the patient will not be able to communicate his symptoms to the doctor

363
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,928
So that is being used in order to help doctors tools

364
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:15,328
In space exploration robotics space probes

365
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
Astronomer sleep monitor their surroundings

366
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Make decisions

367
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752

Mansarovar

374
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
So

375
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
We have a look at this page

376
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,544
Posted by jet propulsion laboratory

377
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
This page

378
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
Trustline

379
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,992
The exploration that have been started on

380
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
By the mars rover

381
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,392
Ketu mars rovers spirit and opportunity

382
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
That has been sent to

383
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,048
I have already finished the primary assignments

384
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,912
Are continuing with the exploratory duties

385
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,056
So bees to pages contain updates of spirits

386
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,896
And this page contains the update of opportunity

387
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Examples

388
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
Sex movies for you

389
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,856
Nx of some spirit update

390
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
Surat

391
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,744
Spirit spent the last few songs

392
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
Investigating for

393
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,168
Us cold including a successful crying to the rock abrasion to that is water actors

394
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,008
What is a rock abrasion tools robot spirit is doing

395
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,152
Is using her or compression tool and getting samples of rocks from the surface of mars

396
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,784
I'm trying to find out what chemicals are present in the rock

397
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
Objectives of this mission

398
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,952
Is to find out whether there is water in mars

399
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
X factor

400
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,584
Mars rovers have been able to trace the presence of water

401
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Rock sample singers

402
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,240
The opportunity is going from virginia to london

403
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,336
Two different locations to find on the bus service

404
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
And opportunities currently in

405
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,808
Critical endurance creator and to the breathing and examining rocks

406
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
This image shows the area inside endurance crater that opportunity has been exam

407
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Summoning

408
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,472
The roofer is investigating the distinct layers of rock that make up the srijan

409
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
I'm just image

410
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,200
Taken by robert highlights

411
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
The not used anna gets that covered the rock that has been named the pot of gold

412
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,464
Plants appear to stand up and up stock like features

413
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,816
Sources of the rock is dotted with fine scale pits

414
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
So many other news about

415
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Tiesto

416
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
Space rovers

417
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
The spirit rover this current exploring a range of motion hills that took 2 months to reach

418
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
It is finding curiously eroded rocks that maybe new pieces to the puzzle of the regents park

419
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,912
Spirits 2 in opportunity is also negotiating slope ground examining exposed rock

420
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,960
Players inside a creator

421
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
Informally maintain torrents

422
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
Puc

423
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,872
That we have intelligent agents

424
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
Starks are going to

425
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Unknown territory

426
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,088
Can human has been before and they are carrying on exploration

427
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
And making you and fences

428
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Internet

429
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,424
All of you are familiar with explosive growth of internet in recent years

430
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,776
And there is a growing interest in internet agents

431
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,592
Aajkal monitors uses task

432
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,920
Seek information that is needed

433
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
The web

434
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Ireland which information is most useful for particular user

435
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
Now that we have her looks at

436
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
Differences

437
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,960
Example systems that use artificial intelligence

438
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,800
Look at some approaches

439
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,176
Handsome approaches to solve signatures

440
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:31,232
One way of looking at a strong ios week

441
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,400
Song to build machines that can truly reason and solve problems

442
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
Machines that are self aware

443
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,336
Schools offer on intellectual ability

444
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,712
Is indistinguishable from that of a human being

445
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
So strong i proponents

446
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,416
Want to develop systems that are completely intelligent

447
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Dhadkan 2

448
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Thanks

449
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,584
Full name using the internet

00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,400
Substance can be human life

451
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,728
Can been on human life but sasha

452
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,968
When i was first conceived in the 1950 the 1960 there was a

453
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
Optimism about

454
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
And there was a prediction

455
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
That

456
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Very soon

457
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
Assistance to be able to

458
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Check

459
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,376
Humans and able to do everything that a human can do

460
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
And

461
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:47,776
Can do them much better and the tasks that humans cannot do within a short time

462
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
Optimism

463
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
Arsenal founded

464
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,016
And this was partly the reason why some people lost faith

465
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
In the techniques of ya

466
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
But

467
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
After

468
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
Research in tree house

469
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,864
Take a pic taken place for over 50 years

470
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
Now we are in a position

471
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,824
To understand and appreciate the true difficulty of the different problems that i face

472
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
And

473
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
You know what

474
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
Vitamin to solve

475
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Now

476
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
Hand watches motorcycles

479
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,232
Mera different techniques and different hardware

480
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
Different paradigms to be able stop

481
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,448
Which i unlike strong

482
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,264
Wpi tools with the creation

483
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,824
Artificial intelligence

484
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,224
That cannot truly reason unsolved problems but after 50 minutes

485
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,208
The proposals of vk i claim that

486
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,280
Machine setup in suitably programs

487
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816

Appear to be behave intelligency appear to be to task

490
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
Well and intelligence e

491
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
Without having the same

492
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,688
Intelligence understanding as humans possess

493
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,928
So strong and i really deals with machines that really have

494
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
Mental states that increase and understand the behaviour

495
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,096
Why is involved in

496
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
Simulating you

497
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,704
Human behaviour of simulating intelligent behaviour

498
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:58,080
Claiming that the reasoning process behind it is intelligent

499
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,736
Apply toward the goal of the plant is to produce

500
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Commercially viable smart systems

501

Examples

531
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,232
One may have a theory about how humans recognise faces

532
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
You know how we recognise faces of recognise faces how is store all the different way

533
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,008
Cases are some of the many different faces that we have seen in a lifetime and how we

00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
And the scores

565
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,280
Also we are going to study some of this topic

566
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Most of this topic

567
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:47,456

That can work intelligency in any domain

574
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
We need to have a lot of things

575
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
For example

576
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
Such a system must have come
