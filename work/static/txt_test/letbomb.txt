LETTER BOMBS ARE VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE, BUT THE DIFFICULT PART IS MAKING
SURE IT WILL DETONATE PROPERLY, OR THAT IT IS NOT OBVIOUS THAT IT IS A
BOMB.

MIXTURES:
ABOUT 75% ALUMINUM POWDER WITH 25%
IRON POWER IS BEST.
THIS IS A LIGHT VERSION OF THERMITE, SINCE IT IS IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE (THE
ENVELOPE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW A WAYS). MIX THE ABOVE WELL.  THE IDEA IS
THIS:  IRON CAN BURN, AT A VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE, BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE
HELP.  THIS IS WHAT THE ALUMINUM IS FOR.  ALUMINUM BURNS AT A RELATIVELY
LOW TEMPERATURE, SO IT IS USED AS A CATALYST OF SORTS.  MAGNESIUM IS USED
TO FLASH-IGNITE THE ALUMINUM, WHICH THEN BURNS THE IRON, AT A SUITABLE
TEMPERATURE.  SINCE THIS IS GOING OFF IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE, IT WILL BURN
MUCH HOTTER AND SLOWER AND WITH MORE VIOLENCE THAN A NORMAL MIX. I ADVISE
YOU PLAY WITH THIS FOR A WHILE, LEARNING YOUR MIXTURE.

NOW FOR THE FUN STUFF:
GET AN INSULATED (PADDED) ENVELOPE, THE TYPE THAT IS DOUBLE LAYERED.
SEPERATE THE LAYERS.  IN THE INNER LAYER GOES THE WONDERFUL MIXTURE, ONE
YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH.  KEEP THIS SECTION SEPERATE, BUT IT MIGHT BE
HANDLE TO TOP IT OFF WITH SOME MAGNESIUM.  THE OUTER LAYER CAN BE EITHER
MAGNESIUM, FOR A FLASH BOMB, OR POSSIBLY A MATERIAL OF YOUR OWN CHOICE.
NOW FOR THE DIFFICULT PART! THE FUSE...   WE CAN MAKE A FUSE FROM ANOTHER
SET OF CHEMICALS: IODINE CRYSTALS, AND AMONIUM HYDROXIDE, IN LIQUID FORM.
MIX THESE TOGETHER, IN ABOUT AND EQUAL AMOUNT, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A
HEAVY AMOUNT OF IODINE IF PRESSED FOR TIME.  THESE FORM A NEW CRYSTALLINE
STRUCTURE, ABOUT AND INCH LONG.  THESE ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE, AND I ADVISE
KEEPING THEM PROTECTED.  THEY HAVE ABOUT THE IMPACT POWER OF AN M-100 FOR
A TEASPOON. I PUT THESE IN A PROTECTIVE CARD-BOARD LINING, AND PUT THEM AT
THE TOP OF THE ENVELOPE.  RIG THIS SO IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE CRYTALS WHEN
THE PACKAGE IS OPENED, BUT NOT FROM JUST SQUEEZING THE ENVELOPE.  THIS IS
TRICKY, AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT HERE. SEAL THIS UP, AND YOU HAVE A WORKING
LETTER BOMB. BY THE WAY, SINCE THE BULK OF LETTER BOMBS ARE EASILY
RECOGNIZABLE, THEY RARELY MAKE IT PAST THE POST OFFICE.

*****
I FROWN UPON THE USE OF LETTER BOMBS AS A MEANS OF GETTING EVEN BECAUSE
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IT IS GOING TO DETONATE AROUND, OR THAT IT WILL EVEN BE
THEM.  THERE ARE SIMPLER WAYS OF GETTING EVEN, SO TAKE ONE OF THEM. IT IS
ALSO A FEDERAL OFFENCE TO MAKE AND SEND ONE.  PROCEDE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
***** HOW TO AVOID LETTER BOMBS: SINCE YOU MADE IT THIS FAR INTO THE FILE,
I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO AVOID BEING DETONATED WITH A LETTER BOMB YOU MAY
HAVE HAD SENT TO YOU.

1)  NEVER OPEN A LETTER BOMB THE WAY IT WANTS TO BE OPENED!  THIS IS THE
WAY OF POSSIBLY AVOIDING THE FUSE.  IF IT IS SET TO DETONATE ON CONTACT
WITH AIR, THEN THIS WILL NOT WORK.
2)  DON'T SQUEEZE, BEND, OR ANYTHING!
3)  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BOMB, THEN DON'T EVEN TOUCH IT!  THIS IS THE BEST
WAY TO AVOID PROBLEMS!
