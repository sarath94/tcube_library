Light Bulb Bomb

Ingredients:

   * light bulb, socket, switch etc.

   * M80, or CO2 bomb

   * duct tape

   * paper bag

   * something that is gross, to put in the bag

How to do it:

   * Go to a place where your victim is going to have to turn on a light.
     Note: Make sure the light is OFF when you do this.

   * Unscrew the bulb and break it, with out destroying the filiment. This
     may take several bulbs to get right.

   * Screw the bulb back in.

   * Put whatever substance you decided to use in the bag. Suggestions for
     substance in the bag: shit, rotten food, dead animals, dust, bottle of
     cheap perfume.

   * Place the M80 or CO2 bomb in the bag, well surrounded by what is in
     the bag.

   * Touch the fuse to the filiment, and tape the bag in place.

When the light is turned on, the filiment will heat the fuse very fast, and
the bomb will explode, spraying whatever was in the bag all over the place.
