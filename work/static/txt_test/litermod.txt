        Here is a simple way to make a flame thrower well, sort of. Once    
        the lighter is modofied it can spit out a twelve inch flame, and 
        scare the hell out of whoever lighting the damn thing. Here is 
        what you do.  
 
 
                1. Buy an ajustable lighter [preferably a Scripto ]  
                and pry off the metal thingie on top. 
 
                2.Move the black flame ajuster thing to low flame and  
                slide it to high flame.    
                 
                3.Now push up on the little black ring so it comes off  
                of the little gear that controls the gas release.  
 
                4.Making sure that you do not move the gear that controls  
                the gas release back, move the black ring back to the  
                low flame position then push the ring back on to the gear  
                and move it to the high flame position. 
 
                5.Now repeat steps 3 and 4 a few times. [the more  
                times that you do it the higher the flame will be, also ,  
                if you open it to the point that gas is leaking you will  
                need to light it with a match.]
