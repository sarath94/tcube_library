THIS IS THE FIFTH OF THE NINJA009 SERIES.  I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE FIRST
FOUR BULLETINS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE AS WELL...
 
***WARNING***
THERE IS A HEAVILY ENFORCED LAW ON BREAKING AND ENTRY.  IF YOU GET CAUGHT FOR
B&E, AND YOU ARE OVER 18, YOU WILL DEFINITELY GO TO * JAIL *...
IF YOU ARE UNDER AGED...STILL DON'T DO IT, SOME TIMES THE STUFF YOU DO STAYS
ON YOUR FUTURE RECORDS.
 
BACKGROUND:
-----------
NINJA'S WERE ABLE TO WALK THRU WALLS, ENTER AND LEAVE A ROOM WITHOUT A TRACE.
THIS WAS ONE OF THE STEALTH SKILLS, THAT THE NINJA'S POSSESSED.  THERE WERE
RUMORS THAT NINJAS CAN VANISH INTO A WALL...WELL...THAT'S A LITTLE HOAX.
YES WE ARE ABLE TO ENTER AND EXIT A ROOM WITHOUT A LARGE TRACE...IF YOU KNOW
HOW JAPANESE HOUSES IN THE ANCIENT TIMES WERE BUILT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE
SUPPORT POSTS, THEY USUALLY HAVE GRAPPLING HOOK MARKS IF A NINJA HAD WALKED
THRU THE ROOM TO KILL A PERSON OR SOMETHING.  BUT ONE HAS TO LOOK VERY, VERY
CAREFULLY.
 
--------------
HOW TO DO ITS:
--------------
WELL...I WON'T GET INTO ANY PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT OR THE ANCIENT STUFF.
I'LL GIVE YOU INFO ON THE STUFF YOU CAN PUT TO MODERN USE.
 
HOW TO PICK FILE CABINET LOCKS:
-------------------------------
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE TO PICK OPEN A FILE CABINET.  MOST FILE CABINETS NOWADAYS
HAVE A CHEAP DISK TUMBLING SYSTEM.  IF THE DISK PATTERNS MATCH THE KEY SHAPE,
PRESTO!  IT'S OPEN.
 
LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT DISK TUMBLERS ARE...
 
 
          I  I  I  I  I             ****
          I     I  I        ** * ****** *    -----  KEY
                           ************ *
          I  I  I  I  I             ****
 
          ^  ^  ^  ^  ^
          |--|--|--|--|
          EACH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE (^) ARROWS ARE POINTING TO ARE
          DISKS.  ( SORRY FOR THE BAD ILLUSTRATIONS. )
 
          IF THE KEY INSERTED THRU THE 5 DISKS, AND THE PATTERN OF THE DISKS
          MATCH, IT OPENS.
 
SO TO MAKE A KEY THAT WORKS WITH MOST (ALL) CABINET LOCKS...
 
GET A WIRE FAIRLY THICK, JUST THIS ENOUGH TO FIT THRU THE LOCKS.
BEND IT IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION.
 
                                +---- THE DISTANCE    SHOULD EQUAL
    ----------/\/\/\-           v     FROM TOP OF     THE DISTANCE   /\
                               /      THE HUMP TO     ACROSS TWO
                              ^       THE BOTTOM OF   TOPS OR       ^  ^
                              +------ THE HUMP        BOTTOMS  -----|--|
 
WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR KEY, JUST INSERT IT ALL THE WAY IN.  JERK IT UP AND DOWN
AS FAST AS YOU CAN, AS YOU TURN THE KEY TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT, DEPENDING ON
HOW THE LOCK OPENS.  IF YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN
ANY FILE CABINET LOCK IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  I USUALLY TAKE ABOUT 3 TO 5
SECONDS WITH MY KEY.
 
 
OPENING LOCKED DOORS:
---------------------
I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN TEACHING HOW TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS.  I'LL TELL YOU
THE MOST BASIC WAY OF DOING IT.  THIS TECHNIQUE HAS TO BE A DOOR WITH A GAP
AS WIDE AS A WIDTH OF A BUTTER KNIFE.
 
IF YOU HAVE A BUTTER KNIFE OR A BUTTER FLY KNIFE OR EQUIVALENT, HANDY, YOU CAN
OPEN THESE KINDA DOORS AS THOUGH YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THEM.
 
           DOOR GAP

             | |---- THE SO CALLED "BOLT" OF THE DOOR.

      BIRD'S EYE AND ENLARGED VIEW OF THIS
 
 
 
              |----------  THE KNIFE
              v
              I            ---- SLIDE THE KNIFE THIS WAY FOR THIS PICTURE
         ____ I   ______
             |I _|
             |I/ |         DOOR
             |/  |
             |___|
         ____|   |_______
               ^
               |--------------- THE "BOLT"
 
 
IF THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACES YOU THEN WITH THE KNIFE, PUSH ON THE
BOLT WITH THE BACK OF THE BLADE.  AS YOU PUSH, SLIDE THE KNIFE TOWARDS THE
SIDE OF THE DOOR. (SEE ILLUSTATION FOR CLARITY).  YOU WILL SLOWLY MOVE IT.
AND PRESTO!  THE DOOR IS OPEN.  THE TRICK IS TO SLIDE THE KNIFE AND PUSHING
IT AT THE SAME TIME, AND HOLD ON TO THE DOOR KNOB. IF IT OPENS INWARDS, GET
READY TO PUSH IT AS SOON AS THE KNIFE IS THRU THE "BOLT".
 
FOR THE OTHER CASE ( THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACING AWAY FROM YOU ),
YOU JUST PULL ON THE KNIFE AND GIVE THE SAME SLIDING MOTION.  BE CAREFUL
NOT TO STAB YOURSELF.  THE KNIFE'S CONTACT POINT IS ALWAYS THE BACK OF THE
KNIFE.
 
 
 
SINCE I HAVE A LIMIT TO THE LENGTH OF MY FILES, I WILL PUT PART 2 OF THIS ON
THE NEXT ISSUE OF THE NINJA 009 SERIES.
