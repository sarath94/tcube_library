  THIS TUTORIAL WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO "PICK" A PIN TUMBLER LOCK.  USE OF THIS
MATERIAL IS FOR LOCKSMITHS ONLY, ANY USE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR ILLEGAL
PURPOSES IS FORBIDDEN AMt@AGAINST THE LAW.  (AS LONG AS WE ARE AT IT, DO YOU
WANT TO BUY SOME LAND IN FLORIDA?)

  IN ORDER TO PICK A PIN TUMBLER LOCK, YOU WILL REQUIRE FOUR ITEMS:  A LOCK,
YOU, A PICK, AND A TENSION WRENCH.  YOU CAN USSUALLY GET THESE AT A LOCKSMITH
STORE, IF YOU CAN NOT FIND ONE NEAR YOU THERE WILL BE AN ADDRESS AT THE END OF
THE ARTICLE THAT YOU CAN ORDER THEM FROM.  HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF A PICK
AND A TENSION WRENCH:


         ________/  !________
      PICK    TENSION WRENCH

  MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THE NEED FOR THE PICK, BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE WRENCH
IS FOR.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WITH- OUT IT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSCE TO PICK A
LOCK.

  IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK, WE COUNT UPON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE LOCK. BEFORE
WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACTUALLY PICK THE LOCK, WE WIFPLOOK AT THE PARTS OF IT AND
HOW THE IMPERFECTION PART FITS IN.  HERE IS A DISSASSEMBLED LOCK:

   !  !__   _   _
   !     \__  / \_/ \__
   !        \/   
    \__/-------------------  <- KEY


  WHEN YOU INSERT A KEY INTO A LOCK, THE BOTTOM OF THE PLUG IS PUSHED UP, AND
IF IT IS THE PROPER KEY, THE TOPS OF THE BOTTOM PINS WILL MATCH WITH THE SPOT
WHERE THE PLUG AND HOUSING MEET, THUS UMTWING YOU TO TURN THE PLUG, AND OPEN
THE DOOR, ETC..  WHEN YOU a#ER THE KEY, THE BOTTOM PINS GO INTO THE VALLEYS OF
THE KEY, THUS MEANING THAT THE KEY MUST HAVE THE RIGHT HEIGHT VALLEYS TO MAKE
THE LOCK OPEN. PRETTY ELEMENTRY, RIGHT?  WELL NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO HOW TO
PICK A LOCK.

  IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK WE (AS I SAID BEFORE) DEPEND ON THE INACCURACY OF THE
MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE FIRST THHLG TO DO IS TO INSERT THE TENSION WRENCH
INTO THE LOCK AND APPLY A SLIGHT PRESSURE TO THE LEFT (OR RIGHT IF YOU WISH) SO
THAT IF YOU COULD LOOK INSIDE THE LOCK AT WHERE THE PLUG AND THE HOUSING WOULD
MEET, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

        ! !*! !
     HOUSING   ! !*! !
        ! !*! !
     __________! !*! !___________
     __________  !*! ____________
       !  !*!!
     PLUG     !  !_!!
       !   _ !
       !  !*!!
       !  \_/!

  NOW A SLIGHT PRESURE IS ON THE PINS. BECAUSE THE PINS CAN NOT BE PRODUCED
EXACTLY THE SAME, THERE IS ONE PIN WHICH IS THE WIDEST AND THERE FORE HAS MORE
TENSION ON IT, AND ONE WHICH IS THE THINNEST AND HAS ALMOST NO PRESSURE ON IT.
WE NOW USE THE PICK TO >GENTLY< PUSH EACH PIN UP (AND TRY TO FEEL IT WHEN YOU
LET IT DOWN) UNTIL WE FIND WHICH IS THE TIGHTEST ON AND WHICH IS LOOSEST.
GETTING THE FEEL FOR THIS IS THE HARDEST PART OF LOCK PICKING. NOW THAT YOU
HAVE FOUND THE LOOSEST ONE, GENTLY PRESS IT UPWARD UNTIL YOU FEEL A SLIGHT
REDUCTION IN TENSION ON THE TENSION WRENCH.  THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE TOP OF
THE BOTTOM PIN BECOMES EVEN WITH THE JUNCTION OF THE PLUG AND

  THE HOUSING. DO NOT RELEASE ANY TENSION FROM THE WRENCH NOW!  THE DRIVER
WILL NOW BE TRAPPED IN THE HOUSING AS ILLUSTRATED HERE:  (DON'T I DRAW PRETTY)

     ! !*! !
   HOUSING  ! !*! !
     ! !*! !
 ___________! !_! !___________
 _______________     ___________
        ! !*! !
    PLUG       ! !*! !
        ! \_/ !
        !     !

  NOW YOU CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WITH EACH OF THE PINS UNTIL YOU WORK YOUR WAY
UP TO THE ONE THAT IS WIDEST.  WITH SOME PRACTICE YOU CAN GET FAIRLY FAST AT
THIS.  I SUGGEST PRACTICING ON A FOUR PIN TUMBLER LOCK THAT IS BOUGHT FROM A
HARDWARE STORE, THE CHEAPER THE BETTER.

  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS A PATICULAR CONFIGURATION OF THE PINS NOW THAT MAY
PRESENT A PARTICULARLY HARD JOB TO PICK.  THIS IS GRAPHICLY SHOWN HERE BY THE
TWO MIDDLE PINS:

 !*! !*! !*! !*!
 !*! !*! !_! !*!
 !*! !*!  _  !*!
 !_! !*! !*! !_!
  _  !*! !*!  _
 !*! !*! !*! !*!
 !*! !_! !*! !*!
 !*!  _ !*! !*!
 !*! !*! !*! !*!
 \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/

      \_______________

  WHEN YOU TRY TO PUSH THE 2ND PIN FROM THE LEFT UP, YOU WILL UNAVOIDABLY BE
PUSHING THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT UP BE- CAUSE OF IT'S LONG BOTTOM PIN.  THE ONLY
SOLUTION FOR THIS IS TO GET A SPECIAL PICK THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:

  
   \   _______________
    \_/

  THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT IT IS HARD TO INITIALLY DETECT.  THE
REASON THAT IT MAKES IT HARDER IF IT IS NOT IMMEDIETLY APPERANT IS THAT YOU UN-
AVOIDABLY PUSH THE 3RD PIN FROM THE LEFT UP INTO THE HOUSING, GETTING IT
JAMMED:

      ! !*! !
   HOUSING   ! !_! !
      ! _  !
      ! !*! !
   __________! !*! !________
   ___________ !*! ________
       !!*!!
     PLUG     !!*!!
       !\_/!


  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A TECHNIQUE CALLED RAKING.  IT USES A TOOL LIKE
THIS:

 \/\/\/|______________
  BASICLY YOU "RAKE" IT K AND FORTH ACROSS THE PINS, HOPING THAT COMBINED WITH
THE TENSION IT WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT COMBINATION.  THIS WAY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO
WORK FAST AT TIMES, BUT IS NOT VERY RELIABLE, AND I WOULD SUGGEST LEARNING TO
ACTUALLY "PICK" THE LOCK.

  EARLIER I PROMISED AN ADDRESS TO ORDER LOCKSMITHING MATERIALS FROM, SO HERE
IT IS:

 GARRISON PROTECTIVE ELECTRONICS

 KEW GARDENS, NEW YORK, 11415

  SOURCES:  PERSONAL PRACTICE AND MANY EXCELLENT BOOKS FROM MENTOR PRESS, IF
YOU WOULD LIKE THEIR CATALOG, SEND A SASE TO:

      How to Pick Master Locks
      By Gin Fizz & Ninja NYC

    Have you ever tried to impress your friends by picking one of those Master
combination locks and failed? Well then read on. The Master lock company has
made this kind of lock with a protection scheme. If you pull the handle of it
hard, the knob won't turn. That was their biggest mistake...... Ok, now on to
it.

  1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on.  1:
The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination), pull
on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move.  2:  While pulling on it turn
the knob to the left until it won't move any more.  Then add 5 to this number.
Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.

  2nd number.  (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times, then
go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st
number once.  WHEN you have bypassed.  Start pulling the handle and turning it.
It will eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the groove pull on
it and turn the knob.  If it is loose go to the next groove; if it's stiff you
got the second number.

    3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers,
then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on it. The lock
will eventually open if you did it right. If can't do it the first time, be
patient, it takes time.

 Have phun...

BY NIGHTWING

  SO YOU WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL.  WELL, IF YOU ARE WANTING TO BE LIKE JAMES BOND
AND OPEN A LOCK IN FIFTEEN SECONDS, GO TO HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
PLACE YOUR GONNA DO IT.  EVEN EXPERIENC ED LOCKSMITHS CAN SPEND 5 TO 10 MINUTES
ON A LOCK IF THEY'RE UNLUCKY.  IF YOU A RE LOOKING FOR EXTREMELY QUICK ACCESS,
LOOK ELSEWHERE.  THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTA IN MOSTLY TO THE
"LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE LOCK, SINCE IT IS THE EASIEST TO PICK.  IF THERE IS
SUFFICIENT DEMAND, I WILL LATER WRITE A FILE DISCUSSING THE OTHE R FORMS OF
ENTRANCE, INCLUDING DEAD-BOLT

  FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET.  IF Y OU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE
YOU A SET.  THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE. IF YOU FIND A
LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON 'T GIVE UP HOPE.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
YOUR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A GRIN DER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT IT TAKES
FOREVER.)

  THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH S ET (VERY SMALL).  THESE SHOULD BE
SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT INTO THE KEYHOLE SLOT.  N OW, BEND THE LONG END OF THE
ALLEN WRENCH AT A SLIGHT ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.  ) IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE
THIS:

  #1
       \
   \\\   (THIS IS THE HANDLE
      \\  THAT WAS ALREADY
      \\  (HERE.)
      \
      \
      \

  NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A F ILE AND SMOOTH THE END (#1) UNTIL
IT'S ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HANG INSIDE THE LO CK.  TEd%@%@saHa'!RTT0' 2A rAP0@Nd|KB

TO THE FRONT, AND WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH....  .  THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE
SCREWDRIVER WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN.  DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON
YOUR FIR ST TRY!  IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT 20-30 MINUTES YOUR FIRST
TIME.  AFTER T HAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE.
