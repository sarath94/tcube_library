          ]]  LOCK  PICKING  [[

So you want to be a criminal.  Well, if you're wanting to be like James Bond
and open a lock in fifteen seconds, go to Hollywood because that's the only
place you're gonna do it.  Even experienced locksmiths can spend 5 to 10
minutes on a lock if they're unlucky.  If you are looking for extremely quick
access, look elsewhere.

The following instructions will pertain mostly to the "lock-in-knob" type
lock, since it is the easiest to pick.  If there is sufficient demand, I will
later write a file discussing the other forms of entrance, including
dead-bolts.

First of all, you need a pick set.  If you know a locksmith, get him to make
you a set.  This will be the best possible set for you to use.  If you can't
find a locksmith willing to supply a set, don't give up hope.  It is possible
to make your own, if you have access to a grinder -- you can use a file, but
it takes forever.  Even better would be to take a mail-order locksmith course
-- at the end of one you can legally buy key blanks and so forth, and can even
go into business for yourself!  But those cost a lot of money, and most people
don't need to go to all the trouble.

The first thing you need to make your own is an allen wrench set (very small).
These should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot.  Now, bend the long
end of the allen wrench at a slight angle..(not 90 deg.)  It should look
something like this:

  #1
       \\
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\       (This is the handle that
                                           \\\       was already here.)
                                           \\\
                                           \\\
                                           \\\
                                           \\\

Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file and smooth the end (#1) until it's
rounded so it won't hang inside the lock.  Test your tool out on doorknobs at
your house to see if it will slide in and out smoothly.

Now this is where the screwdriver comes in.  Is it small enough for it and
your pick to be used in the same lock at the same time, one above the other?
Let's hope so, because that's the only way you're gonna open it.

In the coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the interior of a
lock:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX| K
 #  #  #  #   #   #    | E
    #     #   #   #    | Y
 *     *               | H
 *  *  *  *   *   *    | O
                       | L
                       | E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|

#= upper tumbler pin
*= lower tumbler pin
X= cylinder wall

(This is a greatly simplified drawing)

The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the upper pin and
the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall.  Now, if you push a pin up, its
tendency is to fall back down, right?  That's where the screwdriver comes in.
Insert the screwdriver into the slot and turn.  This tension will keep the
"solved" pins from falling back down.  Now, work from the back of the lock to
the front, and when you're through.....

There will be a click, the screwdriver will turn freely, and the door will
open.  Don't get discouraged on your first try!  It will probably take you
about 20-30 minutes your first time.  After that you will quickly improve with
practice.

This is by no means the most efficient way of entering a house.  If you would
like another item or two devoted to these other ways, let the sysop know.
