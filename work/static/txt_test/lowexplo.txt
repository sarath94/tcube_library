How To Make Low Explosives
--------------------------

        Up to this point, I have referred only to high explosives, but there
are many formulas for low explosives, which, although they do not have the
power or impact of the high explosives, are generally speaking safer to use
and handle. It may seem at first that an explosive compound that has less
power is a disadvantage, but this is not true. If a high-explosive charge were
used to set off a bullet in a gun, the gun would probably explode in the
user's face. Therefore, low explosives have a definite purpose and use, and 
are not interchangeable with high explosives. Although I stated above that,
generally speaking, low explosives are more stable than high explosives, there
are some low-explosive compounds that are as dangerous as high-explosive
compounds, if not more so. Below is a chart of the most common low-explosive
compounds and their stabilities and merit.

[Potassium and sodium nitrate gunpowders]: These are without a doubt one of
        the safest low explosives to handle. They are especially good when 
        packed into a tight container, and exploded under pressure.
[Smokeless powder]: This type of low explosive is much like the one mentioned
        above, in the sense that it is extremely stable, but it is much more
        powerful. It also needs the element of pressure in the actual
        demolition work.
[Potassium chlorates with sulfates]: Any mixture of potassium or sodium
        chlorates should be avoided at all costs, since most combinations will
        explode immediately, on formation, and those that don't are extremely
        unstable and likely to explode at any time.
[Ammonium nitrate with chlorates]: This is similar to the compounds discussed
        above. These are extremely hazardous compounds, with very unstable
        ingredients.
[Potassium chlorate and red phosphorus]: This combination is probably the
        most unstable and highly sensitive of all the low explosives. It will
        explode immediately and violently upon formation, even in the open
        when not under pressure.
[Aluminum or megnesium with potassium chlorate or sodium peroxide]: Any of
        these combinations, although not quite as unstable as the one
        discussed above, is still too sensitive to experiment or play around
        with.
[Barium chlorate with shellac gums]: Any mixture employing either barium or
        barium nitrate and carbon, or barium chlorate and any other substance,
        must be given great care. Barium nitrate and strontium nitrate mixed
        together form a very sensitive explosive, but the danger is greatly
        increased with the addition of charcoal, or carbon.
[Barium and strontium nitrate with aluminum and potassium perchlorate]: This
        combination is relatively safe, as is the combination of barium
        nitrate and sulfur, potassium nitrate, and most other powdered metals.
[Guanidine nitrate and a combustible]: This combination of guanidine nitrate
        and a combustible (i.e. powdered antimony) is one of the safest of all
        low explosives.
[Potassium bichromate and potassium permanganate]: This is a very sensitive
        and unstable compound, and should be avoided, as it is really too
        hazardous to work with or handle.

        The low-explosive reaction is based on the principle of a combustible
material combined with an oxidizing agent, in other words combining a material
that burns easily with another material which in the chemical reaction will
supply the necessary oxygen for the combustible's consumption. Listed below
are the most common low-explosive combinations of oxidizing agents and
combustibles. The first ingredient listed is the oxidizer, and the second is
the combustible:
        [1> Nitric acid and resin.
        [2> Barium nitrate and magnesium.
        [3> Ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum.
        [4> Barium peroxide and zinc dust.
        [5> Ammonium perchlorate and asphaltum.
        [6> Sodium chlorate and shellac gum.
        [7> Potassium nitrate and charcoal.
        [8> Sodium peroxide and flowers of sulfur.
        [9> Magnesium perchlorate and woodmeal.
       [10> Potassium perchlorate and cane sugar.
       [11> Sodium nitrate and sulfur flour.
       [12> Potassium bichromate and antimony sulfide.
       [13> Guanidine nitrate and powdered antimony.
       [14> Potassium chlorate and red phosphorus.
       [15> Potassium permanganate and powdered sugar.
       [16> Barium chlorate and parrafin wax.

        The combinations that are most unstable and sensitive are numbers 3,
5, 7, 13, 14, 15, and 16. These should be avoided.
