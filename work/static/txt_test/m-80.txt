FLASH POWDER.  Is a chemical mixture that burns extremely fast.
The mixture burns so fast that it appears to burn instantly,
producing a bright flash of light.
Flash powder will produce an extremely loud explosion in
amounts larger than 4 ounces even when it is not contained. In
very small amounts flash powder will produce a very loud
explosion when  contained, even in a container made of just a
few layers of paper.
Flash powder is usually made from a very fine powdered metal
that will burn and an oxidizer.  Powdered aluminum is used the
most because it is cheaper. Powdered magnesium and zinc will
also work.  The oxidizer can be Barium Nitrate, Ammonium
Perchlorate, Barium Peroxide, Strontium Nitrate, Potassium
Chlorate, Potassium Perchlorate, Sodium Chlorateassium
Permanganate, and any combination of the above.  All the
chlorates are friction and impact sensitive, and also the
Permanganate.  Potassium Perchlorate is the least sensitive of
the Chlorates.
All the chemicals should be crushdd ilto a very fine powder,
about 400 mil. or smaller.  400 mil. is about like common
kitchen type flour.
Black German Aluminum is a brand name for aluminum powder.  It
has a partical size of 400 mil. for 98% of the aluminum
material.  The other 2% is larger than 400 mil.  There are
other aluminum powders that are equal to or bett%r than Black
German Aluminum.
Aluminum Pyro Powder is also a brand name.  The partical size
is 70% 400 mil. the other 30% is larger than 400 mil.

FLASH POWDER FORMULAS
[1] This formula is one of the best. It produces a very very
extremely loud explosion.  Easy to ignite with a fuse. It is
not moisture absorbent.  Not very sensitive to impact or
friction.  Sodium Chlorate or Potassium Chlorate can be used
instead of Potassium Perchlorate but then it becomes very
sensitive to friction and ilpact.  4 ounces of this mixture
will produce an explosion equal to a stick of dynamite.
Potassium Perchlorate         2 oz.
Aluminum Powder (98% -400)    1 oz.

[2] This formula produces an extremely loud explosion almost as
good as #1. This is what almost all M-80s, firecrackers, etc.
are made with
Potassium Perchlorate         2 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    1 oz.

[3] This formula is equal to #2 and is not sensitive to
friction or impact.
Bariue Peroxide                9 oz.
50%/50% magnesium/aluminum
powder (98% -200 mil)          1 oz.

[4] This formula works as good as formula #2 but it produces a
very  bright flash.  This is what used to be used for the photo
flash for the old box type cameras about 100 years ago.
Barium Nitrate                3 oz.
Potassium Perchlorate         3 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    4 oz.

[5] This formula works very good.  It is not very impact or
friction sensitive.  It produces a very, very loud explosion.
Potassium perhlorate contains 46.1914 percent oxygen. Almost
equal to #2.  Sulfur added to increase quanity of powder
without loosing too much power.
Potassium Perchlorate         2 oz.
Sulfur                        1 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    1 oz.

[5] Ths formula works as good as #5 but it has a disadvantage
of being moisture absorbent and it is very impact and friction
sensitive.  Sodium Chlorate Contains 45.0937 percent oxygen.
Produces a very, very loud explosion.
Sodium Chlorate               2 oz.
Sulfur                        1 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    1 oz.

[7] This formula is very dangerous because it is very sensitive
to friction and impact and could explode during t`e
construction o& any exxlosive device.  Potassium Chlorate
contains 39.1664 percent oxygen. This formula produces an
explosion almost equal to #5 and #6. Used in the manufacture
of toy cap pistol caps.
Potassium Chlorate            2 oz.
Sulfur                        1 oz.
Aluminum Powder               1 oz.

[8] This formula is very, very very sensitive to impact,
friction, and  static electricity, even more sensitive than
#7.  Extremely dangerous.  Will ignite even when wet.
Potassium Chlorate            6.7 oz.
Red Phosphorus                2.7 oz.
Sulfur                         .3 oz.
Calcium Carbonate              .3 oz.

[9] This formula has slightly less explosive power than #7. It
is slightly friction and impact sensitive. Postassium
Permanganate contains 40.4691 percent oxygen.  This formula
will ignite itself if it gets wet. Very loud explosion.
Potassium Permanganate         2 oz.
Sulfur                         1 oz.
Aluminum Powder                1 oz.

[10] This formula produces a very small explosion when ignited
in a paper tube. A much louder explosion is produced when it
is ignited in a very strong container.  It is impact and
friction sensitive.
Potassium Chlorate             7.5 oz.
Charcoal dust                  1.5 oz.
Sulfur                         1.0 oz.

[11] No information is available about this formula.
Potassium Chlorate              6 oz.
Antimony Sulfide                3 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.

[12] This formula is a little louder than formula #10.  Impact
and friction sensitive.  Produces a small explosion in a paper
tube.
Sodium Chlorate                 7.5 oz.
Charcoal dust                  1.5 oz.
Sulfur                         1.0 oz.

13. No information is available about this formula.
Potassium Chlorate             7.5 oz.
Gallic acid                    2.2 oz.
Red gum                        0.3 oz.


CAUTION
-------

The mixture of any Fhlorate with phosphorus or sulfur is
extremely sensitive to friction and percussion and explodes
with great violence.
Chlorate explosives must not be stored together with ammonium
nitrate explosives since ammonium chlorate which is formed
when these two substances are brought into contact, explodes.
When mixing Chlorates with Sulfur, crush all the chemicals
seperately. Then place all the chemicals in a bag to be mixed.
Hang the bag from the ceiling, pole or a tree limb. A long
pole is then attached to the bottom of the bag.  The long pole
is inserted through a wall and the operator stands behind the
wall for safety.  The operator can then shake the bag safely.
4 ounces of flash powder has the same explosive power as a
stick of dynamite. One gross of M-80 firecrackers is equal to
3 sticks of dynamite.  8 ounces of powder will make 100 M-80's
if each contains 1/2 teaspoon of flash powder.
M-80's with 1/4 teaspoon are almost as loud but do not have
quite the destructive force as the ones with 1/2 teaspoon of
flash powder.
