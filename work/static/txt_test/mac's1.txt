	Well here we go, my first volume of MacGyver's Anarchy. In this volume I will go into a basic inceiary fuse and igniter. 

I. String Fuse
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
	This is a really easy to make fuse for igniting incendiaries. 

Materials needed-
	string or shoelaces made of cotton or linen. 
	Potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
	granulated sugar
	hot plate, or stove
	cooking container, large beaker
	spoon
	
Preparation-
	(1)     Make sure the shoelaces or string is clean. If they are dirty just      wash them.
	(2)     Dissolve one part potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate and   one part granulated sugar in twoarts warm water.
	(If you are using fertilizer grade potassium nitrate, make sure it is at        least 40% potassium nitra, if possible use a nonmetallic spoon, and     try not to use a bunsen burner.)        
	(3)     Soak the string or shoelace in the solution for at least five   minutes and then        remove from thwarm water.
	(4)     Hang the fuse to dry.
	
		Now you have a fuse.
	Now to ignite an igniter with the fuse simply insert the dry fuse in some igniter. Make sure the fu can't move around when placed in the igniter. Just ignite the free end and watch it go, unless youae igniting some high explosives or a large amount of incendiaries.


II. Sugar-Chlorate
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
	This is another easy to make incendiary which is somewhat powerful.
Again we are using potassium chlorate. In later issues you will learn some of the better things you n do with potassium chlorate. But for now here's the sugar-chlorate formula.

Materials needed-
	Granulated sugar(don't' use powdered sugar)
	Potassium chlorate
	Nonmetallic spoon. 
	Mortar and pestle (not really necessary)
	jar with tight lid
	
Preparation-
	(1)     Using a clean spoon and measure equal amounts of Potassium      chlorate and granulated sugar.          
	(2)     If the Potassium chlorate has lumps or is not consistent in     texture use the mortar and pestle  even out the roughness. 

	This  mixture is most effective in powder rather than crystalline form. It can be initiated by the ring fuse,  pile of match heads, magnesium ribbon or even  drops of sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid an agnesium ribbon is usually inconvenient. This mixture can be stored in a tightly sealed jar for a ewmonths. 


	In MacGyver's Anarchy Vol.2 I will cover Black powder, smokescreens and Astrolite G(the strongest nnuclear explosive known to man).
