	III. Black Powder
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````  Black powder also known as gunpowder, is an important low power explosive. Here r11 safe methods of preparing gunpowder.

** The most common formula of gunpowder because the materials are widely availiable to everyone. Youan use fertilizer grade potassium nitrate, (also known as salt peter, or niter) some BBQ charcoal adsome sulfur powder, all ground up separately. Three different percentages are given in #5

Black powder is one of the safest explosives, but it is very sensitive to sparks. These formulas areot for use in firearms. These formulas are more powerful than the ordinary powders used for firearm.
Gunpowder has many uses. You can put some in a tennis ball bomb for a greater effect, or in a small tal container. Just remember to pack the powder tightly and you have a simple bomb. Ignite with strn fuse (Vol.1 I)
or magnesium wire.

I didn't put the ingredients and procedure for Astrolite G in this issue  because I must double checwith someothers before giving you the secret. Besides it's the worlds most powerful nonnuclear explsve and I don't want to make any stupid mistakes. 

Next issue in Vol.III   Plastic Explosives, smokeless powder, and flash powder.
