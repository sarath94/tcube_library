
						MacGyver's Anarchy Vol.6
		

	In this Special Issue I will include some of MacGyver's devices from my favorite television Show Mayver.


	I was watching a rerun of MacGyver on tape and decided to make my next issues having MacGyver's deves etc. So here is the first one I decided to do. There will be wany more in the later issues of MaGver's Anarchy

XIII.                           Equiptment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
	Always cary your swiss army knife. They are so handy. I always cary one with me wherever I go.  Youknife can be a weapon and also a utensil. Need to open sometyhing? Use yor knife. Need to cut sometig? Use your knife. The swiss army knives do the job well. 

	Never leave home with you ducktape. Going to school have one in your backpack. If ducktape is too b go for one roll of electrical tape. Ducktape can be used as a sort of handcuff. Also you can use i s a blind fold, and also tape people's leggs together to prevent movement. Duck tape is very stron ad also slightly waterproof. You can use it for quick patches.

	If you are at school carry with you a filed down flathead screw driver, so that it can fit into theole of any lock. Don't file it down too much so that it bends when you try to pick a lock. Also car ome sort of pick. Any dissecting needle will do. Dlaod a couple of good lockpicking text, and pracic practice practice. You'll get it sooner or later. Its not too hard once you get the hang of it. he uys on T.V. always pick the locks too fast, or pick the locks with like a paper clip. Thats veryhardto do. 


	
XIV.                            Really Improvised Smoke Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


MacGyver used this one I'm about to write about for a diversion to get some keys from a nurse to frea friend. 

	Items needed
Carbon Black
Glove (any inflatable thing)
your knife
and your tape

Cut a 1 inch slit in the glove, then tape.Add some carbon black in the gloveand inflate. When tapinge sure to have an extra tail, so that when you rig it to something the tape will be released. Thus aing all the carbon black to be released in a cloud.




XV.                                     Nitroglycerin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	This was taken from the same episode. MacGyver prepared this explosive in a matter of seconds. UsinNitroglycerin Tablets (used for patients with heart problems) he ground it up in a mortar and pestl.Then he added a sml amout of alcohol to the ground up nitroglycerin. (MacGyver didn't mention whattye of alcohol. Sorry people) Stir very gently and now you have the very unstable nitroglycerin. MaGyvr used this to free his friend. He placed  the Nitroglycerin on the barred window, and threw a hrd oject at it and it blew up. Sounds like a lot of fun. 


Next Issue, I dunno, i've gotta review my collection of tpaes and find something good to write about
