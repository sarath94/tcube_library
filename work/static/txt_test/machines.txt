	Here is a way to rip off the coke machines you see out side of stores
and other places!  Ok, first on all vending machines there are always those
round almost unpickable locks when no one is looking take a peice of air
hardening clayy (make sure it is only air hardening!) and press it into the
lock real good!  Then remove the clay carefully and put it somewhere to dry!
Make sure the clay is TOTALY dry then go back in a day or so and you will have
a key to fit that lock put the key in and push and turn and presto the machine
will open allowing you to take all the money!  A good machine will get you
between 100 and 300 dollars depending when it was last checked by the company.
And best of all if someone sees you just put the key on the ground and step on
it and its powder, and then you cant be busted because the evidence is blown
away!  So that's it and if anyone has any good schemes, write a file on them
and add to the phringe phile collection.
