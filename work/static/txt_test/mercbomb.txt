2. If work, leave the switch on and unplug the cord
3. Unscrew the bulb (Dont touch the hot-spot!)
4. Place 1 Mercury Battery in the socket and make sure that
   it is touching the Hot-spot contact.
5. Move any object or furniture - Why? There may be sparx given off!

If your house is on fire (VERY RARE), get that damm fire blower!
This stuph will NOT destroy your plugs, but maybe the fuse depending
how often you do that....    Best try outside or college dorm...
