Mercury Fulminate
Reprinted from the Paladin Press Book, The Big Bang, improvised Petin and
Mercury Fulminate. Paladin Press book #ISBN 0-87364-437-9 by John Galt

Before the process is detailed, the reader is advised that Mercury
Fulminate is VERY sensitive to HEAT, FRICTION, IMPACT, and STATIC ELECTRICITY.
When working with this substance, use small amounts at a time and wear eye
protection.

HARDWARE NEEDED...
------------------------------

1.   Graduated Cylinder
2.   Two Glass containers each with a minimum of 1,000ml capacity.
3.   One large, heat resistant flask of one gallon capacity.
     (a large wine jug may work if a heat resistant flask is unavailable.)
4.   Glass funnel
5.   Blue litmus paper.

CHEMICALS NEEDED...
------------------------------

1.   600ml  70 percent nitric acid, reagent grade.
2.   160ml  distilled water
3.   900ml  ethanol alcohol, reagent grade.
4.   8ml  of mercury, reagent grade.

WARNING!!!! Make no substitutions for these chemicals or an explosion may
result!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PROCEDURE....
--------------------

(A)  Pour 150ml of distilled water into one of the glass containers.  Add the
     600ml of acid. Now add the 8ml of mercury to the acid and let dissolve
     COMPLETELY.  You will soon have a dark green liquid.  Allow this
     solution to cool to room temperature (65-70 degrees F.).

(B)  Pour the 900ml of alcohol into the second container; temperature should
     be between 65 and 70 degrees F.

(C)  Take the heat resistant flask and both containers outdoors in the open
     and away from people, as the next step causes the release of toxic gases.
     (DO NOT DO INDOORS!!!)

(D)  Pour the container of alcohol into the flask first.  Then add the green
     mercury acid solution to the flask. Use the funnel for easy pouring.

(E)  Move away from the flask.  In about ten to fourty five minutes, a thick
     white smoke will rise up out of the flask, indicating that the proper
     reaction is taking place.

(F)  After allowing the flask to stand for three hours, fill it with distilled
     water.  You will see the mercury fulminate crystals on the bottom of the
     flask.

(G) Pour the entire contents of the flask into a filter and wash the crystals
    with distilled water until the blue litmus paper indicates the water is
    neutral and free of acid.

(H)  Remove the crystals from the filter and allow them to dry completely.
     Store in a cool, dry place.  The mercury fulminate is now ready for use.
     The material should be a grey brown crystalline powder.

WARNING!!!!!!
------------------

When filling blasting caps with mercury fulminate, do not use copper, brass,
or aluminum jackets, as these metals react with mercury fulminate.  Instead
use stainless steel, glass, paper (Plastic ball point pen cases work very
well).  The jacket should be about 2.75 to 3.00 inches long and .25 inches
in diameter.  The loading density can be around two to three times the
density of the loose material.  The caps can be fixed with a fuse or by
heating wire.
