 A milk carton bomb is relatively simple and safe. It's only purpose is to
create a loud noise.
 The ingredients needed to make this are few and easy to aquire. You will need
a plastic milk carton, lighter fluid (type used in cigarette lighters), a piece
of paper, and a pair of chopsticks.  If you can not obtain chop sticks, it's
okay to substitute them with something that can hold the paper and is long
enough so that you won't be harmed by the flames.

 After aquiring all of the ingredients, you can now start to make the bomb.
The procedure is easy.  First, puncture a hole at the bottom of the milk carton
with a screw driver or equivalent.  Next fill one-fourth of the milk carton
with lighter fluid. Place the milk carton in a fairly large area outisde.  Hold
a piece of paper between the chopsticks and light the paper with a match.
Cautiously place the lighted paper under the hole of the carton and BOOM!  You
have your loud explosion with little damage to the surrounding area.  It would
be a good idea to have some water handy to extinguish any flames.

 Be careful when doing this and have fun.
