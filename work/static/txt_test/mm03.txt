                Get ready for a fun filled reading expidenture
         of majestic proportions.  Lotsa things to read and skip
         for the lazy.  In any case, all of the information in
         here has been tested and has been successful.  If you
         have any questions about what's in here, and what will
         be in the future, feel free to call my BBS and ask.  
         I'm always willing to help a fellow text file reader.

         DISCLAIMER: I WILL TAKE NO (zilch, nada, nicht, nein, 
 nope, uh-uh, negative, nothing at all) REPSONIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES
 FROM IMPROPER USE OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN.  THIS IS FOR
 INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND YOU ARE NOT TO TRY ANY OF THE 
 INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN.  



     1.  Purpose and Scope

         In Unconventional Warfare operations, it may be impossible 
 unwise to use conventional military munitions as tools in conduct 
 of certain missions (let alone GETTING such munitions will be a 
 pain as well).  It may be necessary instead to fabricate the 
 required munitions from the locally available or unassuming 
 materials.  The purpose of this text file and undoubtedly future 
 files is to increase the potential of the public by increasing the 
 knowledge of their mind and describing in detail the manufacture 
 of munition from seeminglu innocuous locally available materials.

         Manufactured, precision devices almost always will be more 
 effective, more reliable, and easier to use than improvised (made) 
 ones, but shelf items will just not be available for certain 
 operations or logistical reasons.  Therefore the operator will 
 have to rely on materials he can buy at a drug or a paint store, 
 find in a junk pile, or scrounge around in the garage.  Also, many 
 of the ingrediants and materials used in fabricating homemade 
 items are so commonplace or innocuous they can be carried without 
 arrousing suspicion.  The completed item itself is often more easily
 concealed or camouflaged.  In addition, the filed expedient item 
 can be tailored for the intended target, thereby providing an 
 advantage over the standard item in flexibility and verstaility.

                        Potassium Nitrate 

        Potassium Nitrate can be extracted from many natural 
 resources and can be used to make nitric acid, black powder, and 
 many pyrotechnics.  The yield ranges from .1 to 10% by weight, 
 depending on the fertility of the soil.

    MATERIALS                              SOURCE
   ~~~~~~~~~~~                            ~~~~~~~~

                                          Totally burned paper 
                                           (black)

   Bucket or similar container, 
    about 5 gallons (19 ltrs)
    in volume.  (plastic, metal 
    or wood)
   2 pieces of tightly woven cloth
    each slightly larger than 
    bottom of bucket
   A shallow heat-resistant 
    container
    (ceramic, metal, etc.)
   Shallow pan or dish, at least
    as large as bottom of bucket
   Water - 1-3/4 gallons 
    (6-3/4 ltrs.)
   Awl, knife, screwdriver, or 
    other puncturing 
instrument                                                     
   Alcohol about 1 gallon                         Go to Pharmor and 
    (rubbing alcohol)                              get 4 quarts for 
                                                   buck
   Heat source 
    (fire, electric heater, etc)
   Paper
   Tape

   (Note: Only the ratios of the amounts of ingrediants are 
 important.  Thus, for twice as much KNO3, double quantities used.)


    PROCEDURE
   ~~~~~~~~~~~   
    Punch holes in bottom of bucket.  Spread one piece of cloth 
 over the holes inside of bucket.

  that cannot under-    :o-o-o-o-o:
  stand the instructions 
  The dirt in comparison would be over 10x as much.)


  Place bucket over shallow container.  Bucket may be supported if
  necessary.
                        

                        \----------/
                        :--      --:    <--- bucket

   Boil water and pour it over the earth in bucket a little at a 
 time.  Allow water to run through holes in bucket into shallow 
 container.  Be sure the water goes through ALL of the earth.  
 Allow drained liquid to cool and settle for 1 to 2 hours.

        NOTE:  Do not pour all the water ast once, since this may 
 cause stoppage.

 Carefully drain off liquid into heat resistant container.  Discard 
 any sludge remaining in bottom of shallow container.

 Boil mixture over hot fire for at least 2 hours.  Small grains of 
 salt will appear.  Scoop these out with any type of strainer, or 
 use a spoon and put the water back in.
 
 When liquid has boiled down to half its original volume, remove 
 from fire and then let sit for half an hour.  Add an equal volume 
 of alcohol.  When mixture is poured through paper, small white 
 crystals will collect on top of it. 
 
 Allow to dry.   The potassium nitrate is ready for use.
