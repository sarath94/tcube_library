             Mindless Mayhem #9


             It's about 4:10 A.M. on Monday June 22 1991.  I no longer
             sleep, so in my quest to find something to do I bring you
             these two tidbits: "As American As Apple Pie" and "The
             F.A.C.T. About Censorship"  They are flyers I picked up on a
             recent trip to Chicago.
             ____________________________________________________________
                                            
                                            
                                            
                              "AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE"
                                            
             The right of free speech, the constitutional guarantees, the
             principles that this country was founded upon concentrated
             in the expression "Censorship is Un-American" - these have
             been articles of faith in the censorship movement.
              
             Who is the enemy?  The religious zealots, government
             bureaucrats, fascist minded legislators - who's goals and
             methods are seen as gross violations of what this country
             should be.  Or is it?  Are the inheritors of "we the people"
             those who defy the Helms, the Wildmans and Bushes - or are
             the thought police merely doing what is necessary to
             preserve and defend the traditions or the nation, Americas
             true standard bearers.
              
             This isn't academic.  If we reach for the constitution as a
             weapon to ward off the censors, what we pick up may not be a
             shield, but a snake.  If we see no farther than a return to
             "normalcy", of life without the interference of the PMRC,
             what then of those for whom "normalcy" has always been a
             living hell.  When a chance video reveals the everyday
             viciousness of the police to people of color, when public
             housing residents have the choice of submit or be evicted in
             the name of the war on drugs, when a homeless person can't
             even ask for a dime on a subway without being hauled off to
             jail, can one really call the relative opportunity for the
             middle class to express themselves - "freedom"?
              
             Censorship is not just what gets the blue pencil - there is
             much that falls to even make it that far though America's
             cultural and intellectual meatgrinder.  There is no need to
             'ban' women artists when so few are shown.  There is no need
             to 'enforce' a white ethos in children's books, when 95% are
             already devoid of any other race.  Given the consequences
             should a teacher attempt to explain the experience of gay
             people in your average American classroom - why bother
             'forbidding' it.  It is only a consequence of the massive
             rebellions in the 60's that there exists some diversity in a
             few pockets here and there.  Is it not ironic that the
             assault on those alternative voices that exist is being done
             in the name of freedom, of overthrowing the "tyranny" of
             "political correctness" and "multiculturalism".

             What is at stake is more than some men being denied their
             god given right to wack off to men's magazines, is bigger
             than just "me doing whatever the fuck I want" - it is, and
             has been a life and death question for all those considered
             'outside' the mainstream of America.  Is it any surprise
             that most of those being targeted today are voices for those
             sections of people who've always been on Americas hit list -
             people of color, defiant women, gays and lesbians, middle
             class youth who've gone over to the 'enemy' - has America
             ever been a place where this has not been the case?
              
             On July 4th, we will be subjected [TWB Note- we WERE
             subjected] to what promises to be an obscene orgy of self-
             congratulations over the successful slaughter of the Iraqi
             people.  Awash in yellow ribbons, drenched in red, white and
             blue - in the name of celebrating the uniqueness of Americas
             freedoms, eyes will be averted from those unfortunate images
             of horror and degradation that define the real new world
             order.  It nourishes a climate being molded where
             suppression of new reinforces perpetuation of stereotypes to
             enable a heavy hand to keep in place all those 'not with the
             program.'
              
             What better a time for a different voice to be heard, for
             the real questions of the day [TWB note- or ANY day] to be
             raised.  "Censorship: As American As Apple Pie" - needs to
             be addressed through discussion, debate and by putting the
             ideas, views, and expressions deemed verboten on center
             stage.  "Submit" will be the official message this July 4th,
             let us deliver a better one, of liberation - that we will
             not acquiesce, we will not be silenced, and it is definitely
             not us who will be made to go away.
