File number 3 in the "Simple devices" series, written by

Mortar:  Basically, that's exactly what this is.  It shoots
         out projectiles that explode on contact.  Useful
         for small scale war.


Materials:  4 or 5 cans.

            Strong tape (or a welder if you can get your
                         hands on one)

            Matches (MUST be "eddy lights" (the ones with
                     the different coloured tip))

            Squashball or dogball, as long as it's holow
            (a tennis ball can be used, but you need cans
            wide enough to house it)

            Ronson's lighter fluid

            Will to blow something up.


     Basically, this device is quite easily made, you just
need some good tools to do it properly.  First, take one
of the cans, and cut the entire top of of it (this might
be hard with pop cans, since they have a high edge which gets
in the way of using a can opener).  Then, on the bottom of
the can, cut about 3/4 of it out, so you have a semi-circle
of tin missing on the bottom, like in this diagram.

Do exactly the same thing to all the rest of the cans as
explained above (NOT the last one though), making sure that
the open part in the bottom of each can alternates with the
one below it.  In other words, if you looked down the barrel
of the thing, you'd see a semi-circle missing on the left,
then the right (directly opposite) then the left etc.  It
must look this way.  When you get to your last can, leave
the bottom on and still cut the whole top off.  Now you
must tape/weld all these cans together (with the one with
the bottom on the bottom, naturally).  This might be hard
if you used pop-cans since the edges would be very rough
(because you'd need to actually CUT off the top, not use
a can opener).  Anyway, now that's done.  Last, make a
small hole in the side of the bottom can (as close as you
can get to the bottom).  It just has to be big enough to
squirt the Ronson's inside.  Next, you need to make
"Roly Poly Match Heads" (tm)*.  You must find a ball that
is hollow, and will fit as best as possible in the cans, so
it doesn't wobble too much, but doesn't have trouble coming
out the end.  Make a small slice in the ball (not a hole),
and start pouring in cut off match heads (eddy lights,
remember) until it's quite tightly packed.  Put this down
the barrel of the mortar, tilt it upright at about a 45
degree angle.  Squirt some ronsons into the small hole at
the bottom (and a bit around the hole, in case it doesn't
catch right away), light it, and BOOM.  The ball should
go VERY far if the cannon is made well, and it will
explode when it lands to boot!

*Roly Poly Match Heads are a trademark of Night Crawler (also
(tm) but I won't mention why).  And a full explanation is
found it "The Anarchy Files Volume III" A.O.A. radio
productions, Christmas day 1987 (what a guy).
