This issue will discuss how to construct a simple rocket
launcher.

Materials: ABS piping (at least 8 inch diamter, so the
           fins of the rocket can be fit inside, and it
           should be about 4 feet long).  Also get
           a smaller piece of ABS piping about 1 foot long
           and 3 inches wide (home hardware will tell you
           what diameters the piping comes in exactly).  This
           one foot piece will need to be cut in half with
           a hack saw.

           Switch (get it at Radio shack)

           9 volt battery

           Alligator clips (Radio shack of shit)

           Small rocket (buy smallest size at Merry Land toys
                         at Bloor and Yonge)

           3 "A" sized engines.

           Solar flares (3 come with the engines, but it's
                         good to get another pack of them)

           Mine (see file #1 in this series).  This is if
           you want an explosion at the end.


   Relatively easy (as I always say) to build.  After you've
cut the small pice of ABS in half.  Tape the two "handles"
to the bottom of the larger piece of ABS (the launcher
itself), one will act as the front handle, and the other will
have the "switch" on it.  Tape them in places where it's
comfortable to you.  You will be holding it most likely
on your right shoulder, and your left arm will be out front
supporting you, and your right arm will be close into you,
ready to pull the switch, and the back end of the barrel will
be resting on your shoulder (don't worry, barely anything
comes out the back, just a bit of smoke).  Next put the
rocket together (you can read the instructions yourself).
*BUT*, since the rocket only supplies fins for the back end
(because your supposed to be launching it up, not less than
something like 70 degress (which is considered "ballistic"
ALLRIGHT!)), you will have to make makeshift fins for the
from so the rocket is pointing straight ahead inside the
launcher, not the from end sagging down, and only the
back end up.  The good part about getting the smallest rocket
is, the transparent film cannisters (once again, they are
the better of the two types, so ask for those), have sort
of a circle that juts out on the lid, which fits EXACTLY into
the cardboard body of the rocket.  So, viola, you can put
a mine (tm) on the front (see file #1).  It seems they make
these things fit nicely just for us anarchist's doesn't it?
Anyway, once you have the rocket built, you should now hook
up some long wire to the switch you have, and have one
end going to the battery, and from the other terminal on
the battery to the rocket, and the other end of the switch
to the rocket.  Here's a diagram, for the eletrically
ignorant (just joking, I'm just a shitty explainer).

             [_& E  &_]                   flare, which is
                                          in the back of the
                                          engine.
 & = ABS plastic





Obviously, if you have a mine, the "button" on the top
of the mine will be facing outwards, so when it lands, boom.
The weight of the engine should balance the weight of the
bomb on the front.  Well, there you have it.  Just point,
and launch!
