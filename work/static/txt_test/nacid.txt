Nitric Acid


Nitric acid  is used in the  preparation of many explosives,
incendiary  mixtures,  and  acid  delay  timers.  It  may be
prepared by  distilling a mixture  of potassium nitrate  and
concentrated sulfuric acid.

MATERIALS REQUIRED
------------------------------------------------------------

Potassium nitrate (2 parts by volume)

Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 part by volume)

2 bottles or ceramic jugs (narrow necks are preferable)

Pot or frying pan

Heat source (wood, coal, or charcoal)

Tape (paper, electrical, masking, etc)

Paper or rags.

IMPORTANT: If sulfuric acid is obtained from a motor vehicle
battery,  concentrate it  by  boiling  it until  white fumes
appear, DO NOT INHALE FUMES IF YOU ENJOY LIFE!!

NOTE: The amount of nitric acid  produced is the same as the
amount  of potassium  nitrate. Thus,  for 2  table spoons of
nitric acid,  use 2 tablespoons  of potassium nitrate  and 1
tablespoon of concentrated sulfuric acid.

CAUTION: Sulfuric acid will burn skill and destroy clothing.
If any  is spilled, wash  it away with  a large quantity  of
water. Fumes are dangerous and  should not be inhaled. Store
and handle with glass or epoxy plastics.


PROCEDURE:
===========================================================

1)  Place  dry  potassium  nitrate  in  bottle  or  jug. Add
sulfuric  acid. Do  not fill  bottle more  the 1/4 full. Mix
until paste is formed.

2)  Wrap paper  or rags  around necks  of 2 bottles. Securly
tape necks  of bottles together.  Be sure bottles  are flush
against each other and that there are no air spaces.

3) Support bottles on rocks or  cans so that empty bottle is
slightly lower  then bottle containing paste  so that nitric
acid that  is formed in  receiving bottle will  not run into
other bottle.

4)  Build fire in port or frying pan.

5) Gently  heat bottle containing mixture  by moving fire in
and  out. As  red fumes  begin to  appear, periodically pour
cool  water over  empty receiving  bottle. Nitric  acid will
begin to form in the receiving bottle.

CAUTION: Do not overheat or  get the heated bottle wet. This
can cause the bottle to shatter.  A safer method is to place
the heated bottle into a can on a bed of sand. Then heat the
can.

6) Continue  the above process  until no more  red fumes are
formed. If the nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is
not clear  (cloudy at all)  pour it into  cleaned bottle and
repeat steps 2-6.
