Nitric Acid / Nitroethane Explosive.

  It is fairly well known that highly concentrated nitric acid (95+ percent)
can be used in conjunction with various materials to form a simple but
powerful 2-component high explosive. Highly concentrated nitric acid, how-
ever, is not commercially available in many areas and is expensive where it
is. The following mixture uses 70 percent nitric acid, which is the most
widely available strength.
  Nitroethane is a common industrial solvent that is quite cheap in bulk. It
is also safer to use and store than most solvents, including acetone. It can
be detonated by a #8 blasting cap. Because of the corrosive nature of nitric
acid, the blasting cap and wires should be coated eith wax or acid-resistant
epoxy paint. This mixture, although not overly sensitive, should still be
handled with care. Adding the nitroethane to the nitric acid at the blasting
area provides maximum safety because nitric acid is not an explosive until
this is done. When priming de sure the blasting cap is centered in the liq-
uid. The detonating velocity of this explosive is 6,645 meters per second,
roughly equivalent in power to TNT. A 1-pound charge is prepared as follows:

  1) Pour 219 milliliters (310 grams) of 70 percent nitric acid into
     a 1-pint acid-resistant container.
  2) Add 144 grams of nitroethane.
  3) Prime and seal with wax or other acid-resistant material.
  4) Blast.
