  Disclaimer:  I take no responsibility for what the fuck people
               do from reading this file.  If I repeat something
               from another file, please excuse me.


1] Place impact explosives all over a dark street.

2] Pretend you're Rambo and go out and shoot anything you don't
   like with a high powered BB gun.

3] Drop a can of soda into a mail box.

4] Pour gas or kerosene all over a door..set up a fuse, ring the
   door and run!

5] Switch around the neighbors lawn furniture.

6] If you have a lot of people over you can switch around the
   neighbors sub-compact car's.

7] Break into the door of a house that the owners are not at and
   just leave it open...watch them flip out trying to find what
   was stolen.

8] Repeat most of above but leave rubber's and shit on their bed.

9] Repeat most of above but take anything that look's good.

10] Some guy near you that you hate single?  Call 911 from a pay
    phone and tell them you saw the guy drag a girl into his
    house and that she was bleeding.

11] Your neighbors are hungry...order them some pizza.
                                                                               
12] Order a hated person a subscription to gay news.

13] Order loads of that stuff you see on tv that accept C.O.D.

14] Paint pentagrams and shit in gasoline on the guy's garage
    door and lighter up!

15] On a fake credit card order the guy all the shit you can.
    Try writing a letter first telling him he won all the shit.

17] Call someone and tell them they will win $1000 if they answer
    a trivial pursuits question right.  My favorite question that
    has only once been answered right is:  How many bones are
    there in the human body?

18] Know someone's daughter is out at a party?  Call up the
    parents and tell them you are the police and that their
    daughter has been brought into the local police station on a
    controlled substance charge. Hehehe 

19] Ring the door bell and wait...(the later at night for this
    the better...3:00am is good)  keep ringing till the door is
    answered...when it is ask if the party is still going?  When
    they tell you they know nothing about any party just say
    'holy fucking shit!  I drove all the way from "so 'n so" and
    their is no goddamn mother fucking party...and I brought 20
    joints with me' then walk away.

20] Take a blowtorch and write nice sayings in walkway's and
    wall's...then you can use the torch to mangle the door know
    and the mail boxes...

21] Last but not least...pour some gas into a mail box and then
    slide in a fuse...jam the mail box door partway open and
    lighter up.

  I hope you enjoy the nice ideas introduced in this file.  I
tried to keep it simple so that's it for now.  Look for " Funthing's II:
a bit more technical."
