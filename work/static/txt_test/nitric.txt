                        HOW TO MAKE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES

A PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER CAN BE MADE FROM POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND PETROLEUM
JELLY. THIS EXPLOSIVE CAN BE DETONATED IN ANY MILITARY BLASTING CAP. (FIND A
FRIEND IN THE SERVICE OR IN THE RESERVE, OR STEAL ONE).

MATERIALS:
----------
POTASSIUM CHLORATE - THIS CHEMICAL IS USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES, AND IN
                     THE MANUFACTURE OF MATCHES.

PETROLEUM JELLY - JUST GET SOME VASELINE OR NO-NAME BRAND.

PIECE OF ROUND STICK

WIDE BOWL OR OTHER CONTAINER FOR MIXING INGREDIENTS.


PROCEDURE:
----------
1) SPREAD THE POT. NIT. CRYSTALS THINLY ON A HARD SURFACE.  ROLL THE ROUND
STICK
   OVER THE CRYSTALS TO CRUSH INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHEAT FLOUR.

2) PLACE 9 PARTS POWDERED POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND 1 PART PETROLEUM JELLY IN A
   WIDE BOWL OR SILILAR CONTAINER.  MIX THE INGREDIENTS WITH YOUR HANDS
(KNEAD)
   UNTIL A UNIFORM PASTE IS OBTAINED.

STORE THE EXPLOSIVE IN A WATERPROOF CONTAINER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO USE IT.



PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES-

    MIX 7 PARTS POTASSIUM CHLORATE FOR EVERY ONE PART OF PETROLEUUM JELLY
    (VASELINE WILL DO) THEN USE AN ELECTRIC CHARGE OR A FUSE.

NITRO IODIDE-

    OK, THIS IS HOW TO MAKE NITRIC IODIDE. MIX SOME SOLID IODINE WITH
    HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA. WAIT OVERNIGHT. POUR OFF THE LIQUID. LET THE MUD FROM
    THE BOTTOM DRY ON A HARD SURFACE OUTSIDE LIKE CONCRETE. THROW SOMETHING ON
    IT. IT WILL GO OFF AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE BECAUSE IT IS SO UNSTABLE.
