NITROGLYCERIN [HERETOFORE NITRO] IS A VERY POWERFUL HIGH-EXPLOSIVE.  I AM NOT
SURE WHO INVENTED IT BUT HE PROBABLY DIDN'T--THE FIRST PERSON TO MAKE IT
PROBABLY BLEW HIMSELF UP AND HIS FREIND GOT THE INFO OFF HIS NOTES.  WELL
ANYWAY, THE NEXT BEST THING TO NITRO IS TNT WHICH IS TEN TIMES HARDER TO MAKE
BUT ALSO TEN TIMES SAFER TO MAKE.  IF YOU CAN'T USE NSE THEN DON'T EVEN TRY TO
MAKE THIS STUFF--A FEW DROPS CAN PRODUCE DEADLY RESULTS.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     TO MAKE NITRO:
     == ==== ======

MIX 100 PARTS FUMING NITRIC ACID (FOR BEST RESULTS IT SHOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC
GRAVITY OF 50 DEGREES BAUME') WITH 200 PARTS SULPHURIC ACID.  THIS IS GOING TO
BE HOT AT FIRST--IT WON'T SPLATTER IF YOU POUR THE NITRIC INTO THE SULPHURIC
BUT DON'T TRY IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.  THE ACID SOLUTIONS TOGETHER CAN DISOLVE
FLESH IN A MATTER OF SECONDS SO TAKE THE PROPER MEASURES FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!
WHEN COOL, ADD 38 PARTS GLYCERIN AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE.  LET IT TRICKLE DOWN
THE SIDES OF THE CONTAINER INTO THE ACIDS OR IT WON'T MIX THOURILY AND THE
REACTION COULD GO TO FAST--WHICH CAUSES ENOUGH HEAD TO IGNITE THE STUFF.  STIR
WITH A **GLASS** ROD FOR 15 SECONDS OR SO THE CAREFULLY POUR IT INTO 20 TIMES
IT'S *VOLUME* OF WATER.  IT WILL VISIBLY PRECIPITATE IMMEDIATLY.  THERE WILL BE
TWICE AS MUCH NITRO AS YOU USED GLYCERIN AND IT IS EASY TO SEPARATE.  MIX IT
WITH BAKING SODA AS SOON AS YOU HAVE SEPARATED IT--THIS HELPS IT NOT TO GO OFF
SPONTAINOUSLY.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

NOTES:  PARTS ARE BY WEIGHT AND THE BAUME' SCALE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY CAN BE
FOUND IN MOST CHEM. BOOKS.  YOU CAN GET FUMING NITRIC AND SULFURIC ACIDS
WHEREEVER GOOD CHEMICALS OR FERTILIZERS ARE SOLD.  IT IS POSITIVLY *STUPID* TO
MAKE MORE THAN 200 GRAMS OF NITRO AT A TIME.  WHEN MIXING THE STUFF WEAR
GOGGLYS, GLOVES, ETC.  WHEN I FIRST MADE THE STUFF I HAD THE HONOR OF HAVING IT
GO OFF BY ITSELF (I ADDED TOO MUCH GLYCERINE AT A TIME.)  I WAS ACROSS THE ROOM
AT THE TIME, BUT I FELT THE IMPACT--SO DID THE TABLE IT WAS ON AS WELL AS THE
WINDOW IT WAS NEXT TO--THEY WERE BOTH SMASHED BY ONLY 25 GRAMS IN AN OPEN BOWL.
OH, YES, GLYCERINE YOU CAN GET ANY PHARMACY AND YOU NEED AN ADULT SIGNATURE FOR
THE ACIDES.  ANY BUMP CAN MAKE NITRO GO OFF IF YOU DON'T ADD THE BICARBONATE OF
(BAKING) SODA--BUT EVEN WITH THAT, IF IT GETS OLD, I WOULDN'T PLAY CATCH WITH
IT.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

ONCE YOU HAVE MADE THE NITRO AND SATURATED IT WITH BICARB. YOU CAN MAKE A
REALLY PWERFUL EXPLOSIVE THAT WON'T GO OFF BY ITSELF BY SIMPLY MIXING IT WITH
AS MUCH COTTON AS YOU CAN AND THEN SATURATING THAT WITH MOLTEN PARIFINE--JUST
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT SELED AND HARD.  TYPICALLY, USE THE SAME AMOUNTS (BY WEIGHT)
OF EACH NITRO, COTTON AND PARIFINE.  THIS, WHEN WRAPPED IN NEWSPAPER, WAS ONCE
KNOWN AS "NORBIN & OHLSSON'S PATENT DYNAMITE," BUT THAT WAS BACK IN 1896.
