so you say you had a dream last night
about hijacking a twa and taking it
to lebanon....well this should provide
you with many exciting nights and
distraught neighbors.
 
 
for these exercises you will need the
following items:
 
10 m-16's
15 shrapnel grenades
2 flamethrowers
2-3 spools of fish line
    (the stronger the better)
3-4 packs of bottle rockets
3-4 packs of m-80's
3-4 packs of 'jumping jacks'
20 small balloons
water ..hmm what could that be for?
eggs...optional
4 bricks
3-6 10 ball roman candles
a 6 inch tube about big enough for
    a marker to fit in and closed
    at one end
spool of string
10-20 empty liter bottles (like pepsi)
{      or some coffee cans
1 roll of transparent tape
some tacks or nails
a small mallet or hammer
lawn mower w/bag
a tarp
a couple newspapers
a few centerfolds...use some ugly ones
a pocketknife
some dark clothing
black shoes if possible
panty hose....optional
an empty 16 oz. pepsi bottle
a old rag
some gas or kerosene
some alcohol
2-3 ping-pong balls
gunpowder
2-3 feet of fuse...optional but
     recomended
a lighter or 2-3 packs of matches
a can of wd-40 or almost any aerosol
a good lock
charming face w/fast legs
a pair of pliers
a quater or half-dollar
a wire-cutter
a large and small screwdriver
4-5 small paper bags
ample supply of dog shit
2 watermelons
a candle
a smoke bomb
a bong...optional but it definitely
         heightens the experience and
         you will feel more apt to try
         and accompish these feats
 
basic terrorism:
----------------
ok....the below ideas are for the new
and unexperienced terrorist....they
are mainly just for fun and have
quick results
 
holding up traffic:
well what would you do if you were 
driving down the road around 2 am 
half-drunk,stoned,and wasted and saw
little...maybe not so little...balls
of colored flame shooting through the
air ahead from the road?....well you
would either freak and go straight
or more likely freak and wreck...that
is the whole idea....to do this you
use 1 or 2 10 ball roman candles and
the bricks.....to assemble place two
bricks side by side about an inch
apart and then place a third brick
behind them on the opposite side from
which you want it to shoot....then
place another brick on top of the
first two and place and aim the candle
in the space between the bricks.
 
the next trick is yard littering...
to do this spread a tarp on the grass
and place a crumpled newspaper in the
tarp....then run over it with your
lawn mower....transfer the now
shredded newspaper to another bag and
decorate someone's lawn.
 
while you are at it tape a centerfold
on the glass door and give 'em a ring
then use those fast legs to haul ass
 
now if you truly hate these people
you can give someone a good deal
of small cuts by hammering the tacks
or nails on the molding around the 
door....then string some fish line 
around the nails at any height or all
up and down the door.
 
now this trick won't work to well at
night but will during a two-period
chemisrty lab....just hold a quarter
over your bunsen burner or lighter
for a few minutes and toss it into the
hall when the bell ring...someone will
learn to not pick everything up off
the ground.
 
another idea for school requires a
candle and a smoke bomb....tape the 
candle to the smoke bomb leaving the 
wick about 1-2 inches above the fuse..
leave this in the school bathroom...
light it and in about 10 minutes when
the candle burns down the smoke bomb
will go off....of course you'll be 
~r~s{talking to a teacher or in class about
the time it goes off leaving you in
the clear
 
genuine fun:
------------
find a good road in your neighborhood
or somewhere else where only one car
will be going by at a time....if the
road is too busy this won't work...
now take some fish line and get enough
to stretch across the road and clear 
it on both sides by 2-3 feet....you
must also find a place with mail boxes
or electric boxes across the road from
each other....now tie the fish line to
two of the liter bottles on each side
...the idea is to set the line up so
it will be just above fender level
you must also make sure that while the
bottles will not fall over that the 
will come off when a car passes....
after a car passes watch and see how 
far your little present stays with
them...coffee can may be preferred
because they produce a more pleasing
effect to the ears when dragging 
behing the victim...also don't stand
too close to the line incase you 
catch an ulikely jogger
 
also did you ever believe in santa as
a kid...well we have a new variation
on chimney suprises...just go by the
nearest supermarket and obtain (how
ever you want) a watermelon...
decorating the watermelon is optional
becuase it is likely that the
decorations will be messed up during
action.....anywayz now for
hard part....in some way climb up to
the top of their chimney and drop the
water melon down their chimney...if 
there is one of those damn grates on
top take it home for a souvenir
 
ever seen those luminaria things
around christmas time?...well this
idea can be used at the same time as
the fake santa to create a real
feeling of christmas and 'gift'-giving
ok now....take that ample supply of
shit and fill some little paper bags
(about 4)...then spray it with gas
and leave your 'gift' on someone's
porch  and light the bag....then ring
the door..haul ass...and watch to see
if the person is in a christmassy
spirit....by the way watch to see if
they try and stomp it out...that's
messy eh?
 
obvious:
--------
of course don't forget to smash the
pumpkins on halloween
 
bottle rockets shot from hand-held 
tubes at joggers or passing cars
 
trip wires or clothes-lines across
well-traveled paths
 
you say you hear a bed squeakin 
through the window?...well take a
look with your high-powered lantern
or headlights....ever seen two people
jump so quick?
 
placing or re-placing a lock on a
storage shed or crawlspace
 
ring and run with jumping jacks and
m-80's left for their viewing 
pleasure
 
toss someone's doormat or paper up
on their roof
 
climb on mr. neighbor's roof and
slam dance with your friends...then
when he comes out cover him with shit
or just run
 
tying fish line to someone's knocker
and while spooling out extra and being
careful not to pull it taunt walk 
across the street and take out your 
bottle rockets and tube....then when
you're set up pull the line and hold
your lighter ready...then when someone
answers let 'em have it...good aim
pays off here!!!
 
and of course water balloons...but
with a twist...make sure that these
are small...like no bigger than a
shrunken baseball...and also make sure
that they are white....to a casual
observer (no such thing really) it
will look like eggs...also do this
from a car with hard-rock blasting...
then 'egg' everything in sight...of
course you don't have to fill them 
with water...it can be mud,shaving 
cream,or milk for a better splattering
effect
 
pyro fun:
---------
go to your local roses and pick up
some ping-pong balls (unless you still
play it outside of pe) and drill a
whole in the top....now fill it up 
with some gun powder...to light this 
(your gone if you casually light it
by hand) either make a trail with gas
and light that or use a fuse about 2 
ft. long...needless to say haul ass to
watch this....if it works it will
shoot a falme in the air for a decent
while or simply explode
 
have you ever sprayed anything across
your lighter?....well it can have
some interesting applications....first
its a nice little torch...then its a
big improvement over your lighter...
and then its a bomb (you will have 
found this out by now if you sprayed
that wd-40 for too long)...to make
this first take that little button off
the top and place some duct tape over
the little nozzle holding it down....
then punch a hole in the tape above 
the nozzle....the can should now be
continuously spraying now....and any
day now whenever you feel like it just
strike a match and need i reapeat haul
ass
 
now lets's try an experiment....ever
made a molotov cocktail?...do you
know what that is?...basically its
a cheap type bomb that was used in
wwi by resistors with no other ammo.
how to construct a molotov cocktail:
ok now like i said this is an 
experiment....get your 16 oz. pepsi
bottle (or coke if you want to tell
them that you don't like it now)
and fill with gas,kerosene,or both....
now soak a rag in gas and let it dry..
then stuff the bottom half into the
mouth of the bottle...now find a 
nice lookin porche or open field,light
the rag and throw(you better toss it 
quick too!)....this isn't supposed
to explode but rather throw flaming
gas everywhere for a big radius...so
stay clear...maybe you could drop it
off a bridge or from a tall tree if
you're a monkey
 
 
electrical terrorism:
---------------------
 
messing up the meter....you know that
damned little bubble on the side of
your house (or shack)?....well that's
a kilowatt meter...it tells the power
co. how much power you used by the
little circles inside....now messing
with these can be fun esp. if it isn't
yours.....keep in mind it's a felony..
but who cares? right?....ok now there
is usually a little plastic tag with
a looped wire hanging that acts as
a lock because they are about
impossible to get back on....if you
live near a construction site you may
be able to pick a few good replacement
tags,thus allowing you to screw with 
yours...or make someone's elses story
about not using so much power very
hard to believe....simply rip that
tag off and open the box and turn the
little dials:
 
 
   1  2     1  2    1  2    1  2
  6    3   6    3  6    3  6    3
   5  4     5  4    5  4    5  4
 
ok now that's what it should look like
...just as on an odometer (the mileage
in your car) the right side stands for
parts of a kilowatt hour and then the
next dial is for the digits...the next
for tens....and then for hundreds or 
something like that...anywayz just 
play around with these until you feel
relieved....now i'm not sure about 
this....you can probably turn off the
people's power by madly cutting every
wire in sight...be sure to use an
insulated wire cutter or wear gloves
otherwise you may be found in the 
morning and they seeing your charred
body holding wire cutters will
suspect what you were up to and may
ruin your funeral service for your
friends...
 
now for water meters...one of the most
effective way to gain revenge on 
some bastard that you hate is to turn
off his water...the reason this is 
such an effective means of revenge, 
is because getting caught is very 
difficult unless you are seen...simply
open the cover of their water meter
and look for a small knob, (most have 
this) use your pliers or wrench to 
turn the knob, if you are unsure which
way is off, remember where you start, 
and turn which ever way is easier
until it stops,in the morning you will 
know if your little scheme has worked,
you can expect to see mr. neighbor
take a leisurly walk to the front lawn
carrying a pair of pliers...
 
telephone services.....
first of all nighttime provides a
unique opportunity for boxing and
trying out your new boxes to make sure
that they work...do this via beige box
or bud box....ok now back to terrorism
....there are a variety of things to
do to someones telephone line...to get
to a single house's phone line find
the little silver box on the back of
their house....use your screwdriver to
open it and have fun...you can rewire,
cut off service,or make any calls
you want via a beige box knowing that
anything you do will be held against
their phone line....there is also the
matter of those more interesting
larger boxes with the shitty little
bell on them....once you get into
these the possibilities are even
bigger.....how about disconnecting
the entire neighborhood (guess this
won't be in yours eh?)...well anywayz
if you have read the beige box plans
you can also listen to any 
conversations taking place by using
the alligator clips....
 
ok finally cable....(if you live in
the boondocks you may not be able to
do this)
ok open that little green box or what
ever color it is and again just have
fun switching the wires
