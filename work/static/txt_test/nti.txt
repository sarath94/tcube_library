     I Nitrogen Tri-Iodide I
     -----------------------

Materials:
    Iodine Crystals- 4 grams
    Ammonia- enough to cover crystals, twice
    Distilled water- enough to cover crystals once


  Put iodine crystals in a pan, then pour the amonia over them. Let sit for 15
min., then pour off the liquid on the top into a test tube(or what ever). Do
this same step a second time, and pour the liquid into the same container.
Then pour distilled water over the iodine crystals. Let that sit for 15 min.
, and pour off that liquid into the same container as above. Mix the liquids
together(preferably with a glass rod), and that is the Nitrogen tri-iodide.
Save the iodine crystals for a later use of the same thing. You can use the
crystals until they disolve.

  The NI3 is good stuff to use for fun. It makes alot of noise, but has little
force. This stuff has been used at Parent-Teacher meetings, or any such
gatherings at schools, or buisiness.

  The NI3 is exreamly stable in its liquid form. But when it is allowed to dry,
it becomes so unstable that ONE DUST HEAD could set it off. And when used in
ball form, it can be dangerous, since it will be more compact and have more
force.
