Detonators:
-------------
        The following section will deal with common detonators made using simple
electronic components found at your local radio shack......

One type of excellent detonator is the ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR. The electrolytic
capacitor does not like to be reverse biased, when reverse biased a small one will
fizzle a bit and moke, but a large capacitor will EEXXPPLLOODDEE. Voltage should be
about 12
0 volts for this. Simply stick the capacitor into your bomb, maxi-pad etc... hook it
up to any type of switch flip the switch and the capacitor will explode, and so will
your bomb.

Another electronic detonator:
-----------------------------
        
        Another extremely simple detonator can be created using a solar ignitor. You
will need a SOLAR IGNITOR, 9v BATTERY, 3 FLEXIBLE WIRES, A SWITCH, 9v BATTERY CLIP. I
will give you step by step instruction on the assembly of this device so the even po
indexter out there will understand:

1) Connect two wires to the switch, one to battery clip, one to a solar ignitor lead.

2) connect the third wire from the other battery clip wire the the last solar ignitor
lead.

There it is, flip switch and go....

Yet another electronic detonator:
---------------------------------

        By far this is the simplest detonator and easiest to build. All you will need
is a flashlight light bulb, a 9v battery (the more powerful the battery the better of
course) and a switch. rig the battery and the bulb to the switch, pack it into your
 explosive, flip switch and watch your handiwork. One more thing make sure to break the
glass so there is only the silver part and the filament showing.
 
A nasty prank:

        So ya wanna give your "buddy" the shock of his life..... Charge up an
electrolytic capacitor. 

*WARNING: Electrolytic capacitor store electricity for indeterminate time periods never
touch the cap!

Ok now that it is charged take a pair of insulated tongs and whip it at your "buddy",
I garuntee he'll think twice before he comes over to your house again. (he,he)
