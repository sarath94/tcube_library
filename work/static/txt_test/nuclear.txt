Nuclear material doesn't magically appear at plants that make missiles and 
bombs.  It has to be transported by truck or train.  The media has seen fit 
to portray a totally false picture of the security surrounding the operation. 
Getting enriched Uranium or Plutonium is seen as marginally difficult, just 
force a lone semi off the road and loot it.  I hope to give the true picture 
of the task and of the equipment. 
This report has been compiled with the help (knowing and unknowing) of the US 
Department of Energy, the APCO Journal, and a source in FEMA. 
  
                                 The Locations 
  
Oak Ridge,TN.  Union Carbide runs a Uranium enrichment plant here.  It has a 
               sister complex in Paducah Ky. that makes Uranium Hexafluoride, 
               a deadly gas that is sometimes transported on the Interstates. 
  
Amarillo,TX.   The most dangerous city on earth. A little known factory, the 
               Pantex Company, takes the enriched fissionable materials and 
               assembles them into warheads.  The equipment is vintage 1950. 
               Accidents are unheard of.  They may happen, but the press 
               sure never gets word of them. 
  
Albuquerque, 
NM.            Sandia National Labs, under contract to the Depatment of Ener- 
               gy, performs research on weapons and radioactive materials. 
               Kirkland AFB, communications command center for the DOE is 
               also located here. 
  
San Francisco, 
CA.            Lawrence Livermore Lab also performs research on the more 
               classified aspects of nuclear ahemistry. 
  
Chicago, IL.   Argonne Labs research "peaceful" applications of highly 
               radioactive metals and gases.  Sure thing... 
  
Joplin, MO.    The largest contractor of freight-hauling for DOE is based 
               in the Southwestern tip of MO.  I'd like to take a tour of 
               Tri-State Motor Transit (TSMT) sometime.  I'd also like an 
               unescorted day in the Pentagon.  I have as much chance at 
               getting either one. 
  
                             The Transit Process. 
  
A surprise in store: the actual drivers are heavily armed, excellently 
trained DOE Special Couriers.  The ride to a spelly equipped sem 2 
ormi's and 4 to 5 support vehicles to a convoy.  The support staff also 
consists of Couriers in a variety of vehicles.  Most of the time they include 
a Motorhome, a Suburban (armored) and possibly a station wagon or two. 
If a cop tries to pull over a semi, the entire convoy pulls over.  A courier 
in the offending vehicle uses the PA to announce the nature of the convoy, and

will exit the truck if requested.  The driver NEVER exits. 
  
                             Spotting a Convoy 
  
  The actual semi's are usually unmarked (DOE-owned), or are turquoise with 
regular silver trailers that may bear the logo TSMT.  In NO case will they 
bear a yellow & black "Radioactive" Placard.  DOE vehicles bear a single 
license tag, blue on white, that starts with an "E".  The semi's have what 
appears to be a luggage rack on the top.  This is an antenna.  They may 
stop at weigh stations, but will be waved on through. 
  
                                The Weapons 
  
  Couriers are trained in use of the standard issue M-16, the M-60, and the 
LAW rocket.  They carry at least that amount of weapons with them, and 
possibly the new Viper Antitank weapon.  Other items include gas (BZ, CS) 
and maybe a few goodies from the Farm...  Their training in Colorado Springs, 
CO. takes about 3 months and covers everything from evasive driving with a 
130,000 pound armored tractor-trailer to recovery of fissionable material 
from adversaries to emergency field evacuation and containment.  Their 
trucks are probably the best weapons.  DOE-owned vehicles, used for the most 
hazardous materials (transit of old warheads for reconditioning) are totally 
covered by a classified thickness of nickel or aluminium armor (That's right, 
Aluminium in an alloy form with other metals).  The trailers are rigged with 
nozzles that will envelop a terrorist who manages to open the doors with a 
mountain of fast-hardening urea (insulating) foam, suffocating him and hiding 
the warhead/Plutonium with a thick coat of the stuff. 
  
                               Forget it. 
  The condition of each truck on the road is updated by couriers every 15 
minutes by Shortwave to the Command Post in NM.  The transmissions are in 
encrypted digital bursts on 11.555, 7.700 and 3.335 MHz, USB.  Rarely you 
can hear the base speak with a Courier.  Intra-convoy communications are 
handled with low-power VHF radios on 164.375 and 164.225 MHz.  They were 
duped by those shitheads at Motorola into buying Digital Voice protection, 
a scrambling system.  Granted, you can't understand what they're saying 
(probably stuff like "Wanna eat at Denny's or go to the Truck Stop?"). 
Basic SIGINT still tells you that prescence of ANY transmissions means a 
convoy is close.  Listen for what sounds like a squelch burst and a tone 
at the end, that's the DVP. 
  If a trouble signal is transmitted to the CP, a number of things happen. 
First, the dispatcher attempts to reach the convoy by SW to find the nature 
of the problem; accident, out of beer, or terrorist atta#k. The first re- 
sponse will bring out an EOD team from the nearest Army base and added 
Albuquerque.  They contact the respective State Police agency for local 
coordination. In case of attack, I can't really say what will hn be- 
cause I don't know.  Speculating, I believe the Army's response will be much 
greater.  Instead of MP's, combat troops will be airlifted along with the 
Decon. and Emergency Ordnance Disposal troops.  State police will also flood 
the area and seal if off, with local units merely handling roadblocks at 
the perimeters.  Any non-authorized (non-government) aircraft passing near 
the area will be either escorted out by the TAC, or be downed.  This includes 
news media choppers.  NEST (Nuclear Emergency Search Team) will be called at 
once to aid in locating possibly contaminated areas and assist in finding any 
missing fissionable material.  If an intact warhead is found to be missing, 
a national state of emergency will be declared until the situation is re- 
solved.  This means a callup of National Guard and the Reserves, as well as 
placing all active military personnel on full alert.  It also means that 
various civil rights will be curtailed and c sehis is soe 
siou shit. TheNational Emrgny omand Alet Post (NECP, a.k.a

  The terrorists wouldn't have a chance in hell.  Detonating a bomb would

(e.g. FALN, M-19, Animal rights and splinter anti-abortion factions) and 
Intelligence (CIA and DOE) created groups would claim responsibility so 
the organizations would see how unproductive pulling such a stunt would 
be in the future - no exclusive media attention means no gain. 
  
Note to any Federal agency who gets hold of this.  I want to work for 
DOE intelligence.  All of this is put together from unclassified sources. 
If it's good enough to get me in trouble, wouldn't you agree I'd be good 
to have working for your organization??  Think of this as a Resume. 
You know how to get hold of me, I'm sure.
