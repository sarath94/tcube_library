Automotive Locking Systems
--------------------------
 
     Automotive locks vary considerably in the types
of locking mechanisms and lock arrangements.  There are
many other methods of gaining access to an automobile
which are quite often quicker and easier than attempting
to pick the lock.
     Probably the most common point of entry is the wing
or vent window, or, in the newer models, the rubber
molding.  Anyone intending to engage in automobile lock
work (or desiring to save approximately fifty dollars or
more in service calls) will need some special tools.
Both the curve and length of tools are important to their
overall effectiveness.
     The tool being used should first be lubricated with
a glycerine-based hand lotion or hand cleaner before
inserting it through the weatherstripping.  This not only
makes the tools work easier, but helps prevent scarring,
tearing or any other damage to the weatherstripping.
     To open most front wing windows, take the lever 
latch tool and insert it through the weatherstripping
between the wing window and the window trim.  Manipulate
the tool by controlling the depth of penetration along
the curve.  At the same time use a rocking action to
move the window lock into the unlocked position.
     One other type of wing window lock has a lever latch
equipped with a plunger at the pivot of the latch. The
plunger deadlocks the latch against rotation, unless the
plunger is first pushed in and held until the initial
stage of rotation has been accomplished.  This requires
that another tool be inserted through the weatherstripping
and the door window to depress the plunger and hold it
in that position while the other tool is used to rotate
the latch.  Normally, the tool used for depressing the
deadlocking plunger has a slight curve at the tip.  The
tool's only purpose is to depress the plunger.
     Another means of access, when the door window is
fully raised and the door is locked, consists of inserting
a stiff bent wire, and using it directly on the locking
mechanism.  Tripping of the lock mechanism may often be
done by pulling up on the wire once the tip of the wire
has been positioned under the lock linkage.  At other
times, the bent tip of the wire must be pulled up against
the linkage and then rotated to trip the locking mechanism.
With practice one gets the feel of what is required to
open the door.
     Automobiles using a rocker type of locking mechanism
may be tripped by using a thin piece of flat spring
steel stock.  First, coat the tool with a glycerine-based
hand lotion or hand cleaner to protect the trim and
rubber molding.  Insert the tool next to the glass
or between the weatherstripping/molding and the metal
of the door.   Feel for the lock linkage with the notched
end of the tool, then move the linkage up and down until
the lock moves into the unlocked position.
     Another avenue of access to most automobiles is
through the firewall, reaching the door locks with a long
stiff wire to push the lock button into the unlocked
position.
     Since automobile door locks on most newer models are
normally held in place by a retainer clip, as a last 
resort the lock can be punched out.  First, insert a
bent piece of wire into the keyway and bind it to prevent
the lock mechanism from falling into the door frame.
Once out, the automobile can be opened by pushing up
on the linkage attached to the lock mechanism.
