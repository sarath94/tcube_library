        The potato cannon is a fun device which is constructed of common
materials that can be obtained at almost any hardware store. It uses a
common "fuel" and can shoot a potato over 1000 feet. It is not, however, at
toy. It can almost be considered a firearm. Therefore it should be treated
with respect. It should be used by minors only under strict adult
supervision. Always wear protective clothing which is available.

   Now that the actual gun is constructed, it is time for the most
   important part of the gun. The ignition system. There is alternative
   ignition systems available, but this piezo system is easy to construct,
   and is therefore recommended. Any HV source will do, but as always piezo
   is the smallest and safest. The most important part of the ignition
   construction process is the correct spark gap. It must be as long as
   possible, yet it must spark every time. It should be tested before ANY
   fuel is introduced into the chamber.

V:   Ignition system

     A Hardware

       1. Piezo ignitor             (Number 7 on the I:A list)
       2. 2 1/2 inch machine screws (Number 8)
       3. Drill
       4. 1/8 inch drill bit
       5. Screwdriver
       6. 18 gauge wire

     B Construction

       1. Run a length of wire, one from each terminal. Use electrical tape
          to hold in place.
       2. In the center of the chamber drill a 1/8 inch hole. Opposite that
          hole, drill another hole.
       3. In each hole, drive a screw.
       4. Drive the screws until they meet in the center with approximately
          a 1/4 inch gap.
       5. Solder each wire to the screws.
       6. Test the ignition system, and adjust screws accordingly.

   Now that the gun is completely built, it is time to load the projectile,
   and fuel the chamber. Care must be taken when fueling the chamber. Be
   positive that there are no flames left in the chamber before spraying
   fuel. Do NOT depress the ignition button while refueling.

VI:  Loading

     A Projectile Forming

       Your projectiles should be pre-formed for convenience and to also
       keep build-up to a minimum. To make the projectiles, cut a length
       (about eight inches) of one inch pipe. Firmly press the pipe into a
       potato. Push the pieces out with a smaller diameter piece of pipe,
       or a broom handle. After removing the pieces from the pipe, keep
       them stored in water to keep them from drying out.

     B Loading The Cannon

       To load the cannon, take one of the pre-cut projectiles, insert it
       into the top of the barrel. With a broom handle, push the potato to
       just above the chamber. Be cautious not to push the potato in too
       far into the barrel.

   The gun is now loaded and ready to fire. Before you can fire the gun, we
   must first discuss the fuel. The fuel found to be the most efficient is
   diethyl ether, which is bought under the pretense of starting fluid.

VII: Fueling/Firing

     To fuel the gun you must first remove the cleanout plug. Then, spray
     the fuel into the chamber for approximately half a second, if not
     less. You need to experiment a little here to find the exact fuel/air
     mixture needed for your particular gun. After spraying the fuel,
     quickly replace the plug, and make sure it is on good and tight. Aim
     the gun, depress the ignition switch, and HOLD ON!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Helpful Hints:

* The barrel may be turned down on a lathe in order to achieve greater
  accuracy, it will also cut the potato easier thus creating less a mess.

* Be sure not to spray too much fuel into the camber. This will cause
  improper ignition and can damage the gun permanently.

* Do not allow anyone to stand directly behind the gun while firing as the
  plug may blow off and create serious injuries.

* The potato cannon is not limited to potatoes alone. Pears, apples and
  almost any other fruit or vegetable can be used. Think about it, the
  possibilities are endless.

* Ether is not the only fuel that can be used in the cannon. The original
  potato cannon used HAIRSPRAY! This was found to cause build-up and
  premature ignition fouling.

* Please note that the finer the fuel mist, the better the gun will
  perform.

You may also imagine a piezo ignitor, and two leads from it to the both
screws, it was too hard to draw them in ASCII. (The drawing is not to
scale, as you probably understand).

Have fun with this device, and don't aim at innocent people...
