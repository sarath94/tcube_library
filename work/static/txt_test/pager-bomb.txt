HOW TO MAKE A PAGER BOMB!!

-Materials
Pager[beeper]
wire cutters
igniter fuse {I will explain this later}
Explosives
screw driver
-Procedure

-Take the screw driver and unscrew the screws on the pager
then open it up carefuly so not to cut any wires you shouldn't.

-now this is the HARD part you must locate the speeker and there should
be two wires green,red,yellow,black what ever color doesn't matter!
cut the wires as close to the speeker as you can so you have slack.
now you need to strip the cover off the wire so you can use the wire!

-take an igniter and attach each end to one of the wires so it look's
somewhat like this!!

              |BULB END OF IGNITER
             / \IGNITER                                                 
            /   \
           <     >CONETION SPOT
           |     |
           |     |WIRE LEADING TO CIRCUTBOARD

-OK if you have done this right you are all set just atach the 
Explosives to the BULB END of the igniter and it will work!!
IT WORK"S GOOD WITH C-4 or gunpowder!!

-OK NOW THE IGNITER IS ONE YOU USE WITH A MODLE ROCKET ENGIN TO LIFT
IT OFF THE WIRE THING"S IN THE PACKAGE. WHEN YOU BUY A PACK OF THE
ENGIN'S IT SOMETIMES OR MOST TIMES COME"S WITH THEM!! OR YOU CAN
BUY THEM ALONE IN A PACK FOR $2.50 OR SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE!

So have Phunnn...

P.S. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T AS SMART YOU SHOULD TRY SCREWING IT 
BACK TO GEATHER ONCE YOUR DONE!![incase all of you out there didn't 
know]

::NOTE::I DO NOT SUGGEST TRYING THIS AT HOME AND DONT BLAME ME IF YOU
FUCK THE BEEPER UP!!!!
