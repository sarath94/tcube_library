The growing world of household weapons
would not be complete without the 
infamous PEN GUN. This versatile weapon
which doubles as a household pen, can
be shot up to 2 feet and still do sub
stantial damage to the enemies' eyes
or what not.

STEP 1: acquire a "push pen", one that
snaps in and out when you press the 
back of the pen.

STEP 2: next, disassemble this pen so that you have the 4 parts needed to fire
your semi-automatic weapon.

1> the pusher (found in the back)
2> the little pusher (found in the pusher)
3> the spring (found on top of the ink case)
4> the ink case (the long thing with ink in it)

Once you have discovered these parts.
arrange them in such a way so that you
can see each of the parts.

STEP 4: now, you must follow these 
instructions closely.

1> put the pusher in it's old place. 
be sure not to put the little pusher in
it!
2> put the spring in next (all this goes in the back of the pen)
3> on top of the spring goes the little
pusher. 
4> put the ink case on top of the little
pusher and replace the front. (this
cram all of the little parts together
and make them stick in there.
5> remove the top. and leave the ink case
in, as this will be the pain inflicting
element.

To activate this little gun, just push
the pusher! (some extra force may be
required)

This little weapon/writing utensil, can
be used to write a paper or blind an
enemy! It's also good for shooting the
person in front of you in class (be 
sure he's wearing thick clothes unless
you want to hurt him)

Enjoy!
