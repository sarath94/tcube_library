Today's Lesson: Acetone peroxide explosive.

  Acetone peroxide is a primary explosive that can be made from hair bleach
(hydrogen peroxide), acetone, and sulfuric acid. This explosive is to be used
in the fabrication of detonators
(Section VI, No. 13, Vol. 2).

MATERIAL REQUIRED:                      SOURCES:
------------------                      --------
Hydrogen peroxide                       Hair bleach (15-25 volume content)
                                        Drug stores and hair supply stores

Acetone                                 Clear battery acid boiled until fumes
                                        appear

Eye dropper or syringe with glass tube

Graduated cylinder (cc or ml) or other
measuring device

Thermometer (0 to 100 degrees C.)

Glass containers

Large pan

Ice and salt

Water

Paper Towels


Procedure:

1. Measure 30 ml of acetone and 50 ml of  hydrogen peroxide into a glass
container and mix thoroughly.
2. Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture by placing it's container in a larger one
containing a mixturre of ice, salt, and water.
Note: Because of the lighter inner container being buoyant in the larger outer
container, it is necessary to secure it so that it won't faall over into the
ice, salt, and water mixture.
3. Cool the mixture to 5 degrees C.
4. Add 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the mixture slowly, drop by
drop, with the use of an eye dropper. Stir the mixture during the addition of
the sulfuric acid with a thermometer, keeping the temperature between 5-10
degrrees C. Should the temp. rise above 10 degrees C., stop adding the acid
and continue stirring until the temp. drops again to 5 degrees C., then
continue adding the acid.
5. After all the acid has been added, continue stirring the mixture for another
five minutes.
6. Let the new mixture stand in the Ice/Salt/Water bath or remove the inner
container and place it inn an ice box for 12 to 24 hrs.
7. After 12 hours white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of
the once clear solution. Precipitation should be completed after 24 hrs.
Caution: At this point the mixture is a primary explosive. Keep away from
shock, friction or flame.
8. Filter the mixture through a paper towel into a container to collect the
solid particles.
9. Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with small amounts of
ice cold water poured over them. Discard the liquid in the container.
10. Place these explosive crystals in a container and allow to dry.

Use within 10 days and store in cool, drry, and dark place.
