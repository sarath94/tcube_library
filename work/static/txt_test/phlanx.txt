  BLOCK 1:   Has improved radar with four-plate back-to-back search array for 
  high-elevation coverage, greater ammunition stowage, higher rate of fire, and 
  enhanced reliability and maintainability. Authorization for limited production 
  in 1986 
           
  ISSUES:  The installation of Phalanx CIWS came several years after the 
  appearance of similar rapid-fire gun systems of larger caliber, in Soviet 
  surface warships.  Most foreign CIWS designs include 25-mm or 30-mm rapid- 
  fire gun rather than the smaller 20-mm of the Phalanx.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:  
  The CIWS on the USS STARK (FFG31) did not engage the French-Built Exocet 
  AM-39 air-to-surface missiles launched against the ship by an Iraqi aircraft
  on 17 May 1987. In Senate Hearings before the Committee on Appropriations 
  for FY1986, US Department of Defense officials were asked about the 
  effectiveness of the CIWS against Exocet missiles, to which they replied, 
  "In Recent operational tests, PHALANX destroyed numerous EXOCETS in an 
  imparessive4 fashion."
