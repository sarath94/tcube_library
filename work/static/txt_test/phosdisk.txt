     The Sysops, Co-Sysops, or owners of The Fonefactory BBS, are in no
way responsible for the illegal or wrongful use of this information, and
it is not recomended nor encouraged that a project such as this be
attempted.  Any consequence related to this information is the sole
responsibility of the person or persons who carried out this project, and
therefore any self-inflicted injuries, or injuries to others are their
responsibility.  Again, we state, DO NOT ATTEMP THIS PROJECT!  It is
extremely hazardous, and discouraged.  However, our constitution allows

     The following is intended for information only, and, should never be
attempted.  This document describes a technique for making a phosphorous
diskette.  It is based on the same principals as a match, and therefore,
your local library will have any added information you need for the ratios
of the chemicals, or other chemicals needed to increase performance.  This
diskette, when placed into a diskette drive, will ignite, due to friction
with the wheels, causing the computer to go up in flames.


Materials:

5 1/4 inch diskette
Sulfide of phosphorous, P(4)S(3)
Potassium chlorate, KClO(3)
Powdered glass
Glue



Procedure:

     Remove the diskette from its jacket, by carefully opening the seams
on the edges.  Once removed, set the diskette aside.  Mix the sulfide
of phosphorous, the potassium chlorate, and the powdered glass.  Spread
the glue into a thin layer all over the diskette, it must be thin, or
the diskette will be suspected.  While the thin layer of glue is still
tacky, sprinkle the mixture all over the diskette, being careful not to
touch the mixture with your bare hands because it will cut you.  This type
of a cut is very painful.  When the diskette is dry, insert it back into
the jacket, and glue it in so that it won't turn.  Reseal the jacket with
glue.  You now have a phosphorous diskette.



Suppliers:

     You can get the chemicals at a school chem lab, or a
chemistry supply shop which supplies schools with their chemicals.
The diskette can be bought at a store, of course.



One final note:

     The diskette described will do considerable damage to a computer
system.  If it fails to ignite, adjust the amounts of chemicals used.
Start out with the chemicals at a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio.  For added
performance, gunpowder can be sprinkeled as well on the diskette.  That
is for real fireworks!
