Here'sa toy that will have limited use for most people now, but which might
encourage a bit more sneakiness in the future.  It's a simple device that
allowsyou to quickly and silently open, with no injury to yourself or the
target,virtually any briefcase that uses a combination lock as its sole
security measure.

|__________________________|    that nerdy kid in your homeroom with the
  ^^^   ^^^^^^^^^    ^^        hornrim glasses and the pencil case in his
 Slide Combo Dials  Hasp       shirt pocket.  You never know what he might
                               have hidden in there . . . like a nice HP
calculator (which he never uses -- he extracts cube roots in his head) or his
lunchmoney.  Now you can find out without him knowing.  Just snatch the case
fromhis locker, where he keeps it during Gym period, and be sure to put it
backbefore he returns.  (And if you don't know how to get into his locker,
checkout the Master Lock file in PHRACK issue #1.)

Building Mister Shim(TM)
------------------------

You'llneed a thin piece of metal about 2cm by 3cm.  (We're using metric here,
guys. So sue me.)  In the one I made I used a piece cut from an aluminum Coke
canand it worked fine.  Out of the 2cm end, cut it to look like the diagram
below(which I wish could be less confusing . . . just look at it carefully).

                   (To SCALE? Are you KIDDING?)

Itlookstough, but really isn't . . . use a very sharp exacto knife to cut out
thetwo corners first, then a fine trangular metal file to smooth it and file
outthe small indentations.  It'll take about ten to fifteen minutes if you do
itcarefully, and it does NOT have to be EXACT . . . just get it as close as
youcan.  It helps to have one of those locks nearby to fine-tune the shim.
Simplyset the lock to its correct combiation and insert Mister Shim(TM) as
described below.  If it works as described, your shim is properly designed.

UsingMister Shim(TM)
---------------------

Theguywho designed this particular type of lock knew that he'd have to
installsome sort of "back door" in it, for all those airheads who would change
thenumbers on their locks and then forget them, or in case Random Briefcase
Vandalsassaulted the luggage store, raping, pillaging, and changing
combinations as they went.  This is that back door.

Useissimple.  Slide the modified end of Mister Shim(TM) into the gap right
t to the dial on the lock.  (Try both sides, it varies from lock to lock.)
IfMister Shim(TM) goes in ALL THE WAY with a little jiggling, the number shown
onthe dial is correct.  If not, turn to the next number and try again.  On a
three-dial lock, it will take an average of only fifteen checks to find the
propercombination; on a two-lock case with a practiced operator, this adds up
toLESS THAN A MINUTE to open the case.

Youcannow access anything inside the case you like, or change the combination
ifyou wish.  (To change the combination, push the slide towards the hasp [see
firstdiagram] and hold it, then turn the dials to the desired new combo.  Your
victimwill have to go to someone with their own Mister Shim(TM) -- or destroy
thelock -- if they ever want to get into their briefcase again.)

UseMisterShim(TM) in good health.
