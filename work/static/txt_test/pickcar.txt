Getting in Cars the Easy Way
----------------------------
Needed: One Bag, 2 people.
 
Now this is as easy as it gets, just go around pulling on door handles, and see 
who's a stupid ass to leave there door unlocked.  Where we hit, it was over half 
the cars we tried!  And before you open doors on a sharp looking car (Camaro,
Porshe, Iroc-Z, ect.) look on the outside of the car for extra locks (to 
lock/unlock the alarm).
 
And if you see a blinking light by the dash board (looking through the window) 
don't open it, unless you wanna open it and run (Fer fun ya know!).  I guess 
that's all?!?  ok now to the next chapter.
 
Getting into Cars The More Advanced Way...
Needed Onle long thin piece of Metal, Or a Very strong Knife.
1 Coat Hanger
2 People.
 
   Well we all now if you have somthing Valuable in the car you may lock it up, 
Unless your a Dumb ass, Anyway then this is why advanced knowledge is needed 
to be known about the system in which cars lock,
 
(The Lock)
Well You dont need to know every thing about the lock (It could help But I'm 
in no postion to tell you but I can help you in getting in) Simply put to unlock 
a door you only have to lift a little bar with in the door.
 
Procedure
---------
 
   Ok, Take the coat hanger and just bend the hanger together so it is a long it
looks like so:
                                          ###### 
                                               #
                                               #
                                               #
          ######################################                            
 
 
 Ok then once you at the car take the piece of metal and seperate the rubber 
from the window and then slide the coat hanger in.  The object is to get the coat 
hanger's curl under the bar and then lift up to unlock the car Get it???  The 
bar is usally located right about 8 inches under the Lock Button.
 
 
Where to look and What to get.
------------------------------
  Well once in the car you want to search for these items..
 
(1) Radio-- Not hard to Find you would be surprised what pawnn shops Pay...
 
(2) Money-- Any kind of money helps search for Wallets coin Purses and etc, 
Believe me in one night I got about 20 Dollars in Change.   Search between seats 
and In golve Compartment or somtimes there is space under the Radio.
 
(3) Keys-- Alot of people Leave there Phucking Keys in the car so
if you find them Phucking go, Me and Cracka once phucking went in a Ferrari.  Or 
they maybe house keys and you then can expand your
capabilities...
 
(4) Carbon Copys-- Yes they are here too.  Alot of people go Shopping they 
somtimes leave there Carbons in the car.
 
(5) Anything-- Believe me once your in Take any Phucking thing you want!!!!!

A little Pink Button ( I Dont know how we got it )
---------------------How to steal a Car.
 
 
 First you need to get into the car.   The easiest atest way is
to use a device that all the towing companies use in case you locked
your keys in your car.   Well here is the design for it.   Make it out
of sheet metal or just use a metal ruler about an inch by 2 feet and
make it as close as you can to the diagram.
 
 
              
              
       _      
         \     
          \    
           \   
           /   
        __/   /
            /
            \_
              
              
       _______
 
 
 Once you have contructed this thing, stick it into the side of the door
(between the window and the door) and feel for a pin inside.   Once you
have found it, push down slowly and the pull up fast and it should work.
It make take some practice, but you will get it eventually.
Yes, we have all the seen the movies and how those bad guys can easily
duck under the dashboard and two seconds later have the car started.   Is
this possible?   Yes it is, just it takes quite a bit of practice to
get as good as they.
 
 Each car has it's own wiring system, so each car is different and you
should know the car's wiring system before you try to hot-wire.   You
can get car manuals which show the whole wiring system.   You should be
looking for two wires that have some connection with the ignition switch.
t(Usually on older cars they are two red ones.   These are the ones to cross
over.   It make take some looking to find these wires, and you might need
to experiment on the car, which may cause some damage if you cross over
two wrong wires and short out the electrical system.
 
 If you totally questioned about where to start under the dashboard, then go
for the ignition and cross all the wires that have to do with that.   Eventually
you will get a pair of wires that will start the car.   What you are basically
doing is trying to bypass the ignition switch.   The easiest cars to
hot-wire are the older ones, but they are not worth as much.

American combination locks, hairpins as picks.

  Ok, so ya say ya want to learn how to pick combination locks...This text file
should help you.   As a matter of fact, if ya do it right, it will help yo, there is a curved piece metal wedged inside the little notch on the
horseshoe shaped bar that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.   To free
this wedge, you must(must is a word used to much) you usually(that sounds much
better) have to turn the lock to the desired combination and the pressure on
the wedge is released therefore letting the lock open.I will now tell you how
to make a pick so you can open a lock without having to waste all that time
turning the combination (this also helps when ya don't know the combination to
begin with).   First of all, ya need to find a hairpin.What's a hairpin?
Well, just ask your mom.   She will have one.   If she asks what its for, say ya
have to hold something together...   If she says use a rubberband or use a
paper clip, tell her to fuck off and die and then go to the store and rip off a
box of 50 or so.   Ok, enough stalling (yea, i was stalling).   Once you have
your hair pin (make su its metal), take the ridged side and break it off
right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight side.   The curved
part t can now be used as a handle.   Now, using a file, file down the other end
until it is fairly thin.   You should do this to many hairpins and file them so
they are of different thicknesses so you can pick various locks.   Some locks
are so cheap that ya don't even have to file!   But most are not.   Ok, now you
have a lock pick.   Now if ya haven't figured it out, here's how ya use it.   You
look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.   If you can't tell, you
will just have to try both sides.   When ya find out what side it opens from, ,
take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the horseshoe-
shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.   Now, put pressure on the
handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the crack) and pull the lock up and
down.   The lock will then open because the pick separated the wedge and the
notch allowing us thieves to open it.   Don't say bullshit until you've tried
it.   because i have gotten lots of beer money from doing' this to fellow
students' gym lockers.   Also, this technique works best on American locks.   I
have never picked a Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the
wedge but if anyone does it, let me know how long it took.   Also, the Master
lock casing is very tight so ya can't get the pick in.   So, if you're locking
something valuable up, use a Master, because at least ya know I won't be
picking it
and I'm sure there aren't that many that could.   And when i say pick, i don't
mean lighting a stick of dynamite next to the lock, picking is opening a lock
without t using force, making a substitute key, etc.

+                                 Lock Picking -pin and tumbler doorknobs                             
Lock picking does NOT just take 15 seconds.  Even experienced locksmiths can
spend up to 5 to 10 minutes on a lock.

THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN MOSTLY TO THE "LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE LOCK,
SINCE IT'S THE EASIEST TO PICK.

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET.  IF YOU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE YOU
A SET.  THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE.  IF YOU FIND A
LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T GIVE UP HOPE.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
YOUR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A GRINDER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT IT TAKES
FOREVER.)

THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH SET.  THESE SHOULD BE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT
INTO THE KEYHOLE SLOT.  NOW, BEND THE LONG END OF THE ALLEN WRENCH AT A SLIGHT
ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.) IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

#1     \
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\         (THIS IS THE HANDLE
                                           \\        THAT WAS ALREADY
                                           \\        (HERE.)
                                           \
                                           \
                                           \

NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A FILE AND SMOOTH THE END (#1) UNTIL IT'S
ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HANG INDE THE LOCK.   TEST YOUR TOOL OUT ON DOORKNOBS AT
YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF IT WILL SLIDE IN AND OUT SMOOTHLY.

NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.  IS IT SMALL ENOUGH FOR IT AND YOUR
PICK TO BE USED IN THE SAME LOCK AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ABOVE THE OTHER.

IN THE COMING INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE REFER TO THIS CHART OF THE INTERIOR OF A
LOCK:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX K
 #  #  #  #   #   #     E
    #     #   #   #     Y
 *     *                H
 *  *  *  *   *   *     O
                        L
                        E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#= UPPER TUMLER PIN
*= LOWER TUMLER PIN
X= CYLINDER WALL

(THIS IS A GREATLY SIMPLIFIED DRAWING)

THE OBJECT IS TO PRESS THE PIN UP SO THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE UPPER PIN AND
THE LOWER PIN IS LEVEL WITH THE CYLINDER WALL.  NOW, IF YOU PUSH A PIN UP, ITS
TENDANCY IS TO FALL BACK DOWN.  THAT IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.   INSERT
THE SCREWDRIVER INTO THE SLOT AND TURN.  THIS TENSION WILL KEEP THE "SOLVED" PINS
FROM FALLING BACK DOWN.  NOW, WORK FROM THE BACK OF THE LOCK TO THE FRONT, AND
WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH.....

THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE SCREWDRIVER WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN.
DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON YOUR FIRST TRY!  IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT 20-30
MINUTES YOUR FIRST TIME.  AFTER THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE.

THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF ENTERING A HOUSE.
                              VENDING MACHINE KEYS

This worked for a friend of mine at school (I would never do anything like this)
it got him over $900 in one day.

Here's how to do it:

On almost all vending machines they have those damn round almost unpickable.

When no one is looking quickly press a piece of AIR-HARDENING clay into the
lock.   (Press hard enough to get a good impression.)

Remove the clay carefully and let it dry for however long the clay has to dry as
specified on the package.

You now have a key to fit that lock, (this Type of 'key' can be easily crushed
if you're seen.   But if you're smart you won't though)
************************************

IN ORDER TO PICK A PIN TUMBLER LOCK,
YOU WILL REQUIRE FOUR ITEMS: A LOCK,
YOU, A PICK, AND A TENSION WRENCH.  YOU
CAN USSUALLY GET THESE AT A LOCKSMITH
STORE, IF YOU CAN NOT FIND ONE NEAR YOU
THERE WILL BE AN ADDRESS AT THE END OF
THE ARTICLE THAT YOU CAN ORDER THEM
FROM.  HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF A PICK
AND A TENSION WRENCH:

      PICK         TENSION WRENCH

MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THE NEED FOR THE
PICK, BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE WRENCH
IS FOR.   IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WITH-
OUT IT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK
A LOCK.

IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK, WE MUST COUNT
UPON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE LOCK.
BEFORE WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACTUALLY PICK
THE LOCK, WE WILL LOOK AT THE PARTS OF
IT AND HOW THE IMPERFECTION PART FITS
IN.   HERE IS A DISSASSEMBLED LOCK:

    \__/-------------------  <- KEY


WHEN YOU INSERT A KEY INTO A LOCK, THE
BOTTEM PINS ARE PUSHED UP, AND IF IT
IS THE PROPER KEY, THE TOPS OF THE
BOTTOM PINS WILL MATCH WITH THE SPOT 
WHERE THE PLUG AND HOUSING MEET, THUS
ALLOWING YOU TO TURN THE PLUG, AND OPEN
THE DOOR, ETC..  WHEN YOU INSER THE KEY,
THE BOTTOM PINS GO INTO THE VALLEYS OF
THE KEY, THUS MEANING THAT THE KEY MUST
HAVE THE RIGHT HEIGHT VALLEYS TO MAKE
THE LOCK OPEN.  PRETTY ELEMENTRY, RIGHT?
WELL NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO HOW TO PICK
A LOCK.

IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK WE (AS I SAID
BEFORE) DEPEND ON THE INACCURACY OF THE
MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  THE FIRST THING
TO DO IS TO INSERT THE TENSION WRENCH
INTO THE LOCK AND APPLY A SLIGHT 
PRESSURE TO THE LEFT (OR RIGHT IF YOU
WISH) SO THAT IF YOU COULD LOOK INSIDE
THE LOCK AT WHERE THE PLUG AND THE
HOUSING WOULD MEET, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
THIS:

               !  !*!  !
     HOUSING   !  !*!  !
               !  !*!  !
     __________!  !*!  !___________
     __________  !*!  ____________
              !   !*!!
     PLUG     !   !_!!
              !    _ !
              !   !*!!
              !   \_/!

NOW A SLIGHT PRESURE IS ON THE PINS.
BECAUSE THE PINS CAN NOT BE PRODUCED
EXACTLY THE SAME, THERE IS ONE PIN
WHICH IS THE WIDEST AND THERE FORE HAS
MORE TENSION ON IT, AND ONE WHICH IS
THE THINNEST AND HAS ALMOST NO PRESSURE
ON IT.  WE NOW USE THE PICK TO >GENTLY<
PUSH EACH PIN UP (AND TRY TO FEEL IT 
WHEN YOU LET IT DOWN) UNTIL WE FIND
WHICH IS THE TIGHTEST ON AND WHICH IS
LOOSEST.  GETTING THE FEEL FOR THIS IS
THE HARDEST PART OF LOCK PICKING.  NOW
THAT YOU HAVE FOUND THE LOOSEST ONE,
GENTLY PRESS IT UPWARD UNTIL YOU FEEL
A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN TENSION ON THE
TENSION WRENCH.  THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN
THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM PIN BECOMES
EVEN WITH THE JUNCTION OF THE PLUG AND
THE HOUSING.  DO NOT RELEASE ANY TENSION
FROM THE WRENCH NOW!  THE DRIVER WILL
NOW BE TRAPPED IN THE HOUSING AS
ILLUSTRATED HERE: (DON'T I DRAW PRETTY)

            !  !*!  !
   HOUSING  !  !*!  !
            !  !*!  !
 ___________!  !_!  !___________
 _______________     ___________
               !  !*!  !
    PLUG       !  !*!  !
               !  \_/ !
               !      !

NOW YOU CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WITH EACH
OF THE PINS UNTIL YOU WORK YOUR WAY UP
TO THE ONE THAT IS WIDEST.  WITH SOME
PRACTICE Y CAN GET FAIRLY FAST AT
THIS.  I SUGGEST PRACTICING ON A FOUR
PIN TUMBLER LOCK THAT IS BOUGHT FROM A
HARDWARE STORE, THE CHEAPER THE BETTER.

I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS A PATICULAR
CONFIGURATION OF THE PINS NOW THAT MAY
PRESENT A PARTICULARLY HARD JOB TO 
PICK.  THIS IS GRAPHICLY SHOWN HERE BY
THE TWO MIDDLE PINS:

        !*!  !*!  !*!  !*!
        !*!  !*!  !_!  !*!
        !*!  !*!   _  !*!
        !_!  !*!  !*!  !_!
         _  !*!  !*!   _
        !*!  !*!  !*!  !*!
        !*!  !_!  !*!  !*!
        !*!   _  !*!  !*!
        !*!  !*!  !*!  !*!
        \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/

             \_______________

WHEN YOU TRY TO PUSH THE 2ND PIN FROM
THE LEFT UP, YOU WILL UNAVOIDABLY BE
PUSHING THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT UP BE-
CAUSE OF IT'S LONG BOTTOM PIN.  THE ONLY
SOLUTION FOR THIS IS TO GET A SPECIAL
PICK THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:

         
          \   _______________
           \_/

THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT IT
IS HARD TO INITIALLY DETECT.  THE REASON
THAT IT MAKES IT HARDER IF IT IS NOT 
IMMEDIETLY APPERANT IS THAT YOU UN-
AVOIDABLY PUSH THE 3RD PIN FROM THE
LEFT UP INTO THE HOUSING, GETTING IT
JAMMED:

             !  !*!  !
   HOUSING   !  !_!  !
             !   _  !
             !  !*!  !
   __________!  !*!  !________
   ___________ !*!  ________
              !!*!!    
     PLUG     !!*!!
              !\_/!


I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A 
TECHNIQUE CALLED RAKING.  IT USES A
TOOL LIKE THIS:

        \/\/\/\___________

BASICLY YOU "RAKE" IT BACK AND FORTH
ACROSS THE PINS, HOPING THAT COMBINED
WITH THE TENSION IT WILL GIVE YOU THE
RIGHT COMBINATION.  THIS WAY HAS BEEN
KNOWN: FAST SOMETIMES, BUT IS
NOT VERY RELIABLE, AND I WOULD SUGGEST
LEARNING TO ACTUALLY "PICK" THE LOCK.

YES WE ARE ABLE TO ENTER AND EXIT A ROOM WITHOUT A LARGE TRACE...IF YOU KNOW
HOW JAPANESE HOUSES IN THE ANCIENT TIMES WERE BUILT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE
SUPPORT POSTS, THEY USUALLY HAVE GRAPPLING HOOK MARKS IF A NINJA HAD WALKED
THRU THE ROOM TO KILL A PERSON OR SOMETHING.   BUT ONE HAS TO LOOK VERY, VERY
CAREFULLY.
 
HOW TO PICK FILE CABINET LOCKS:
-------------------------------
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE TO PICK OPEN A FILE CABINET.   MOST FILE CABINETS NOWADAYS
HAVE A CHEAP DISK TUMBLING SYSTEM.   IF THE DISK PATTERNS MAH THE KEY SHAPE,
PRESTO!   IT'S OPEN.

More (Y/N/C)?_____________             _____________WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR KEY, JUST INSERT IT ALL THE WIN.   JERK IT UP AND DOWN
AS FAST AS YOU CAN, AS YOU TURN THE KEY TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT, DEPENDING ON
HOW THE LOCK OPENS.   IF YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN
ANY FILE CABINET LOCK IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.   I USUALLY TAKE ABOUT 3 TO 5
SECONDS WITH MY KEY.
 
 
OPENING LOCKED DOORS:
---------------------
I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN TEACHING HOW TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS.   I'LL TELL YOU
THE MOST BASIC WAY OF DOING IT.   THIS TECHNIQUE HAS TO BE A DOOR WITH A GAP
AS WIDE AS A WIDTH OF A BUTTER KNIFE.
 
IF YOU HAVE A BUTTER KNIFE OR A BUTTER FLY KNIFE OR EQUIVALENT, HANDY, YOU CAN
OPEN THESE KINDA DOORS AS THOUGH YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THEM.
 
           DOOR GAP
              
              
             -
              ---- THE SO CALLED "BOLT" OF THE DOOR.
              
             -
              
              
              
 
      BIRD'S EYE AND ENLARGED VIEW OF THIS
 
 
 
              ----------  THE KNIFE
              v
              I            ---- SLIDE THE KNIFE THIS WAY FOR THIS PICTURE
         ____ I   ______
             I _

         ____   _______
               ^
               --------------- THE "BOLT"
 
 
IF THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACES YOU THEN WITH THE KNIFE, PUSH ON THE
BOLT WITH THE BACK OF THE BLADE.   AS YOU PUSH, SLIDE THE KNIFE TOWARDS THE
SIDE OF THE DOOR.  (SEE ILLUSTATION FOR CLARITY).   YOU WILL SLOWLY MOVE IT.
AND PRESTO!   THE DOOR IS OPEN.   THE TRICK IS TO SLIDE THE KNIFE AND PUSHING
IT AT THE SAME TIME, AND HOLD ON TO THE DOOR KNOB.  IF IT OPENS INWARDS, GET
READY TO PUSH IT AS SOON AS THE KNIFE IS THRU THE "BOLT".
 
FOR THE OTHER CASE ( THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACING AWAY FROM YOU ),
YOU JUST PULL ON THE KNIFE AND GIVE THE SAME SLIDING MOTION.   BE CAREFUL
NOT TO STAB YOURSELF.   THE KNIFE'SONTACT POINT IS ALWAYS THE BACK OF THE
KNIFE.
 
HOW TO PICK 5 PIN CIRCULAR TUMBLER LOCKS:
-----------------------------------------
THIS IS VERY HARD...IT TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE TO CRACK OPEN THESE KINDS OF
LOCKS.   MOST BIKE LOCKS AND ARCADE COIN SLOT LOCKS HAVE THIS TYPE OF LOCK.
 
LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT 5 PIN CIRCULAR TUMBLERS ARE...
               ___                 --=_________
              / o \           -  ===)
             /o   o\          -  ==)
             \_o_o_/          -  ===)________
                                  --=_________
                              
                              +---  THE PINS (NOT ALL FIVE CAN BE SHOWN)
 
         THE KEY IS A SMALL CIRCULAR TUBE LIKE KEY WITH A LITTLE NOTCH
         AT THE END OF THE KEY, WITH FIVE SMALL DITCHES IN THE TUBE.
         WHEN ALL THE PINS ARE ARRANGED SO THAT THE LOCK TURNS, PRESTO!!!
         SOME HAVE SEVEN PINS....
 
 
SO TO MAKE A KEY THAT WORKS WITH 5 PIN BIKE LOCKS AND ET.  AL.
 
MAKING THE KEY IS VERY HARD...YOU HAVE TO MAKE A KEY, EVERYTIME YOU USE IT,
ONCE!   THIS IS A BITCH.   THE PARTS AREN'T THE EASIEST TO FIND EITHER.
 
FIND 5 SPRING STEEL NEEDLES THICK ENOUGH FOR STRENGTH, BUT THIN ENOUGH TO
FIT INTO THE SIDES OF THE LOCKS.   GET A TUBE THAT FITS THE LOCK PERFECTLY.
YOU CAN KEEP THE TUBE FOREVER.   TAPE THE SPRING STEEL NEEDLES ONTO THE PIPE.
LET THE SPRINGS STICK OUT ABOUT 5 mm OUT OF THE PIPE.   BUT MAKE SURE NONE OF
THE SPRINGS ARE LAYED OUT EVENLY.   NOW, INSERT IT INTO THE LOCK.   GIVE IT A
RAPID IN AND OUT MOTION.   GET A SURGICAL SPRING NEEDLE FROM YOUR BIOLOGY
LABORATORY AND USE THAT TO ROTATE THE LOCK AS YOU JIGGLE IT IN AND OUT.   I
HAD A HELL OF A HARD TIME PICKING OPEN A KRYPTONITE LOCK.   I LOST MY KEYS
TO MY BIKE AND IT WAS LOCKED TO A POLE.   IT TOOK ME ABOUT 20 MINUTES.   I HAD
SUCCESSFULLY OPENED ONLY 5 OF THESE TYPES OF LOCKS, ONE OF THEM BEING A SEVEN
PIN.   IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND HARD.   BUT WORK ON IT.
 
 
OPENING CAR DOOR TYPE 1:
------------------------
I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN TEACHING HOW TO OPEN CAR DOORS.   I'LL TELL YOU
THE TWO BASIC WAYS OF DOING IT.   THE FIRST TECHNIQUE IS THE FOLLOWING:

A CAR WITH A LIPPED DOOR LOCK:
 
           ___
          (   )     ----- DOOR LOCK
            
   ________ ___________
           _
 
 
THESE DOORS ARE SO EASY TO PICK, IT TAKES A PRO ONLY ABOUT A SECOND TO OPEN
IT.   JUST GET A HANGER AND TAKE IT APART TO BE A SO CALLED STRAIGHT WIRE.
BEND IT LIKE THE FOLLOWING.
 
 
 
 
     _________________________
                        ______
 
                        (  L  )  L = LENGTH (ABOUT 1-1/2 INCHES)
 
     THE LOOP PART OF THE HOOK SHOULD BE JUST BIG ENOUGH TO GRAB THE LOCK.
 
JUST STICK IT IN THRU THE SIDE OF THE WINDOW.   AS YOU INSERT IT, BEND IT
TOWARDS THE LOCK.   IF THE GAP OF BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW IS TOO SMALL,
THEN USE THE SECOND TECHNIQUE.   AS YOU APPROACH THE LOCK AND GET A HOLD OF IT,
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SNUG GRIP ON THE LOCK BY TUGGING ON IT ONCE AND PULL
IT IN AN UPWARD MOTION, FAST.   PRESTO!!!   IT'S OPEN.   THIS IS VERY SY.
JUST PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN CAR OR SOMETHING, IF YOU GET A CHANCE, PRACTICE IN
A SAFE LOOKING PARKING LOTS, (METRO, OR PRIVATE LOTS.) AND YOU'LL GET THE
HANG OF IT.
 
OPENING CAR DOOR TYPE 2:
------------------------
THIS ISN'T THAT HARD EITHER ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT.
 
YOU HAVE TO GET:
 
A METAL RULER ABOUT AN INCH IN WIDTH AND AT LEAST 2 FOOT IN LENGTH.
 
CUT THE METAL NOTCH IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION.
 
              
              
       _      
         \     
          \    
           \   
           /   
        __/   /
            /
            \_
              
              
       _______
 
DO IT ACCORDING TO THE HARDCOPY'S SCALE FOR THE CUTS OF NOTCHES.
IT IS AS CLOSE TO MINES AS POSSIBLE.   THEN INSERT THE STICK INTO THE
SIDE OF THE DOOR.   FEEL FOR A PIN INSIDE THE CAR DOOR.   ONCE YOU FIND THE
PIN, PUSH SLIGHTLY DOWN ON IT AND THE PULL UP FAST.   BINGO!   IT'S OPEN.
THIS NEEDS MORE PRACTICE THAN THE OTHER METHOD BUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECTION...SO PRACTICE HARD
