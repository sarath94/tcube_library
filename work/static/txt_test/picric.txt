How To Make Picric Acid
-----------------------

Method for the preparation of picric acid:

1. Phenol is melted and then mixed with a concentrated solution of sulfuric
        acid. The mixture is constantly stirred and kept at a steady
        temperature of 95 degrees C., for four to six hours, depending on the
        quantities of phenol used. 

2. After this, the acid-phenol solution is diluted with distilled water, and
        an equal excess amount of nitric acid is added. The mixture of the
        nitric acid will cause an immediate reaction, which will produce heat,
        so the addition of the acid must be performed slowly, but more
        importantly the temperature of the solution must NOT GO ABOVE 110 
        degrees C.

3. Ten or so minutes after the addition of the nitric acid, the picric acid
        will be fully formed, and you can draw off the excess acid. It should
        be filtered and washed in the same manner as above, until the litmus
        paper tests show that there is little or no acid present. When
        washing, use only cold water. After this, the picric acid should be
        allowed to partially dry.

Picric acid is a more powerful explosive than TNT, but it has disadvantages.
It is much more expensive to make, and is best handled in a wet 10% distilled
water form, as picric acid becomes very unstable when completely dry. This
compound should never be put into direct contact with any metal, since 
instantly on contact there is a formation of metal picrate, which explodes
spontanteously upon formation.
