            Imagine This. A Great, Inflated, Green Garbage Bag
 Slowly Wafting Down From A Tall Building. It Gains Some Speed
 As It Nears The Ground. People Look Up And Say, "What The....?"
 The Garbage Bag Hits! *Boom!!!* It Explodes In A Thundering
 Fireball Of Green Bits Of Plastic And Flame!
           "What Is This?" You May Ask. Well, This Is The Great
 "Acetylene Balloon Bomb." And Here Is How To Make It.

 Ingredients:
 ============
 (1>       For A Small Bomb: A Plastic Bag. Not Too Big.
           For Something Big(Ger): A Green, Plastic Garbage Bag.

 (2>       Some "Fun-Snaps". A Dozen Should Be More Than Enough.

 (3>       Some Garbage Bag Twisties. String Would Also Do.

 (4>       A Few Rocks. Not Too Heavy, But Depends On Size Of
           Bomb And Desired Velocity Of Balloon/Bomb.

 (5>       Prime Ingredient: Acetylene. This Is What Is Used In
           Acetylene Torches. More On This Substance Later.

 (6>       One Or More Eager Anarchists.

 Notes:
 ======
 Acetylene Is A Fairly Dangerous Substance. It Is Unstable Upon
 Contact With Oxygen (Air). For This Reason, And For Your
 Safety, I Recommend You Keep All Of The Acetylene Away From Any
 Source Of Oxygen. This Means Don'T Let It Get In Touch With
 Air.


 Construction:
 =============
 (1>       Fill Up A Bathtub With Cold Water. Make It Very Full.
 (2>       Now Get Put You Garbage Bag In The Water And Fill It
           With Water. Make Sure All Air/Oxygen Is Out Of The
           Bag Before Proceeding.
 (3>       Now Take Your Acetylene Source (I Used It Straight
           From The Torch, And I Recommend This Way Also.), And
           Fill The Bag Up With Acetylene.
 (4>       Now, Being Careful With The Acetylene, Take The Bag
           Out Of The Tub And Tie The Opening Shut With The
           Twisty Or String. Let The Balloon Dry Off Now. (Put
           It In A Safe Place.)
 (5>       Okay. Now That It Is Dry And Filled With Acetlene,
           Open It Up And Drop A Few Rocks In There. Also Add
           Some Fun-Snaps. The Rocks Will Carry The Balloon
           Down, And The Fun-Snaps Will Spark Upon Impact, Thus
           Setting Off The Highly Inflammable Acetylene.
           *Baboom!*
 (6>       Now Put The Twisty Or String Back On Very Tightly.
           You Now Have A Delicate But Powerful Balloon Bomb.

 To Use:
 =======
 Just Drop Off Of A Cliff, Airplane, Building, Or Whatever. It
 Will Hit The Ground A Explode In A Fireball. Be Careful You Are
 Not Near The Explosion Site. And Be Careful You Are Not
 Directly Above The Blast Or The Fireball May Rise And Give You
 A Few Nasty Burns.

     Well, This Bomb Was Constructed By Us In An Attempt To Not Only Make An
 Antipersonnel Device Which Was Easy To Construct, But Also To Create The
 Biggest Fireball That The World Has Ever Seen.  So, You Get The Power Of Pure
 Butane, With The Added Advantage Of Simplicity In Construction...Have Phun!

 _____________________________________________________________________________


                     Chapter The Next: Materials Required
 _____________________________________________________________________________


     1.  A Cannister Of Butane Fuel: Easy To Obtain, This Can Be Found At Just
         About Any Good Drugstore, Certainly At A Hardware Store.

     2.  Gun Powder: Not All That Tough To Get Ahold Of, Either Find A Phile
         Telling You How To Construct It By Hand, Or Snag Some Shotgun Shells
         At K-Mart And Empty The Powder Out Of Them.  You Can Use Firecrackers
         Instead Of Shotgun Shells, But You'Ll Need A Sufficient Amount Of
         Powder, So Unless You Want To Spend Five Years Emptying Firecrackers,
         Stick To The Shells.

     3.  Plastic Container: Preferably A Tupperware-(Tm) Glass, As It Will Bot

         Melt Away And Explode, While Glass Will Shatter With Heat, And Metal
         Will Not Explode.

     4.  A Fuse: You Can Buy These In Places, But If You Don'T Want To Go Thru
         The Hassle, Simply Rub Model Glue All Over A String, It'Ll Work Just
         As Well.

     5.  Masking Tape: Or Electrical Tape, Or Cellophane Tape, Or Whatever Kin

         Of Tape That You'Ve Got Lying 'Round The House.

     1.  Fill The Plastic Container With 1/4 To 1/2 Inch Of Powder.

     2.  Center The Butane In The Container, Atop The Powder.

     3.  Fill The Rest Of The Container With Powder, Around The Butane.  Pack
         It Down -- Lightly, Just So That It Fully Fills In The Container.

     4.  Insert The Fuse At Least 1/2 Inch Into The Powder, And Pack The
         Surrounding Powder As In Step 3.  Seal The Top Of The Container Aroun

         The Butane With A Small Covering Of Masking Tape.

     5.  Plant The Device In A Target Area.

     6.  Light The Fuse, And...

     7.  Run Like Hell!!

     8.  (Detonation): If This Is Done Correctly, And You Get Well Out Of Rang

         Of The Fireball, The Immediate, (And Non-Immediate), Area Will Be "Up
         In Smoke," Persay.

Letter Bombs Are Very Simple To Make,  But The Difficult Part Is Making Sure It
Will Detonate Properly, Or That It Is Not Obvious That It Is A Bomb.

 Mixtures:

About 75% Aluminum Powder With 25% Iron Power Is Best.  This Is A Light Version
Of Thermite, Since It Is In An Enclosed Space (The Envelope, As Described Below
A Ways).   Mix The Above Well.  The Idea Is This: Iron Can Burn, At A Very High
Temperature,   But It Needs A Little Help.   This Is What The Aluminum Is  For.
Aluminum Burns At A Relatively Low Temperature,  So It Is Used As A Catalyst Of
Sorts.    Magnesium Is Used To Flash-Ignite The Aluminum,  Which Then Burns The
Iron, At A Suitable Temperature.  Since This Is Going Off In An Enclosed Space,
It  Will Burn Much Hotter And Slower And With More Violence Than A Normal  Mix.
I Advise You Play With This For A While, Learning Your Mixture.

 Now For The Fun Stuff:

Get An Insulated (Padded) Envelope, The Type That Is Double Layered.   Seperate
The  Layers.    In  The Inner Layer Goes The Wonderful Mixture,   One  You  Are
Satisfied With.   Keep This Section Seperate,  But It Might Be Handle To Top It
Off With Some Magnesium.   The Outer Layer Can Be Either Magnesium, For A Flash
Bomb, Or Possibly A Material Of Your Own Choice.

 Now For The Difficult Part!

The Fuse...  We Can Make A Fuse From Another Set Of Chemicals: Iodine Crystals,
And Amonium Hydroxide, In Liquid Form.   Mix These Together, In About And Equal
Amount, But You Might Want To Use A Heavy Amount Of Iodine If Pressed For Time.
These Form A New Crystalline Structure, About And Inch Long.   These Are Highly
Volatile,   And  I Advise Keeping Them Protected.   They Have About The  Impact
Power  Of  An  M-100 For A Teaspoon.   I Put These In A  Protective  Card-Board
Lining, And Put Them At The Top Of The Envelope.   Rig This So It Puts Pressure
On  The  Crytals When The Package Is Opened,  But Not From Just  Squeezing  The
Envelope.   This Is Tricky, And I Can'T Explain It Here.  Seal This Up, And You
Have  A Working Letter Bomb.   By The Way,  Since The Bulk Of Letter Bombs  Are
Easily Recognizable, They Rarely Make It Past The Post Office.

 *****

I  Frown  Upon The Use Of Letter Bombs As A Means Of Getting Even  Because  You
Never  Know Who It Is Going To Detonate Around,  Or That It Will Even Be  Them.
There  Are  Simpler Ways Of Getting Even,  So Take One Of Them.   It Is Also  A
Federal Offence To Make And Send One.  Procede At Your Own Risk.

 *****

How  To Avoid Letter Bombs:  Since You Made It This Far Into The File,  I  Will
Tell  You How To Avoid Being Detonated With A Letter Bomb You May Have Had Sent
To You.   1)  Never Open A Letter Bomb The Way It Wants To Be Opened!   This Is
The  Way  Of Possibly Avoiding The Fuse.   If It Is Set To Detonate On  Contact
With Air, Then This Will Not Work.  2) Don'T Squeeze, Bend, Or Anything!  3) If
It Looks Like A Bomb, Then Don'T Even Touch It!   This Is The Best Way To Avoid
Problems!

             How To Make:
               T.N.T
 ---------------------------------------

Mix  170 Parts Tolulene With 100 Parts Acid.   The Acid Made Of 2 Parts Of  70%
Nitric And 3 Parts Of 100% Sulfuric.   Mix Below 30 Degrees.Set This For 30 Min
And  Let It Separate.   Take The Mononitrotolulene And Mix 100 Part Of It  With
215 Parts Of Acid.  This Acid Is 1 Part Pure Nitric And 2 Parts Pure Sul Furic.
Keep The Temp.  At 60-70 While They Are Slowly Mixed.  Raise Temp To 90-100 And
Stir  For 30 Min.   The Di- Nitrotoluene Is Separated And Mix 100 Parts Of This
With  225  Parts Of 20% Oleum Which Is 100% Sulfuric With 20%  Extra  Dissolved
Sulfur Trioxide, And 65 Parts Nitric Acid.  Heat At 95 Degrees For 60 Min.  And
Then At 120 Degrees For 90 Min.Separate The Trinitrotoluene And Slosh It Around
In Hot Water.  Purify The Powder By Soaking It In Benzene.

Nitroglycerin [Heretofore Nitro] Is A Very Powerful High- Explosive.   I Am Not
Sure  Who  Invented  It But He Probably Didn'T-- The First Person  To  Make  It
Probably  Blew  Himself  Up And His Freind Got The Info Off His  Notes.    Well
Anyway,   The Next Best Thing To Nitro Is Tnt Which Is Ten Times Harder To Make
But  Also Ten Times Safer To Make.   If You Can'T Use Nse Then Dont Even Try To
Make This Stuff--A Few Drops Can Bbcircumstances.

 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

      To Make Nitro:
      == ==== ======

Mix  100  Parts Fuming Nitric Acid (For Best Results It Should Have A  Specific
Gravity Of 50 Degrees Baume') With 200 Parts Sulphuric Acid.   This Is Going To
Be  Hot  At First--It Won'T Splatter If You Pour The Nitric Into The  Sulphuric
But Don'T Try It The Other Way Around.  The Acid Solutions Together Can Disolve
Flesh  In  A  Matter Of Seconds So Take The Proper Measures For  God'S  Sake!!!
When Cool,  Add 38 Parts Glycerine As Slowly As Possible.   Let It Trickle Down
The  Sides  Of  The Container Into The Acids Or It Won'T Mix Thourily  And  The
Reaction Could Go To Fast--Which Causes Enough Heat To Ignite The Stuff.   Stir
With  A **Glass** Rod For 15 Seconds Or So Then Carfully Pour It Into 20  Times
It'S *Volume* Of Water.  It Will Visibly Precipitate Immediatly.  There Will Be
Twice  As Much Nitro As You Used Glycerin And It Is Easy To Separate.   Mix  It
With Baking Soda As Soon As You Have Separated It-- This Helps It Not To Go Off
Spontainously.

 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Notes:   Parts  Are By Weight And The Baume'  Scale Of Spicific Gravity Can  Be
Found  In  Most Chem.   Books.   You Can Get Fuming Nitric And  Sulfuric  Acids
Wherever  Good Chemicals Or Fertilizers Are Sold.   It Is Positivly *Stupid* To
Make  More  Than  200 Grams Of Nitro At A Time.   When Mixing  The  Stuff  Wear
Goggles, Gloves, Etc.  When I First Made The Stuff I Had The Honor Of Having It
Go Off By Itself (I Added Too Much Glycerine At A Time.)  I Was Across The Room
At  The Time,  But I Felt The Impact--So Did The Table It Was On As Well As The
Window It Was Next To--They Were Both Smashed By Only 25 Grams In An Open Bowl.
Oh,  Yes, Glycerine You Can Get At Any Pharmacy And You Need An Adult Signature
For The Acids.  Any Bump Can Make Nitro Go Off If You Don'T Add The Bicarbonate
Of (Baking) Soda--But Even With That, If It Gets Old I Wouldn'T Play Catch With
It.

 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Once  You  Have Made The Nitro And Saturated It With Bicarb.   You Can  Make  A
Really  Powerful Explosive That Won'T Go Off By Itself By Simply Mixing It With
As Much Cotton As You Can And Then Saturating That With Molten ((Parifine--Just
Enough To Make It Sealed And Hard.  Typically, Use The Same Amounts (By Weight)
Of Each Nitro, Cotton And Parifine.   This, When Wrapped In Newspaper, Was Once
Known As "Norbin & Ohlsson'S Patent Dynamite," But That Was Back In 1896.


Thermite  Is A Powerful Substance Which Can Burn Through Practically  Anything,
Save  Tungsten.    It Is Especially Of Use In Trying To Crack Open  A  Fortress
Fone.  Now Here'S How You Make It.  It Is Very Simple.

The  First  Step In Making Thermite Is To Make Hematite.   In  Layman'S  Terms,
Hematite  Is  Iron  Oxide  (Rust).    Here Is A Good  Method  Of  Making  Large
Quantities  Of Rust.   Ou Will Electrolyze A Metal Rod,  Such As A Common Nail.
You  Will Need A Source Of Dc Power As Well.   An Electric Train Transformer Is
Perfect.  Attatch Therod To The Positive Wire.

Then  Place  The  Rod And The Negative Wire In Opposite Sides Of  A  Glass  Jar
Filled  With  Water.   Put A Little Salt In The Water,  Just Enough To Make  It
Conduct Well (A Teaspoon).  Let The Setup Sit Overnight.  In The Morning, There
Will  Be A Dark Red Crud In The Jar.   Filter All The Crud Out Of The Water  Or
Just Fish It Out With A Spoon.  Now You Will Need To Dry It Out.  Heat It In An
Iron Pot Untill It All Turns A Nice Light Red.

The  Other Ingrediant You Will Need Is Aluminum Filings.   You Can Either  File
Down  A Bar Of Aluminum,  Or (As I Suggest)  Buy Aluminum Filings At Your Local
Hardware Shop.   (If You Buy The Bar Use No Less Than 94% Pure Aluminum.  It Is
Called Duralumin.)  That'S Almost It.   Now, Mix Together The Rust And Aluminum
Filings.   The Ratio Should Be 8 Grams Of Rust Per 3 Grams Of Aluminum Filings.
That'S Thermite!

Now,   To  Light  It!    Stick A Length Of Magnesium Ribbon In A  Pile  Of  The
Thermite.    (Either  Steal It From Chem Lab Or Buy It At Your  Local  Hardware
Store.   If Not, Order From A Chemical Supply House.   It'S Pretty Cheap.)  The
Ribbon Should Stick Into The Thermite Like A Fuse.  Now You Light The Magnesium
With  A  Blowtorch.   (Don'T Worry.   The Torch Isn'T Hot Enough To  Light  The
Thermite.)    When The Burning Magnesium Reaches The Thermite,  It Will  Light.
When  The Thermite Burns,  Get The Hell Back!   That Stuff Can Vaporize  Carbon
Steel.  It Does Wonders On Human Flesh.

Armored Vehicles.

Shock  Waves  From  A Detonating Block Of Explosive Emerge  In  All  Directions
Creating  A Generalized Blast Effect.   It Is Possible,  However,  To Shape  An
Explosive  Charge  In  Such  A Way That A Portion Of The Shock  Waves  Will  Be
Focussed  And  Concentrated  On  A Very Small Area,  Thereby  Creating  A  Very
Powerful  Puncturing Or Drilling Action.   When The Charge Is Detonated Against
The  Side  Of  A Tank,  The Shock Waves Emerging From The  Conical  Cavity  Are
Focussed On One Spot Where They Will Penetrate Several Inches Of Steal.

We   Will  Discuss  Two  Different  Ways  Of  Making  Cone  Shaped  Charges   :

<1> Martini Glass
<2> Wine Bottle

Martini Glass Cone Shaped Charge
================================
  You Will First Need The Following
Materials To Construct This Charge :

<1> Martini Or Wine Glass
<2> Tube (Cardboard Or Similar)
<3> Sticks (3-4)
<4> Tape
<5> Explosive (Preferably Plastic...
    See G-File With That Title)

Preparation
-----------
<1> File A Notch Around The Stem Where
    The Cup Part Meets The Stem And
    Then Break It Off.

<2> Place The Glass Upside Down In The
    Container.  Unless The Glass Is
    Wedged Firmly, Tape It To Hold It
    In Place.

<3> Pack The Explosive Behind The Glass
    Tamping It Carefully To Provide
    Good Density.  For Best Results
    The Explosive Should Be No Closer
    To The Mouth Of The Glass Than
    The Point Where It Was Cut.
    (See Diagram)

<4> Tape The Whole Charge To Assure It
    Remains In Firm Condition.

Notice The Spce Between The Cone- Shaped Glass And The Explosive.   This Allows
Area For The Charge To Focuss And Is Quite Important To Its Success.

Here  Is  A  Diagram Demonstrating How To Place The Explosive On Its  Target  :


Diagram Of Placed Charge
------------------------

               ========
               =******=
 Explosive ==> =******=
               =******=
               =  ..  =
   Glass   ==> = .... =
              ^=......=^
              ^========^
 Support   ==>^^  ^^  ^^
  Tripod      ^^  ^^  ^^
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\ Target'S Armored \\\\\
\\\\\\\\ Surface \\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



The  Support  Tripod Shown Should Roughly Place The Explosive Some  4-5  Inches
Above  The Target'S Surface To Maximize Penetration.   This Is Again  Following
The Same Principle As Placing The Explosive Totally Behind The Cone.


Wine Bottle Shaped Charge
=========================

If You Can Find A Wine Bottle With A Dome Shaped Bottom (Not The Mouth) You Can
Make A Quite Effective Charge From It Also.

Materials
---------

<1> Wine Bottle With Cavity Base
<2> Tublular Container
<3> Sticks
<4> Tape
<5> Shoelace
<6> Gasoline
<7> Bucket Of H2O
<8> Explosive

Procedure
---------

<1> Remove All Labels From Bottle.

<2> Soak Shoelace In Gas

<3> Tie String Around The Bottle Where
    You Wish To Cut It.  (Anywhere
    Below Neck)

<4> Grasp The Bottle By The Neck,
    Light The String, And As String
    Burns Rotate Glass Horizontaly.

<5> When The Burning Begins To Die
    Plunge The Bottle Into The H2O.

<6> The Bottle Should Crack Easily
    Along Where The String Was Tied.
    (Good Glass Cutting Method)

<7> Cover The Remaining Sharp Edges
    With Rags To Make It Easier To
    Handle.

<8> Use Wine Bottle Bottom Just Like
    The Win Glass In The First Part.
