HOW TO MAKE A REALLY NICE PIPE BOMB
OUT OF EVERYDAY MATERIALS.

1) GO TO YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND
TELL THE GUY THAT IS HELPING YOU
THAT YOU WANT A PIECE OF STEEL PIPE
ONE FOOT LONG. AND ALSO THAT YOU WANT
THE ENDS THREADED AND YOU ALSO WANT
CAPS TO PUT ON THE END.

2) NOW GET AHOLD OF A BABYFOOD JAR.
MAKE SURE THAT THE JAR WILL FIT DOWN
THE PIPE REAL EASY LIKE. FILL THE
BABYJAR WITH EVERYDAY VINEGAR. MAKE
SURE THE TOP IS SCREWED ON REAL TIGHT.
**IF IT IS LOOSE YOU WILL BLOW YOUR
HAND OFF**

3)NOW CAP ONE END OF YOUR PIPE WITH
ONE OF THE CAPS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
PICKED UP WITH THE PIPE. IF YOU KNOW
OF SOMEONE WITH A WIELDER, HAVE HIM
WIELD A BEAD AROUND THE THREADS AFTER
YOU HAVE IT CAPPED.

4)PUT SOME SMALL SHARP ROCKS DOWN THE
END OF THE PIPE AND THEN SLIDE THE
BABYJAR DOWN INSIDE SO THE GLASS END
IS AGAINST THE LITTLE ROCKS. NOW
EMPTY A MEDIUM BOX OF ARM AND HAMMER
BAKING SODA INTO THE PIPE. CAP THE
OTHER END OF THE PIPE AND IF YOU
CAN WIELD IT, THEN GO FOR IT.
**BE FUCKING CAREFUL** YOU MIGHT
BREAK THE JAR INSIDE AND YOU WON'T
KNOW THAT YOU BROKE IT UNTIL YOU 
SEE YOUR HAND FLY OFF!!!

5)NOW, WHEN YOU WANT TO BLOW SOMETHING
UP, JUST SMACK THE END OF THE PIPE 
THAT SENDS THE JAR INSIDE DOWN AGAINST
THE SMALL ROCKS. OH YEAH, SMACK IT
AGAINST SOME CONCREAT. THIS BREAKS
THE JAR AND THE VINEGAR AND BAKING
SODA MIX TOGETHER AND BUILDS UP
PRESSURE. WHEN IT GETS TO THE 
CRITICAL POINT....WHAMMY!!!!

******IMPORTANT******

AFTER YOU HIT THE PIPE AGAINST THE
GROUND, GET THE HELL RID OF IT!!!
TOSS IT INTO SOMEONES CAR OR SOMEWHERE.
SOMETIMES. IT TAKES FIVE MINUTS FOR
IT TO GO OFF. SOMETIMES TWO.
BUT IT WILL GO OFF! TRUST ME!

I DID THIS WHEN I WAS LIVING IN
ARIZONA. MY FREIND THAT TAUGHT ME
THIS WAS A DEMOLITIONS EXPERT FOR 
THE NAVY.

THE FIRST TIME I DID IT. WE TOSSED
THE PIPE INTO AN OLD HOUSE AND IT
BLEW ALL FOUR WALLS OUT!!
THE SECOND TIME WE DID IT, WE TOSSED
IT INTO AN OLD CAR. AND IT PHUKING
BLEW ALL FOUR DOORS OFF AND THE 
ROOF THREE FEET INTO THE AIR!!!!

WHEN WE BLEW U THE HOUSE, WE WAITED
FIVE MINUTSAND I THOUGHT THAT IT
WOULDN'T GO OFF. SO I CRAWLED OUT OF
THE DITCH THAT WE WERE IN. WHAMMY!!
JUST THEN IT WENT OFF! IT THREW ME
BACK FIVE FEET BACK INTO THE DITCH!

IF YOU FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS 
REAL CAREFULLY. THEN YOU WON'T GET
HURT.


TO MAKE AN EVEN NICER PIPE BOMB THE EASY WAY:

GET A LEAD PIPE OR CUT THE PIPE OFF YOUR NEIGHBORS
FENCE.MAKE IT ABOUT 1 FOOT LONG.AFTER DOING THIS-
HAMMER ONE END CLOSED.THEN ADD A MIXTURE OF SALT
PETER OTHERWISE KNOWN AS POTASIUM NITRATE AND MIX
5 OUNCES OF SALT PETER AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT
SUGAR..YOU CAN DOUBLE THE RECIPE IF NECCESARY.
DRILL A SMALL HOLE FOR THE WICK.CLOSE OFF THE OTHER
END.INSERT THE FUSE..MAKE THE FUSE LONG!GREAT
FOR BLOWING UP MAILBOXES!!!!

Ok well what you will do is get some gun
powder(see message on how to make it)
but if you can buy it you are better
off. You can get it at most gun shops
if you are over 18. Now what you do
is go down to a hardware store and buy
lead piping about 4-6 inches long
and 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches thick. 
Get two caps for each pipe. Now drill
a hole in the center of the pipe
through one side. Put one cap on and fill
the pipe up with powder. Put the other
cap on. Sticka long fuse in the hole
and use model glue or something to
keep it in. Then light it and get 
away fast!!!!! The caps will usually
fly off so if you have a target aim
one of the caps at it and leave the other
one 1/2 turn from fully tight. But still
stand way out of range as this is very
dangerous.
