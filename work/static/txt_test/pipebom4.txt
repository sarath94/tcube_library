This bomb is sometimes called a PIPE BOMB.  It is basically a metal pipe
packed with explosives and lots of nails, tacks, or other metal fragments
to cause shrapnel to fly about causing general havoc.

One such bomb was set off in England during a parade or something and
killed several people and injured dozens more.  Just a little note to
prove not all of these information files are full of SH*T.


Materials-->> paper, thick metal pipe with cap on one end, a box of tacks
              and/or roofing nails, lots of gunpowder or equivilant
              explosive, fusing core or solar igniter assembly, and a paper
              cup.

Procedure-->> Take the pipe and make sure the cap is firmly on the end.
              Fill the pipe up at around 3-4 in.with lightly packed
              gunpowder. Punch a hole in the cup to place the fuse/or
              gunpowder in. Shove the cup with fuse init down the pipe to
              compress and hold the powder. Now that you've done this, fill
              the remaining space in the pipe with tacks, nails, or any
              metal shrapnel. Cover the end with paper and tape it to hold
              the stull in. Make sure the fuse is hanging out of the pipe.
