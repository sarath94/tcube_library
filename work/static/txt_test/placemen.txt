Placement Of Charges
--------------------

        In demolition work, the greatest problem is the actual placement of
the charges. When an individual is working on a large structure such as a
building or a bridge, it is imperative that he have an understanding of the
directional force of explosives, and the structure's weaknesses. These
large-type structures are built to bear up under abnormal stress, so the
chances are good, unless the charges are placed correctly, that the sabotage
will have little or no effect.
        When attempting the demolition of a building, the first thing to do is
to determine the weakest point in the structure. This is the point where a
charge can be placed and well-tamped, and will result in maximum destruction.
A large building will usually take more than just one charge. The best bet is
to place large explosive charges on either side of a weak point in the
foundations. These charges should be tamped from the outside, so as to drive
the force inward.
        There are several basic methods of planting explosives. The advantage 
to most of the ones listed below is that they have a natural tamping factor,
built-in.

[1> Bury the explosive beneath the object of destruction.
[2> Drill a bore hole into the object and fill with explosives.
[3> Form a brace to hold the explosives tight against the object of
destruction. A good brace can be made from wood placed on a diagnol, with one
end jammed into the ground.
[4> Place a charge out in the open, with the tamping material surrounding it,
and directing its force.
