                RECIPE FOR A STANDARD PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE
                ***************************************

INGREDIENTS:

-GASOLINE - 1 PART
-OIL - 1 HALF PART
-STYROFOAM - 1

1) MELT STYROFOAM.  -REMEMBER NEVER AT ANY TIME LET THE
   MIXTURE GET TOO HOT.

2) LET COOL TO A THICK VISCOSITY.

3) MIX 3 INGREDIENTS TOGETHER IN FOLLOWING ORDER: FIRST ADD
   STYROFOAM, THEN OIL, THEN GAS.

4) MIX IN A DEEP POT - KEEP MIXTURE AWAY FROM ANY TYPE OF FIRE! DO THIS
   STEP WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

5) LET THE MIXTURE COOL TO A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE -
   AROUND 88 DEGREES FARENHEIT.

6) MOLD THE MIXTURE HOW YOU WANT.  (DIFFERENT SHAPES WILL MAKE IT MORE
   OR LESS LETHAL).

OPTIONAL: YOU CAN ADD NUTS, BOLTS, AND SCREWS WHILE MIXING, ALONG WITH
GUNPOWDER, 2 M-80'S, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE TO MAKE IT THE
EQUIVILANT OF A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.

NOTE: THE FRAGMENTS (NUTS, BOLT, ETC.) ARE DEADLY. THEY WILL PENETRATE A BRICK
WALL WHEN THE MIXTURE IS DETONATED.

============
:DETONATION:
============

1) THE MIXTURE CAN BE THROWN, BUT SOMETIMES DETONATION DOES NOT OCCUR.

2) THE MIXTURE CAN BE WIRED FOR AN ELECTRIC CHARGE TO BE SENT THROUGH
   IT, IT WILL DETONATE WITHOUT DOUBT.  A REGULAR FUSE CAN BE SENT THROUGH
   IT ALSO. IF THIS METHOD IS USED,  SOME SORT OF TIMER IS RECOMMENDED.
