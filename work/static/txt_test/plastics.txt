Plastic Explosives

Ingredients:

   * Potassium chlorate (or sodium chlorate)
   * Petroleum jelly (Vaseline)
   * a big bowl
   * a rolling pin or something similar

Procedure:

   * Spread out the chlorate crystals and crush them very fine with the
     rolling pin.
   * Mix 9 parts chlorate with 1 part petroleum jelly in the bowl until
     it's a uniform mixture
   * Store in a waterproof container. Needs a detonator of some sort to set
     it off. I haven't tried this myself, but it's from the Department of
     the Army's "Improvised Munitions Handbook," and they say they've
     tested it and it works.
