                        HOW TO MAKE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES

A PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER CAN BE MADE FROM POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND PETROLEUM
JELLY. THIS EXPLOSIVE CAN BE DETONATED IN ANY MILITARY BLASTING CAP. (FIND A
FRIEND IN THE SERVICE OR IN THE RESERVE, OR STEAL ONE).

MATERIALS:
----------
POTASSIUM CHLORATE - THIS CHEMICAL IS USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES, AND IN
                     THE MANUFACTURE OF MATCHES.

PETROLEUM JELLY - JUST GET SOME VASELINE OR NO-NAME BRAND.

PIECE OF ROUND STICK

WIDE BOWL OR OTHER CONTAINER FOR MIXING INGREDIENTS.


PROCEDURE:
----------
1) SPREAD THE POT. NIT. CRYSTALS THINLY ON A HARD SURFACE.  ROLL THE ROUND
STICK
   OVER THE CRYSTALS TO CRUSH INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHEAT FLOUR.

2) PLACE 9 PARTS POWDERED POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND 1 PART PETROLEUM JELLY IN A
   WIDE BOWL OR SILILAR CONTAINER.  MIX THE INGREDIENTS WITH YOUR HANDS
(KNEAD)
   UNTIL A UNIFORM PASTE IS OBTAINED.

STORE THE EXPLOSIVE IN A WATERPROOF CONTAINER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO USE IT.



PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES-

    MIX 7 PARTS POTASSIUM CHLORATE FOR EVERY ONE PART OF PETROLEUUM JELLY
    (VASELINE WILL DO) THEN USE AN ELECTRIC CHARGE OR A FUSE.

NITRO IODIDE-

    OK, THIS IS HOW TO MAKE NITRIC IODIDE. MIX SOME SOLID IODINE WITH
    HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA. WAIT OVERNIGHT. POUR OFF THE LIQUID. LET THE MUD FROM
    THE BOTTOM DRY ON A HARD SURFACE OUTSIDE LIKE CONCRETE. THROW SOMETHING ON
    IT. IT WILL GO OFF AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE BECAUSE IT IS SO UNSTABLE.

KITCHEN IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES
BY TIM LEWIS PART II  RDX MANUFACTURE

RDX IS THE MAIN INGREDIANT IN THE REST
OF THE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES I WILL COVER.
THE PRODUCTION OF RDX IS VERY DANGEROUS
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY OF THIS IF YOU WISH
TO LIVE TILL YOUR NEXT BIRTHDAY!

SINCE THE FIRST PART OF WWII THE ARMED
FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
SEARCHING FOR THE PERFECT PLASTIQUE
EXPLOSIVES TO BE USED IN DEMOLITION
WORK. THIS SEARCH LEAD TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE 'C' COMPOSITION
PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVES. OF THIS GROUP
C-4 BEING THE LASTEST FORMULATION THAT
HAS BEEN READILY ADOPTED BY THE ARMED
FORCES. THIS FORMULATION WAS PRECEDED
BY C-3, C-2, AND C.

IN THIS SERIES OF ARTICLES, I WILL
COVER ALL THESE EXPLOSIVES IN THEIR
CHRONOLOGICAL PROGRESSION AS THEY WERE
DEVELOPED AND STANDARDIZED BY THE ARMED
FORCES. ALL THESE EXPLOSIVES ARE
CYCLONITE OR R.D.X. BASE WITH VARIOUS
PLASTISIZING AGENTS USED TO ACHIEVE THE
DESIRED PRODUCT.
THIS PLASTISIZER, USUALLY COMPOSES
7%-20% OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE
PLASTIQUE.
CYCLOTRIMETHYLENETRINITTRIME OR
CYCLONITE IS MANUFACTURED IN BULK BY
THE NITRATION OF
HEXAMETHYLENETETRAMINE, (METHENAMINE,
HEXAMINE, ETC., ETC.) WITH STRONG RED
100% NITRIC ACID.
THE HARDEST PART OF THIS REACTION IS
OBTAINING THIS RED NITRIC ACID. IT WILL
MOST LIKELY HAVE TO BE MADE. MORE ON
THIS LATER.
HEXAMINE OR METHENAMINE CAN USUALLY BE
BOUGHT IN BULK QUANTITIES OR HEXAMINE
FUEL BARS FOR CAMP STOVES CAN BE USED
BUT THEY END UP BEING VERY EXPLENSIVE.
TO USE THE FUEL BARS THE NEED TO BE
POWERED BEFORE HAND.
THE HEXAMINE CAN ALSO BE MADE WITH
COMMON AMMONIA WATER (30%) AND THE
COMMONLY AVALIABLE 36% FORMALDEHYDE
SOLUTION. TO MAKE THIS COMPONANT PLACE
185 GRAMS OF CLEAR AMMONIA WATER IN A
SHALLOW PYREX DISH. TO THIS ADD 500ML
OF THE FORMALDEHYDE SOLUTION TO THE
AMMONIA WATER. ALLOW THIS TO EVAPORATE
AND WHEN THE CRYSTALS ARE ALL THAT
REMAINS IN THE PAN PLACE THE PAN IN THE
OVEN ON THE LOWEST HEAT THAT THE OVEN
HAS. THIS SHOULD BE DONE ONLY FOR A
MOMENT OR SO TO DRIVE OFF ANY REMAINING
WATER. THESE CRYSTALS ARE SCRAPED UP
AND PLACED IN A AIRTIGHT JAR TO STORE
THEM UNTIL THEY ARE USED.
TO MAKE THE RED NITRIC ACID YOU WILL
NEED TO BUY A RETORT WITH A GROUND
GLASS STOPPER.  IN THE RETORT PLACE 32
GRAMS SULFURIC ACID, (98%-100%), AND TO
THIS ADD 68 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM NITRATE
OR 58 GRAMS OF SODIUM NITRATE.  GENTLY
HEATING THIS RETORT WILL GENERATE A RED
 GAS CALLED NITROGEN TRIOXIDE. THIS GAS
IS HIGHLY POISONOUS AND THIS STEP, AS
WITH ALL OTHER STEPS, SHOULD BE DONE WI
TH GOOD VENTILATION.
THIS NITRIC ACED THAT IS FORMED WILL
COLLECT IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND
FORM DROPLETS THAT WILL RUN DOWN THE
INSIDE OF THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND
SHOULD BE CAUGHT IN A BEAKER COOLED BY
BEING SURROUNDED BY ICE WATER.
 
THIS SHOULD BE HEATED TILL NO MORE
COLLECTS IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT AND
THE NITRIC ACID QUITS DRIPPING OUT OF
THE NECK INTO THE BEAKER.
THIS ACID SHOULD BE STORED UNTIL ENOUGH
ACID IS GENERATED TO PRODUCE THE
REQUIRED SIZE BATCH WHICH IS DETERMINED
BY THE PERSON PRODUCING THE ECPLOSIVE.
OF COURSE THE BATCH CAN BE LARGER OR
SMALLER BUT THE SAME RATIONS SHOULD BE
MAINTAINED.
TO MAKE R.D.X. PLACE 550 GRAMS OF THE
NITRIC ACID PRODUCED BY THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE IN A 1000 ML. BEAKER IN A SAL
TED BATH. 50 GRAMS OF HEXAMINE,
(METHENAMINE) IS ADDED IN SMALL
PORTIONS MAKING SURE THAT THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE ACID DOES NOT GO
ABOVE 30 DEGREES CELCIUS. THIS
TEMPERATURE CAN BE MONITORED BY PLACING
A THERMOMETER DIRECTLY IN THE ACID
MIXTURE. DURING THIS PROCEDURE A
VIGEROUS STIRRING SHOULD BE MAINTAINED.
IF THE TEMPERATURE APPROCHES 30
DEGREES, IMMEDIATLY STOP THE ADDITION
OF THE HEXAMINE UNTIL THE
TEMPERATURE DROPS TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL.
AFTER THE ADDITION IS COMPLETE CONTINUE
THE STIRRING AND ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE
TO DROP TO 0 DEGREES CELCIUS AND ALLOW
IT TO STAY THERE FOR 20 MINUTES
CONINUING THE VIGEROUS STIRRING. AFTER
THE 20 MINUTES ARE UP, POUR THIS
ACID-HEXAMINE MIXTURE INTO 1000 ML. OF
FINELY CRUSHED ICE AND WATER.
CRYSTALS SHOULD FORM AND ARE FILTERED
OUT OF THE LIQUID.
THE CRYSTALS THAT ARE FILTERED OUT ARE
R.D.X. AND WILL NEED TO HAVE ALL
TRACES OF THE ACID REMOVED. TO REMOVE
THIS TRACE OF ACID, FIRST WASH THESE
CRYSTALS BY PUTTING THEM IN ICE WATER
AND SHAKING AND REFILTERING. THESE
CRYSTALS ARE THEN PLACED IN A LITTLE
BOILING WATER AND FILTERED. PLACE THEM
IN SOME WARM WATER AND CHECK THE
ACIDITY FOR THE RESULTANT SUSPENSION
WITH LITMUS PAPER. YOU WANT IT TO READ
BETWEEN 6 AND 7 ON THE PH SCALE. IF
THERE IS STILL ACID IN THESE CRYSTALS
REBOIL THEM IN FRESH WATER UNTIL THE
ACID IS REMOVED AND THE LITMUS PAPER
SHOWS THEM BETWEEN 6 AND 7, (THE CLOSER
TO 7 THE BETTER).
TO BE SAFE THESE CRYSTALS SHOULD BE
STORED WATER WET UNTIL READY FOR USE.
THESE CRYSTALS ARE A VERY HIGH
EXPLOSIVE AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH
THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE! THIS
EXPLOSIVE IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN
T.N.T.
TO USE, THESE WILL NEED TO BE DRYED FOR
SOME MANUFATURING PROCESSES IN THE NEXT
FEW ARTICLES. TO DRY THESE CRYSTALS,
PLACE THEM IN A PAN AND SPREAD THEM
OUT AND ALLOW THE WATER TO EVAPORATE
OFF THEM UNTIL THE ARE COMPLETELY DRY.
THIS EXPLOSIVE WILL DETONATE IN THIS
DRY FORM WHEN PRESSED INTO A MOLD TO
A DENSITY OF 1.55 GRAMS CUBED, AT A
VELOCITY OF 8550 M/SECOND!
