 WELL IT SEEMS THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE
 BEEN WAITING FOR PART 3 SO THAT THE
 CAN BUILD BLASTING CAPS FOR THE FUN
 SHIT IN PARTS 1 & 2. SO YOU CAN STOP
 SENDING LETTER BOMBS TO ]<ING ]<ALADOR
 BECAUSE HERE IT IS...

  I. MERCURY FULMINATE
     MATERIALS:
     -NITRIC ACID (AVAILIBLE FROM
      INDUSTRIAL METAL PROCESSORS)
     -MERCURY (THERMOMETERS)
     -ETHYL ALCOHOL
     -PAPER TOWELS

     1. MIX 5 TSPS OF NITRIC ACID WITH
        2 1/2 TSPS OF WATER.
     2. ADD 1/8 TSP MERCURY TO THE
        NITRIC ACID/WATER SOLUTION.
        THIS SHOULD PRODUCE DARK RED
        FUMES.
     3. HEAT 10 TSPS OF ETHYL ALCOHOL
        UNTIL IT IS WARM.
     4. POUR THE MERCURY/ACID INTO THE
        ALCOHOL. WATCH THE WHITE FUMES
        FOR 15 MINNUTES BEFORE GOING
        TO STEP 5. (NOTE THAT THESE
        FUMES ARE HIGHLT TOXIC)
     5. TAPE THE PAPER TOWEL OVER A
        GLASS CONTAINER. POUR THE
        SOLUTION INTO THE CONTAINER.
     6. WASH THE CRYSTALS THAT COLLECT
        ON THE TOWEL WITH 6 TSPS OF
        ETHYL ALCOHOL.

 II. PICRIC ACID
     MATERIALS:
     -ASPRIN TABLETS
     -95% PURE ALCOHOL
     -SULFURIC ACID (FROM CAR BATTERY;
      BOIL UNTIL WHITE FUMES APPEAR)
     -POTASSIUM NITRATE (PART 1, III)

     1. CRUCH 20 ASPRIN IN A GLASS
        CONTAINER THEN ADD 1 TSP WATER
        AND MIX IT INTO A PASTE.
     2. ADD ABOUT 1/3 TO 1/2 CUP OF
        ALCOHOL TO THE ASPRIN PASTE
        WHILE STIRRING.
     3. TAPE A PAPER TOWEL OVER A GLASS
        CONTAINER AND POUR THE SOLUTION
        OVER IT. PITCH THE RESIDUE
        LEFT ON THE PAPER TOWEL.
     4. POUR THE FILTERED SOLUTION
        INTO A GLASS OR CERAMIC DISH.
     5. HEAT A PAN OF WATER 160 - 180
        DEGREES. PLACE THE DISH INTO
        THE PAN AND WAIT UNTIL THE
        ALCOHOL/WATER SOLUTION
        EVAAPORATES LEAVING BEHIND A
        WHITE POWDER.
     6. POUR 1/3 CUP OF SULFURIC ACID
        INTO A JAR THEN ADD THE WHITE
        POWDER.
     7. PLACE THE JAR INTO A PAN OF
        SIMMERING WATER FOR ABOUT 15
        MINUTES THEN REMOVE THE JAR
        FROM THE PAN. THE SOLUTION
        SHOULD TURN YELLOW-ORANGE IN
        COLOR.
     8. ADD 3 TSPS OF POTASSIUM NITRATE
        TO SOLUTION WHILE STIRRING
        VIGOROUSLY. THE SOLUTION WILL
        TURN RED THEN BACK TO YELLOW-
        ORANGE.
     9. ALLOW THE SOLUTION TO COOL TO
        ROOM TEMP WHILE STIRRING
        OCCASIONALLY.
    10. POUR THE SOLUTION GLASS
        CONTAINING 1 1/4 CUP OF WATER
        WHILE STIRRING VIGOROUSLY.
    11. FILTER THE SOLUTION THROUGH
        A PAPER TOWEL INTO A GLASS
        CONTAINER.
    12. WASH THE YELLOW PARTICLES THAT
        COLLECT ON THE TOWEL WITH 2
        TSPS OF WATER.
    13. PLACE THE PARTICLES IN A GLASS
        OR CERAMIC DISH AND SET IN
        SIMMERING WATER FOR 2 HOURS.

III. FUSE BLASTING CAP
     MATERIALS:
     -.75 GRAMS OF MERCURY FULMINATE
     -PICRIC ACID
     -SPENT CASING OF AT LEAST .22
      CALIBRE (.45, .50, .38, ETC.)
     -12'' FUSE

     1. REMOVE FIRED PRIMER FROM
        CASING USING SHARP NAIL.
     2. DRILL A HOLE IN THE END WIDE
        ENOUGH FOR THE FUSE TO FIT IN.
     3. THREAD IN THE FUSE THROUGH THE
        HOLE. TIE A KNOT IN ONE END
        OF THE FUSE SO THAT IT WON'T
        FALL OUT.
     4. FILL THE CASING WITH THE
        MERCURY FULMINATE.
     5. PACK THE MERCURY FULMINATE
        SNUGGLY USING A WOODEN STICK.
        BE GENTLE BECAUSE THE FULMINATE
        IS SHOCK SENSITIVE.
     6. ADD ONE GRAM OF PICRIC ACID.
     7. PACK THIS IN SNUGGLY, BUT
        GENTLY WITH THE WOODEN STICK.
     8. IF THERE IS ANY EXTRA SPACE,
        FILL IT AND PACK THE EXTRA WITH
        MERCURY FULMINATE.

 IV. ELECTRICAL BLASTING CAP
     MATERIALS:
     SAME AS ABOVE, EXCEPT REPLACE
     FUSE WITH THIN, INSULATED WIRE.

     1. STRIP ABOUT 1/4'' OF THE
        INSULATION FROM THE CENTER OF
        THE WIRE.
     2. DRILL 2 HOLES IN THE CASING.
     3. THREAD THE WIRE SO THAT THE
        NON-INSULATED AREA IS INSIDE
        THE CASING.
     4. GO TO STEP 4 OF THE FUSE
        BLASTING CAP.
     5. WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH STEP 8
        ABOVE, CONNECT ONE END OF
        THE WIRE TO THE POSITIVE LEAD
        OF A BATTERY (THE HIGHER THE
        VOLTAGE, THE BETTER).
     6. CONNECT ONE END OF A SECOND
        WIRE TO THE NEGATIVE LEAD AND
        OTHER END OF THE SECOND WIRE
        TO A SPST OR DPST OR OTHER
        2-WAY SWITH. (MAKE SURE THE
        SWITCH IS IN AN OFF POSI?YJ
     7. CONNECT THE OTHER END OF THE
        FIRST WIRE TO THE OTHER END
        OF THE SWITCH.
     8. THROUGH SWNITCH WHENEVER YOU'RE
        READY TO IGNITE THE BLASTING
        CAP.


NOTE: THESE BLASTING CAPS ARE MORE
      POWERFUL THAN THEIR STANDARD
      MILITARY COUSINS, AND SHOULD BE
      TREATED WITH CARE.
