Ok. Heres a really simple bomb that you 
can make from things you've probably go 
t lying around the house... What you ne 
eed: 
 
A bag of fertilizer 
Some Cotton 
Some Starter Fluid (etherous kind) 
Some Newspaper 
 
Ok... You fold the newspaper until its 
in sort of a pocket shape, then fill it 
up with fertilizer (not too much).. Nex 
t, you put cotton on top of the fertili 
zer. Then, pour some starter fluid on i 
t (the fertilizer), wrap up the newspap 
er (you can use tape). Now this isnt th 
e kind of bomb you leave lying around 
for a couple days, as it drys out. When 
you want to use it, just light the edge 
of the newspaper and throw it. Pretty 
simple, eh?  
Have Phun, and don't get caught!

P.s. I never noticed before, but all 
the formulas, etc. that the dude on 
macgyver uses are real, (i checked 
quite a few of em).
