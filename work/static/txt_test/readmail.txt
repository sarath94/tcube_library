  There are two traditional methods for reading the contents of a sealed
envelope.

Steaming - It is possible to expose the gummed edge of a sealed envelope
to a blast of steam and open it as the glue releases its grip on the paper.
This method, when done correctly, does not rip or otherwise damage the en-
velope and allows the material to be read and re-inserted and reglued after
perusal.

  Steaming also has a bad habit of wetting the entire surface to a great
enough degree to induce some inks to run, stamps to come off and requires a
fair amount of drying time after use to return paper to a non-wet state.

  Many modern envelopes require so much steam treatment before they open
that the paper never returns to it's original state but instead dries
to a different, and often noticeable texture.


Needles - The other system is to carefully undo a corner flap of the target
envelope. This flap need not be the top, many envelopes can be unfolded to a
great enough degree that a 1/4" space will appear at a bottom corner.

  At this point two knitting neddles are inserted into the gap, one on either
side of the letter.  The needles are then twisted around each other in order
to wrap the letter into a tube that can be withdrawn through the gap.

  The letter is then read, photographed, whatever,  and inserted back into the
envelope in the same fashion.  The gap is then refolded and/or reglued if
necessary to return the envelope to its original condition.


  Now, as they say in the ad business, there is a third choice.....

Chemical Inspection - The CIA and FBI have had access to this toy for some
years and it has finally dribbled down to the civilian market.

  Sold in a spray or aerosol container, this alcohol-based fluid turns most
papers transparent for 30-60 seconds.  This feature allows one to READ THE
CONTENTS WITHOUT EVER OPENING THE LETTER. The fluid then dries up leaving no
trace of its passing.  It has the added advantage of not smearing any inks...

  Of course, the entire letter may not be exposed if it is folded, but this
quick and easy solution (no pun intended) can solve many "tricky problems.

  This chemical is sold by LEA, Microtron, PK Electronics etc.  It averages
about $35 a bottle and is sold for letter bomb inspection purposes.

                                ********

  Want to save $49.00?? The chemical used is liquid Freon. It's available from
chemical or photographic suppliers and is used to clean video and film
equipment.......
