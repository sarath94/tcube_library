Part I: Basic Theory of Terrorism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file and its contents are by no means meant for anyone other than the serious anarchist. By thi we mean the person who has been going to school for at least half of his/her life and then realizin the true worthlessness of the American school system: i.e., the fact that it represses creativity, estroys imagination, and screws you up for the rest of your natural life. (Unless you are the type o person who ENJOYS the school ha what a laugh, in which case you should throw away this file and go ump off a high place.) The authors of this file have decided not to put in any sort of disclaimer, de to the fact that A) Disclaimers are of no use and will not help you in the least if you are reallybusted, and B) We don't really care if we are responsible or not for your actions. Far from it. As amatter of fact, we whole-heartedly reccommend them.
   
Part II: The Golden Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actually, there are two golden rules to follow when terrorizing a school. One is that you must do uno others before they do you. Two is that, no matter what this file reccommends, you will never go wrng if you follow your heart and use your imagination. These two qualities will be of more use to youthan any file could possibly be. With that said, let's get going.

Part III: Beginning terrorism       
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       

Your basic goal is to spread chaos and disorder throughout the entire school, but the best place to egin is in your own classroom. Here, you will find hall passes, absence excuse sheets, and many othe things that the school uses to control you. Steal these and give them away. If you're mercenary, sel them.  
But do NOT use them yourself! It's very un-anarchistic to profit from this sort of thing. Your goal s to introduce a thing called FREEDOM, not to make your life easier like the bloated capitalist pigswho are controlling you... Changing grades is another thing. You can give that little freshman geek ho sits next to you and gets all A's and sucks up to the faculty a big F. Watch him squirm. As befor, don't give your self an A. Don't even change your own grade! Everyone else's is fair play. Besides that takes suspicion off of you...
Now for more physical stuff. Krazy Glue has unlimited possibilities when it comes to school fun. Youcan glue the teachers' desk drawers shut, or if you're dexterous enough, glue her body to her chair.Also, glue things to the walls. We don't mean ordinary things here, we mean stuff like CHAIRS, TABLE
and PEOPLE. (It's one way of mounting your trophies without ruining them.)
Stretch fishing wire across the outside of a classroom door just before the end of sixth hour on a Fiday, and watch the fireworks.

Part IV: Getting Downright Nasty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Coat the insides of peoples' underwear with NAIR hair remover. You will see quite a lot of uncomfortble faces. Get some snakebite antidote, making sure its the "harmless" kind. Drink it
all down, walk into the principals' office, and puke your guts out all over him and his office. Apolgize profusely. Buy a few family-size bottles of floor wax and empty them all over the halls. (Make ure to leave yourself a clear space to escape!)
Open up the ceiling and stick dead animals inside. Open up someone's locker and put LIVE animals insde. For added effect, make sure they have eaten a while before.

Part V: Bathroom Fun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We were going to put this up there, but we decided that this subject needed a section of its own. Bahrooms are neat places. Hardly anyone ever uses them for their intended purpose. Girls use them to gssip, boys use them to smoke, and we're quite sure they've been used to masturbate on occasion. (Notthat we
are accusing either class.) Smoke bombs are fun to use. For a real treat, get the kind that smell lie burning marijuana. Blow up a balloon, seal it, and flush it down a toilet. Bring about 50 boxes ofJELL-O (tm) to school and fill the toilets with it. It takes about 30 minutes to solidify if its notstirred (and who's going to stir it? Not I...) Or, use the toilet without flushing it, and THEN add he JELL-O. Write your favorite phrases all over
the walls. An oldie but goodie is: "FUCK THE WORLD! ANARCHY RULES!" Or advertise your favorite musicl group.
Coat the toilet seats with Vaseline or some equally greasy substance. Use any kind of bomb to explod the toilet. See g-files such as CHEMICAL CORNER and HOME DEMOLITIONS for details on the best compac bombs.

Part VI: Definitely Not for Weaklings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Find some way to get into your school at night, and the world is your oyster! A friend of mine told e how her mother when she was going to high school, got hold of some pigs, painted the names of someobnoxious faculty members on their sides, and let them loose in the school to roam and play for the eekend. Those pigs did EVERYthing and then some. They got shit tracked all through the halls, they ae up a big shipment of cafeteria food, and in general had a high old time. Now THAT is what I call cassic. Any animal will do as long as it is a very curious and large one. If you have the nerve, pissin your pants while giving an oral report or rehearsing for a play. Shave your head. Or better yet, have someone else's head. Replace the American flag with one of  your own devising. Use your imaginaion here. Pretend to sell oregano and aspirin with the name rubbed off at lunchtime in sight of a techer. Pretend to have an epileptic fit. Get up on top of the school and keep warning them that you'l jump unless the letter "M" is stricken from the English language. Pretend to shoot up while being wtched by some asshole faculty member. Ask to make a phone call from a teacher who has his/her own phne in the room. Phreak with a box that is easily traced and tip off Ma Bell. If Ma doesn't believe i's a teacher, tell her it's "      " (put in the name of some geek you despise.)

Part VI: In Conclusion

         ** SCHOOL STOPPERS **
              
#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^
  The following section is reprinted from the 'School Stoppers Textbook' -a small section of the 'Ho to Revolt Handbook' -the fourth book of.... 'The Blacklisted News' -available for 13 bucks from theYouth International Party (Yippies). OK here we go - 81 ways to trash your school.

  Liberate your life - smash your school! The public schools are slowly killing every kid in them, sifling their creativity and individuality making them into non-persons. If you are a victim of this ne of the things you can do is fight back.
 
  This chapter is not written for people who are not yet sure whether school is good or bad. It is witten for students that realize the way that compulsory education and grades destroy the natural curosity so many children feel - who realize how the tracking system keeps the poor people and minoritis in our society on the bottom while keeping the rich and powerful on the top - who realize the dangr of teaching complete obedience to authority and who are fed up with the racism and sexism in schoos. It is written for students who have 'gone through channels' trying to correct these problems and ho are tired of helplessly waiting while the schools destroy more and more minds each day. It is writen for young people who realize that because they are trapped in school they don't have a chance tolearn what they need to know to create a free and good life.
 
  Before trying any of the ideas in here you should think about the effect they will have in view ofthe situation in your particular area. Not all of them will be effective at all times in all areas. f you think of other ideas please send them to us so we can print them in future editions.(YIP addres is same as
Overthrow mag. in general section -sysop II)

           WHAT YOU CAN DO
----------------------------------------
1. Get a syringe [minus needle] or similar device. Mix both tubes of epoxy glue with a little rubbin alcohol. You now have about half an hour to fill locks -door jams -etc. before glue hardens. If youcan't get the epoxy glue and syringe a tube of airplane cement can also be used although it is not a permanent.

2. An alternative use for the syringe is to pretend to shoot up while a teacher is watching. If theyspeak to you tell them you have to do it because school is so horrible.

3. Call the school and leave the phone off the hook. The way some [but not all] phone systems work tis will tie up their phone for as long as yours is off the hook. 

4. Protest U.S. aid to reactionary regimes abroad by defoliating plants around the school or by diggng a bomb crater on the front lawn. When the ecology freaks complain ask them where they were when te U.S. was doing the same thing to Indochina.

5. Draw or paste something 'obscene' on pull-down wall maps or movie screens.

6. Get some of the punch cards that your school uses for taking attendance. Punch new holes in them ither with a keypunch machine or a screwdriver. Then switch the cards with others wherever they are tored. If you can figure out the code the cards are punched by this has even more possibilities. Youcan often be just as effective without actually repunching the cards by redistributing them a few das after you collect them [particularly when they're used for attendence]. 

7. Start an information service to let new students opinions and warnings about the teachers and admnistrators before enrollment day.

8. Bad food? Have a good old fashioned food riot.

9. In gym classes or in hallways between classes have massive searches for 'lost' contact lenses teling people not to walk through the hall or 'you might step on it'.

10. If your school still has a dress code protest it having everyone do something disruptive that dos not violate the code. For example dye your hair green with food coloring. 

11. Free all the animals in the biology classroom.

12. Write a 'consumer report' on the 'education' you've been consuming. Distribute it to parents at chool functions.

13. Periodically have students go to the office to have some rumor confirmed or denied.

14. Perform citizen's arrests of administrators for destroying the minds of youth then telephone thepolice to come and take the criminals into custody. [This would be an excellent guerilla theatre acton].

15. Rip off dishes and silverware from the cafeteria -towels from the gym -stencils and paper from te duplicating room -layout equipment from the art and drafting departments -tools from the wood shopand light bulbs from the sockets. Give them to a needy movement group.

16. During lunch turn on and light all the gas jets in the science labs.

17. Demand to see your school records on file. [Everyone can see them.]

18. You can make a very effective fuse by inserting a non-filter cigarette in a book of matches so tat it touches the head of some matches and will ignite them when it burns down that far. Then looslycrumple paper around the matches and cigarettes so that they are hidden. Toss it in a wastebasket orany other area with a lot of papers preferrably in the office. It takes 5 minutes to ignite - by the you can be on the other side of the building. Practice this at home before trying it.

19. Have giant coughing or sneezing epidemics in class or study hall.

20. Rub lipstick -glue -vaseline -or shit onto the doorknobs of the school's administrative offices.
21. Swallow some snake bite antidote then walk into the principal's office. The antidote [most typesare harmless - make sure you get that kind] will make you vomit. Do so all over his carpet -desk -clthing -etc. then apologize profusely.

22. Pick up some dog training liquid at any pet store - it smells like concentrated piss. And if youcan't figure out what to do with that then you shouldn't be reading this.

23. Remove contents of teacher's mailboxes. Print up everything that's confidential or interesting.

24. Leave notes and hints that 'Tuesday's the day'.

25. Impersonate parental voices and make irrate phone calls to the office.

26. Make a super stink bomb out of Hydrogen Sulfide and put somewhere in the ventilating system. Thi has cleared school buildings for days.

27. If your school has a suspended ceiling[that is a ceiling composed of rectangles or squares restig on a frame so that the rectangles can be pushed up] you can put a dead fish -or anything else -aboe them. Or put it into empty lockers and glue them shut. 

28. Put signs on your locker saying 'this locker will self-destruct if opened for inspection'. 

29. Give your school library a subscription to a good underground newspaper from your area and insis that they make it available to students.

30. Print up false notices frequently using the same format as the school uses and distribute them t the teachers' mailboxes. Eventually they'll never know what to believe. 

31. Make your own passes -forms -tickets -etc. -or lift them out of teachers' desks. 

32. Need a signature? Collect things that have teachers' signatures on them. Paste them all down on  sheet of white paper and either xerox or print up a bunch of copies. Forge when useful. [When gettig started you might put a piece of carbon paper under the signature with the carbon paper facing dow on what you want signed. Then trace over the name with a steady relaxed hand. Practice makes perfec.]

33. Do some revolutionary wall painting. All you need is a can of 
spray paint [red?] plus a little imagination and courage. Then write your favorite slogans on walls sidewalks -blackboards -etc. If you are a perfectionist you can make a stencil -but that limits the ize of what you can do. WEAR GLOVES or you will certainly get tell-tale paint on your spraying finge. 

34. Are certain teachers or administrators misbehaving? Print up a rat sheet with their names and teephone numbers and distribute it. Now students can call up at any time and reprimand them - 3.00 A.M for example. Also you could order them pizzas -plumbers -think big!

35. Break into your school at night and burn it down. To get inside you can either hide in the buildng during the day and wait until the janitor leaves [know in advance what time that is]-or come in lter at night and either force your way through the door -find an open window -or break a window [seeMonroe Mindfuck]. If you use the latter method do it a few hours or days in advance so you don't getcaught if it attracts attention. Be careful not to leave fingerprints - wear gloves all the time if ossible. Once inside make sure the walls will light well by placing loose paper or wood around them or squirting lighter fluid -kerosene -or gasoline onto them. If a lot of burnable boxes are stacked n one area spread them around. Start the fire from the inside of the building so it will take longerbefore it can be seen from the windows. Make sure the fire has a way to travel from one burnable are to another. Of course you should wear dark clothes and know exactly where you are going when you spit.

36. Get hold of a film to be shown at a school assembly and splice in parts of another movie of yourown choosing before the assembly. A little imagination on your part will make for an unforgettable dy.

37. Clog up the drains of sinks with clay then turn on the water after everyone leaves school. 

38. Teachers often leave gradebooks -conduct sheets -and attendance records unguarded. Take every chnce to help yourself. 

39. Put up posters all around the school. To make them stick permanently use Pet evaporated milk forglue.

40. You could ice-pick tires as a warning - but make sure you have a total enemy before you put suga in their gastank. 

41. Start wailing in the halls

42. If you can't find any skunks -let chickens loose in the school -or pigeons.

43. Creat the 'WEB OF THREAD' in your classroom. Have everybody in your class bring a spool of threa - with extras for people who forget. Tie your thread onto something and pass the spools around tillyou run out - winding thread around everything. [It is best to pick on one of your more dullwitted tachers for this one]. Explain that you did it in the name of art.

44. Carry and pretend to sell oregano rolled in papers and aspirin with the name filed off.

45. Put Calcium Carbide [available in some parts of the country as 'Gopher-Go', also available in soe hobby and joke shops] in a gelatin capsule and flush down a toilet or sink. Calcium Carbide reactsviolently with water -quickly producing large amounts of gas and bursting pipes -etc. as soon as thewater dissolves the capsule.

46. Ride a bicycle down a busy hall.

47. Save your book reports and essays. Give them to other students to use next year or re-use them yurself with different teachers.

48. Play with lighting and microphone controls during 'important' assemblies.

49. Flush things down the toilets [preferably faculty johns] like 
balloons filled with air -baseballs -M80's -huge amounts of toilet paper -etc. Then build an ark.

50. Start a campaign to have the letter Z appear everywhere as the mark of angry students.

51. You can short-circuit the school's wiring by taking a regular plug with a short cord attached -cnnect the 2 wires with a switch between them. Plug it in -turn the switch on -and you've blown a fus. Turn it off -pull it out -and try another. You don't have to use the switch -but if you don't someimes the current will arc and weld the plug to the socket.

52. Set up a fake school and hire away the lousy teachers - or put up notices inviting the entire scool to a going away party for a teacher who isn't really leaving.

53. Read the school budget. Reprint and distribute a list of the stupid expenditures.

54. Take booze to lunch in a thermos and pass it around. 

55. During some important test [SAT/ACT/etc.] on each subject have some student who is good at that ubject stand up and read the correct answers for as long as possible. When they're finished or silened have someone else stand up and do the same thing. The test results will be worthless and it will ave to be given over at great cost to the school.

56. Take down the American flag in front of the school and put up one of your own. The best way to d this is to lower the flag that's already up replace it with your flag and cut the rope about a footbelow where the flag is attached. Then tie a slip knot around the other end of the rope that is hangng down to raise the flag. At this point there is no way your flag can be lowered without someone clmbing up the flagpole.

57. Put alarm clocks in various lockers set on 'loudest'. Set the alarm clocks so they will go off aout every 10 minutes then close and lock the lockers.

58. Have a group of people march around the school with a flag singing the Star Spangled Banner. If he administration tries to punish you telephone your local radio stations and patriotic groups and cmplain that your school is being run by pinkos.

59. In a class where there is a rule against chewing gum have everyone blow a bubble at the same tim one day.

60. Many schools have automatic sprinkler systems which go off automatically when sensors in the ceiing feel too much heat. Find the sensors and hold up a match to them. 

61. Persuade the graduating class to use their senior gift money for something useful or subversive.
62. Reprint School Stoppers Textbook in your underground paper or on a leaflet or buy bulk copies an pass them around.

63. Demand that all equipment being stored rather than being used be made available to students. 

64. If your school won't have a teacher evaluation make up some forms and do it yourself. Compile th result and publicize them to students -faculty -school board -and community. 

65. Use your 'free choice' book reports -term papers -etc. to read revolutionary literature and furter the political education of you and your class. 

66. Have a student lie on the ground. When a teacher comes scream 'he jumped' and point to the roof r third floor window. Mumble 'Fred dared him' or 'Maybe it was LSD.'

67. Make an address list of disliked adults in your school. Answer sex ads for them - or order them  few gross items [C.O.D. of course].

68. Toss handfuls of BB's on the floors of busy halls -assemblies -graduation ceremonies -weddings -unerals.

69. Steal cafeteria trays or plates -burn large holes in them -and turn them into the school washer aying 'I guess the food did it'.

70. Leave phony letters of resignation from teachers or administrators on the principal's desk.

71. Get a small group to always carry screwdrivers and slowly dismantle the school.

72. Lots of bomb scares tend to break up the boredom especially during exams or on beautiful days.

73. Photograph teachers and administrators constantly - even without film.

74. If you've got the nerve piss in your pants while giving an oral report.

75. Splice into your school's intercom system [from a remote hidden spot]. Now you have your own gueilla radio station. Play on!

76. Drop large bottles of ether in science class.

77. Hang your teacher! Hang a hangman'snoose from a tree - make a dummy and hang the dummy from the oose. Pin notes on it like 'Weatherbee in '73.' To add realism put holes in the body then let diluteketchup trickle down. 

78. Newspaper stands in buildings are usually left unguarded. Take out papers and replace with rotte comics or papers.

79. Put a rotten apple or stale sandwich on teacher's desk.

80. If your school intercom has phones that connect into the intercom switch-board -put a small magnt either where the cord comes out of the handset or in the part where you hear. If the
intercom just has a speaker -put the magnet near or on one of the electrical connections of the speaer. In either case it will short out the system. It may take weeks for them to find the trouble.

81. Take the door of the administration offices off its hinges but leave it standing there so that wen the principal tries to open the door in the morning it will have a slightly crushing effect.
