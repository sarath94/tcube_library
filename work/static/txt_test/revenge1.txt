             This text was taken from the book Make 'em Pay by George
           Hayduke.  If you are a truly spiteful person and like
           revenge this book is for you.


                        THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REVENGE.

           1. Thou shalt not trust, nor confide in, anyone!

           If you do, that person could eventually betray you.  Even
           if it is a relative or spouse, don't tell them what you are
           up to.  Implicated accomplices are OK.


           2. Thou shalt never use thine own telephone for revenge
              business!

           Always use a public telephone, or an unwitting mark's
           (target), so calls cannot be traced back to you, or someone
           who knows you.

           3. Thou shalt not touch revenge documents with thy bare
              hands!

           Bare hands leave fingerprints!  Wear gloves.

           4. Thou shalt become a garbage collector!

           Once your victim places his garbage outside his home/office
           for pickup, it is 100 percent legal for you to pick it up
           yourself.  You can learn about your victim by sifting
           through his trash.  The pros do it all the time.

           5. Thou shalt bide thy time before activating a revenge
              plot!

           Give the victim time to forget about you and what he has
           done to wrong you.  Getting even to quickly makes it easier
           for him to discover who is doing it.

           6. Thou shalt secure a "mail drop" address in another city!

           You don't want revenge mail being traced back to your
           residence/town, do you?

           7. Thou shalt learn everything there is to learn about thy
              victim!

           The best revenge schemes/plans are hatched by people who
           now their victim better than their victim does.

           8. Thou shalt pay cash all the time in a revenge plot!

           Checks, money orders, etc., can be traced back to you. Cash
           cannot!

           9. Thou shalt trade with merchants who have never heard of
              you!

           Do business with people only once when involved in a
           revenge plot.  Possibly wear a disguise so they will have
           trouble identifying you in a legal confrontation.

           10. Thou shalt never threaten thy intended victim!

           Why warn your intended victim that you are going to get
           even?  When bad things begin to happen to your victim,
           whether or not you caused them, your victim will remember
           your threat, and he'll set out to even the score with you.
