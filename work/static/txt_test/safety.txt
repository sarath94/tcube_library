Safety Precautions
------------------
        More people, young and old, political and apolitical, have executed
themselves with some form of explosives than I would care to state here. The
safety procedures for all explosives are nothing more than common sense and
reasoning. Yes, smokeless powder is stable, but if you put it in the oven, it
will explode. That may sound stupid, but a 14-year-old in Ohio did it a few 
years ago and killed himself. Plastique is a very stable compound, but it
needs to be softened before use. Some guy in New Jersey softened his plastique
with a hammer, and he is no more. TNT can be burned and it will not explode -
most of the time - whereas gunpowder will ignite with the smallest spark.
Don't be stupid. Make sure you know what you're getting into before you get
into it.
