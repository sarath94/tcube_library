By using the method described in this file, you can get free drinks or
free money, or quite possibly free drinks AND free money.

What do I mean by, 'Salt a box?' you ask?  The term is quite literal.
Listen up!

Here is a list of the stuff you will need to salt a box:

     - a big jug, like an empty gallon milk jug, maybe two
 
     - lots of salt, like several pounds (really cheap, like 5 cents a can)

     - some warm water

     - a piece of poster board or something to make a BIG funnel with

     - a couple of nice, strong bags to hold your money anr/or drinks in
       like gym bags or something

     - a soft drink machine in a place where you can rip it off without
       anyone seeing you  (it's your choice, make a good one)

Take your jug and fill it with the warm water and salt.  Mix it up real
well so that the salt dissolves as much as it can into the water.

Fold the poster board (or whatever you use) into a funnel so that you can
direct the flow of a liquid where ever you want it.

Go up to your drink machine and hold the end of the funnel up to the COIN
slot of it.  Now slowly pour as much salt water into the machine as you
can.  The more the better.  If you are lucky, you will short the machines
electronics out.  You will do one or more of the following to the machine:

     - cause it to 'free vend,' or dispense drinks simply by pushing the 
       selection you want without the insertion of money

     - cause it to spit out all the change that the machine holds in its
       changer  (about $30 in a machine with a dollar bill validator and
       about $15 in one without the validator) 

     - cause the machine to simply screw up and make for lots of repair
       bills, problems and headaches for the drink company  (good if you
       are pissed at the machine or company) 

If it does start spitting coins, be prepared to wait a while, because it
will take a pretty good while to dispense all the coins.  It will spit out
coins at the rate of about 1 or 2 a second, and it makes a lot of noise,
so choose you location wisely.

Now for a bit of science.  Why use salt water instead of regular tap?
Despite popular belief, pure water does not conduct electricitry.
In order for water to conduct electricity, there must be at least trace
amounts of ions in it.  When you dissolve salt in water, the sodium and
chlorine molecules break their ionic bonds and the the free ions float
about the solution, allowing the free conduction of electricity.
See there?  You just learned something!

This method DOES work.  It may not give money, or drinks ALL the time.  In
fact, you may end up just frying the machine, but it will work sometimes.

Please be aware of the fact that there are always changes being made in
technology every day to keep people from ripping other people/machines off.
There is an add-on part for drink machines that will direct the flow of
water to the bottom of the machine, while allowing the coins inserted into
the coins slot free access to the coin mechanism, but it is not standard
for drink machines at this time.

This method may also work for other types of vending machines.  Try it!
