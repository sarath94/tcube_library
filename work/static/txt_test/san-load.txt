This is a phile on making cigarette loads.  Keep in mind explosives are
dangerous and should be handled with care.
Requirements-
Sodium Azide
Lead Nitrate
Balsa wood slivers (approx. 3/8" to 1/2" by 1/8" to 1/4")
Filter Paper
Distilled Water
Gum Arabic Glue

What is a load?  A load is a small explosive which will shred a cigarette and
produce a sharp cracking sound when the cigarette is lit.  It is placed in the
tobacco end of the cigarette and, if made and inserted properly, causes no
harm (except to the cigarette) on ignition.
Here's what you do:
Dissolve about 1 gram Sodium Azide in distilled water.  Don't use more water
than you need.  Then dissolve about 3 grams Lead Nitrate in water, again using
only as much as you need.  Slowly pour the lead Nitrate solution into the
Sodium Azide solution, stirring as you pour.  A white substance will settle in
the bottom.  Pour out the water, and filter the white stuff (Lead Azide) with
distilled water several times.  Remember, the filter paper has enough lead
azide on it to make it explosive.  You should store what you don't need wet to
keep it from accidentally detonating.  Mix enough gum arabic glue to make the
stuff stick, then dip the balsa wood in it.  Leave them to dry for about a day,
then test one out (NOT IN YOUR MOUTH!!!).  You should stick it in so the end of
the sliver is just barely visible.  When the cigarette is lit, the paper at the
end should be shredded.  If you put it in right, the victim has just enough
time to take a drag before it explodes.
Don't store a lot of lead azide in a container.  Put a gram in a plastic
container that won't shatter.  Make sure you wipe the lip before closing the
jar.  You can put just enough water in the jar to cover the stuff, but don't
put in the glue until you are ready to apply it.
If you don't put the load in far enough, it will send cinders flying.  I've
seen them cause considerable pain by getting in someone's eye, so make sure you put it in right.
