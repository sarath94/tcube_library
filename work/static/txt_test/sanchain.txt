==EXPLANATION==        
===============        
        This file will describe one of many ways to pick a chain lock.  A      
chain lock is one of those locks, usually used in hotels and homes for added 
security, that is connected to the wall by the door and strung across the 
crack between the door (the side with the knob) and the wall.  On the door 
there is a track that the knob on the end of the chain slides in.  When the 
door is opened (with the lock locked) it is held back by the chain leaving
a minimal amount of room (3-4 in.) allowing things like an eye (to see who's
there), an arm (most arms), a gun, a small pipe bomb, etc... to get through. 
This opening can be taken to YOUR advantage when you use the extremely simple 
device I intend to teach you to make.

============
==CREATION==
============
        When you read this part you will smack yourself and say 'That's easy!
Why didn't I think of that?'.  The materials you need are as follows:
        =  A wire-frame coat hanger (the kind totally made of wire, not the 
                                     ones with that cardboard tube)
        =  Long-nose pliers (if you don't have any then hands MIGHT work)
        =  A chain lock to pick. (duh)
        Now if you know how chain locks work you will realize that you can't
just squeeze your arm through the crack and release it, you must have the 
door closed, or almost (about 1/4 in.) closed to slide it off the track.  
So with the coat hanger you will slide it off.  Now unravel the wire and 
and make the coat hanger into a straight line with only those wiggley things
on the end.  Then bend the coat hanger to look sorta like the diagram:
    
    |~~~~||
 Handle  \/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \
Catch-->   ~)_______________________________________ /  

And with the pliers bend the wiggley end (catch) of the line to this:
   
   (~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  __)

=========
==USAGE==
=========
        Now the Catch is used to catch the knob on the end of the cain and 
then push it out of the track. So the operation is simple, you just slip your 
arm through the hole with the end with the catch in your hand.  With your

=USAGE=CONT'D=    pg. 2

fingers, try to hook the catch on to the ring of the chain that is connected
to the knob or even hook it to the knob itself.  Then, close the door and 
slide the device toward the hinges of the door and when it goes no farther 
wiggle it a bit.  Then push the handle toward the door to knock the knob out
of it's track.  Now you simply open the door and the chain should not be 
there anymore.

========
==TIPS==
========
        When using this you might want to try different techniques in opening
the lock.  You could tape it to the lock or connect a rubber band to the knob 
then the other end of the band to the catch for maybe a wider movement range.
There are many things you might want to do to make it easier and by all means
improve it if you can and even sell it if you want.  Also if you want to just
find a way to get in touch with me and suggest!
