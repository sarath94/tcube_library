             Plastic Cherry Bombs- A Theoretical Method of Manufacture

   I have heard rumors of special cherry bombs available on the black market that had a plastic red case (as opposed to the rock-hard case in
traditional cherry bombs).  This sounds like a desirable safety measure, because it eliminates the dangerous shrapnel of a traditional case.  This was
not the only difference, however.  Reports of their strength show that the explosive couldn't possible be the same relatively mild flash powder in
ordinary cherry bombs.  I heard once that someone took one and put it in a crevasse in a concrete house foundation and lit it.  The bomber claims that
it blew a 6" hole in the cement.
   The strength of the bomb, which was supposedly no larger than an ordinary cherry bomb leads me to believe that it used a high explosive, such as
C-3 or C-4.  Other high explosives such as mercury fulminate (the only one I have any experience with) couldn't do that much damage.  C-4 is almost
impossible to find now, but it was more common in past days (around the mid-sixties).  That could explain why I've never seen or heard of one except
from pyros who were growing up in the 60s.  Though I've never seen or used it, I know a little about how C-4 works, so I have a general idea of how
the plastic cherry bomb might have been designed.  Red plastic cups (like the wooden cherry bomb cups of the past) might be filled with C-4, with
a blasting cap attached to commercial fuse in the middle and cemented together.  The fuse wouldn't be enough to detonate the plastic explosive, so the
bomb wouldn't detonate until the fuse reached the blasting cap and the cap detonated the explosive.
   It is hardly nessacary to say so, because it isn't likely that anyone reading this phile could get hold of the materials to build it, but I
strongly suggest that, if you DO happen to have a little C-4 laying around, you don't try this.  The design is based entirely on speculation and,
it is quite possible that I have overlooked some critical aspect of the materials involved that could cause spontanious detonation, poisionous fumes,
hairy palms, blindness, impotency, etc., etc.  If you do try it, I assume no responsibility for whatever happens.
   That just about wraps this one up.  Watch for more philes (including a new surveillance series) by,
