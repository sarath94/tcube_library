     One of the hardest things for new members inducted into the computer
underground to do is finding places where they can buy ( "buy" - I use the
term loosely) the phone equipment, software, chemicals, books, etc. that
they need, to carry out whatever their minds might dream up.  To aid these
virgin youths in their plight I've compiled and expanded a list of sources
that is the largest I've ever known to be made.  Naturally there is always
room for improvement so if there is anything that anyone out there cares to
ad to the list just drop a note to one of SANctuary's distribution sites or
anywhere else you might stumble upon me (you will of course get
credit for the items you donate) so it can be added to forthcoming
versions.

phrackers.  $22.95

what other, more experienced people are talking about.

These people, headed by Mitch Kapor - the writer of Lotus 1-2-3, help to
defend the rights of hackers and members of the computer underground.
Steve Wozniak is also active with this group I believe.  Steve, the founder
of Apple Computers, happened to get enough money to start his company by
selling blue boxes door-to-door at UC Berkeley where he attended college.

There are many other articles in legit magazines around (i.e. Esquire,
Newsweek, Time, etc.)  Just look up "Computer Crime" in the periodical
encyclopaedias or whatever in the library.  You will be surprised by the
amount of stuff around.  But keep in mind that they are "above" ground
publications (or whatever you'd like to call them) so that is the type of
material you will be reading.  Time Magazine doesn't often publish articles
on how to build a beige box.  As for the magazines/journals/catalogs/et
cetera I've listed, I didn't have the time to check out every single item
listed cause frankly, I've got a life to live.  So some of them may have
gone down, or out or simply fallen of the face of the earth, others may
have had rate and subscription price changes, while new ones may have
popped up to replace the deceased ones.  So if anyone has anything new to
add, whether it be of new magazines popping their heads up, or to say that
some magazine no longer publishes, or just to declare a rate change, it
will all be greatly apreciated as well as acredited.
