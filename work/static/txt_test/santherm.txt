             Thermite Bomb!!!
   By -+-NaTaS-+-

	Ok,by reading the above intro type thingie you must have figured the
following:A.Your parents most likely dont want you to have such info,B:The
fedz dont want you to have it either,C:If you take this outside your living
quarters,dont take it to school,even now a days teachers will percieve this
type of info as being harmful to the school enviorment.But what do I have to
say about it,easy,FUCK ALL Y'ALL.Its a free country there is something called
FREE SPEECH,so if they dont like this stuff,I DONT CARE.But let me do the
saftey procedures:This file is made for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.Once
this file is into somebodys hands,it is not my fault what they do with it.
	Ok,That crap done with lets get to the goods.My handles are up there
so you know who i am,at least i hope.Anyway lets start out with a brief intro
(oh mannn).I specialize in Explosive Devices (things that make you go....
GOD DAMN!!),Remote Detonation,Incendiares,And some Communication Skills,mroe
about those later.This is a demo file for SANctuary so I am pouring my heart
out here,NOT!!!
	Enough stalling,what we are going to learn today kids is how to make
something called THERMITE.Now some might say "Gee Wilbur,What in tarnation is
thermite?"Well thermite is a substance that allows it users to melt through
almost anything.Now this is long and dull,and the chemicals are hard to get,
but if you are a lucky one,you will get them,and you will be able to witness
the power of this stuff.Now just for saftey reasons (yes,i do care about you)
let me say that this stuff is PROVEN to work.I have a hole in an old car to
prove it.When this crap burns,it burns HOT!!!.Now this stuff is also hard
to ignite so i guess i will have to explain how to make sub-igniter for it.

OK,ENOUGH CRAP,MATERIALS,TAKE NOTES KIDDIES!!!

Materials for Thermite:
-----------------------
Aluminum Powder,No coarser than coffe grounds!!
Iron Oxide Flakes (Fe3O4,Simialr to coarse ground coffe)

I.Place three parts by volume of iron oxide and two parts by volume of
aluminum powder into the jar.If you aint got a jar,GO GET ONE,NOW!!Leave
enough empty space to faciliate mixing.
II.Tighten lid on jar,turn the jar on its side and slowly roll until the two
powders are completely mixed.The mixture is now ready for use and may be stored
for months in the sealed container.Easy?? Yes,Lets Continue,Shall We!

Materials For Sub-Igniter:
--------------------------
Either aluminum or magnesium fillings or powder,no coarser than granulated
sugar.
Any one of these oxidizing agents:Sodium Dichromate,Potassium Permanganate,
Potassium Nitrate,or Postassium Dichromate,No coarser than granualted sugar.

I.Using a clean,DRY spoon,place one of the metal powders or fillings in the
container (seperate from the Thermite itself) to one-third conatainer volume.
If metal filings are used,they had BETTER be free of grease!!
II.Wipe the spoon clean and add an equal quanity of one of the oxidizing 
thingies i mentioned.
III.Tighten the lid on the mixing container,turn the container on its side and
slowly roll until the two powders are completely mixed.The mixture is now ready
for use and storage.
	
	Ok,Now that you have these two mixtures in TWO SEPERATE CONATINERS,its
time to get to the lighting of this stuff.But first,before you light it you 
need to learn how to make this into a hole burning type thingie,but I will 
explain that,next phile,JUST KIDDING,i want to make this worth your while,so
here we go.Now lets get something straight i have only tested this using 3/8
inch of structural steel.

Preperation:
------------
	Cut a carboard can (that has metal ends) into two EQUAL sections.If you
need a can try somethy like Ajax or Bon Ami cleaner.One section of the can 
should be trimmed to a height of 2 inches,and two side vents are cut into it.
Then the other section of the can should be filled 2/3 full of thermite.After 
the thermite is in,it should be compltely covered with the sub igniter to a
depth of at least 1/4 an inch.Then get yourself a fuse cord and stick it in.
Having trouble following this,dont worry,i will draw (hehe) a picture for you.
Ok so basically by now you should have a can with metal ends cut into two equal
halves.One trimmed down with two side vents and the other with the thermite and
igniter.and a fuse stickin out the top.Now when you place this on your target,
make sure that the half with the vents,is facing down,and the side with the
thermite is facing up (derrr).Both metal ends should be touching.

Picture Pages:

The following is what this should look like if you did this right:

                                       \
    				       /
				       \   <=-Fuse (der)
				       /

NOTE:Those noctches should be on OPPOSITE sides of the can.

	Ok,you now know how to make thermite and sub-igniter,dont you feel
like you have accomplished something.Let me warn you.This stuff burns like 
hell itself.If it will go through steel,i am almost certain it will go through
your hand.Dont try to play MACHO and tell your girlfriend that you will hold
this stuff as it melts,there would definately be a hot time in the old town
that night.Well thats about it for me,but because i am feeling so good let me
give you a little tidbit.

Tidbit:
-------
Nitros Starch:Classification:Secondary High Explosive
Composed of:
Starch Nitrate
Barium Nitrate
Sodium Nitrate
Notes:I dont know hom much of what goes in to making the stuff,but i can tell
you that this stuff is more sensitive to heat,friction,and sparks than TNT,
but less powerful.Think you can get your hands on the material,be my guest,
want to try and make this stuff,be my guest.test it for all i care.If you do 
decide that you have nine lives and test it,let me know if you get the right
amounts of everything!!

Future Projects:
----------------
	Well this is my first SANphile and if it makes it I hope this info is
of some use to you.Right know i am working on a TOTALLY PHREAK CELLULAR.I have
a old cellular and based on past experiences and experiments,i am currently
working on making it a phreak phone.So far success is minimal due to the fact
that i am waiting for a company to deliver some stuff so i can program what I
want,and due to the fact that I am trying to find the correct power input level
 without frying the damn phone.If all goes well it will be done by the end of
this year,THIS IS NO EASY TASK.So so long for know.If you need help on any of
this stuff, Call HELLIFRE! (SAN World HQ) 908-495-3926 and e-mail
Chris Buchanon....    Adios!!!
