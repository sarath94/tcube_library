     So, your'e a little short on cash, and you wish you had a little more. Here are some of my favorite tricks for taking money away from your fellow human beings.

I. Red & Black.
       This one is real simple. Find someone who likes to gamble and who has a little dough burning a hole in his trousers. Get a deck of cards and let him shuffle it so he knows you haven't stacked the deck. Then say to him "OK, here's the deal. I'll turn over two cards. If they're the same color, I'll give you a dollar, if not, you give me a dollar. Deal?"
     
     The average moke will think that since there are an equal number of black and red cards in the deck, he has a 50-50 chance of winning. Wrongo! Let's say the first card is red. If the next card is black, you win, if it's red, you lose. However, with one red card missing, there are 26 black cards in the deck and only 25 red cards, giving you a roughly 52% chance of winning! While this may not seem like much, if you play 20-30 rounds of this, the odds are very good that you will walk away with more money than him. Or, if you think you have a REAL sucker on your hands, offer him 15 times his bet if the two cards have the same face value. He will probably conclude that since there are 13 cards to a suit he has a 1 in 13 chance of winning and will jump at the chance to get rich; in actuality he has a 1 in 17 chance of winning and YOU will be the one getting rich.



II. How much can you eat?
         To pull this scam, go to the fattest kid on campus. Bet him twenty bucks that he can't eat a dozen donuts at one sitting. Since blobbos like that are invariably proud of they're eating ability (since they have nothing else to be proud of) he'll accept the bet.

     Here's the trick. Buy a dozen donuts that are of the dry sort; plain, powdered sugar, cinnamon, etc. Don't get ANY chocolate, jelly/custard filled, ones with moisture. By the time Lardball eats his eighth or nineth donut, he'll be thirsty. Offer him a glass of water, milk, coffee, etc. If he drinks it, he's DEAD! The water will bloat up the dough in his stomach and there is no way in hell that he can eat that last donut. Twenty bucks, please!
