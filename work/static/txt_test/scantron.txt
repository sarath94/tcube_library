We all know what the scan-tron 
is, don't we??????

The scan-tron are those  
little cards with the little bubbles
and rectangles that our precious
teachers expect us to fill in with
those #2 pencils. In the past you
had some machine zap through the
cards only to tell you that you have
failed biology. This meant that mom
and dad are gonna take your computer,
telephone, and nights on the town
and stuff them in their closet, (along
with their kinky toys).

Well, worry no more...
I TIME BANDIT HAS COME
up with a simple, but workable method
to evade those little red slashes that
seem to say "nice try."

***EXPLANATION***

Scan-tron machines detect right or wrong answers by picking up on lead
#2 pencil marks.

If nothing has been marked at all in
the given space, then your answer 
will be marked wrong.  However, if
there is neither a dark pencil mark
nor a blank, the machine will get a
little confused and simply not mark
anything. You might say to yourself,
"Well, what about the score printed
at the end of the test??", to which 
point we respond...

A Scan-tron machine assigns a variable
to the number of possible points
and the number of problems wrong.
Then it subtracts one from the other
and prints the answer at the bottom.
The little red marks beside your
answers represent the number wrong, 
however, if there is no red mark, then
there is simply "nothing wrong" as
far as the machine is concerned.
And we all know that our beloved tea-
chers pay no attention and leave
all the adding to those wonderful
little machines.

***HOW TO AVOID THE RED MARKS***

There are two types of fill sheets
one can receive.  Ones with the 
circles to fill in, and ones with
the rectangles to fill in.

On the ones with the circles, there
is one way to avoid a slash...
IF A CIRCLE IS LIGHTLY SHADED IN,
TOO LIGHT FOR THE MACHINE AND 
TOO DARK FOR THE TEACHER TO QUESTION,
THE MACHINE WILL GET CONFUSED AND
SIMPLY LET YOUR ANSWER BE.
Once again, if there is no mark, the
machine does not subtract from the
total possible, and the teacher
does not notice. Don't get it wrong
though, the computer will mark
a circle that has not been filled in
at all 'wrong'. The only trick is
to lightly fill it in with the cor-
rect tint.

Now for the rectangles...

The same method described for the 
circles will also work for the
rectangle form, along with another
method...
This method is, drawing many diagon-
al light lines through the rectangle.
However, this method is not recommen-
ded because 'teacher' will probably
catch on (some teachers are really
stupid though).

One more note:

Finals are coming.
Start practicing!!!

By the way, this method WORKS.
It's kept me playing sports and
I gotten to keep my telephone,
computer, and social time.

Gnome and I hope this is beneficial
to both you and Harry (ie.your
pecker)
