Part I: Basic Theory of Terrorism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file and its contents are by no means meant for anyone other than the
serious anarchist. By this we mean the person who has been going to school for
at least half of his/her life and then realizing the true worthlessness of the
American school system: i.e., the fact that it represses creativity, destroys
imagination, and screws you up for the rest of your natural life. (Unless you
are the type of person who ENJOYS the school ha what a laugh, in which case
you should throw away this file and go jump off a high place.)
The authors of this file have decided not to put in any sort of disclaimer,
due to the fact that A) Disclaimers are of no use and will not help you
in the least if you are really busted, and B) We don't really care if we are
responsible or not for your actions.  Far from it. As a matter of fact, we
whole-heartedly reccommend them. 

Part II: The Golden Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actually, there are two golden rules to follow when terrorizing a school. One
is that you must do unto others before they do you. Two is that, no matter
what this file reccommends, you will never go wrong if you follow your heart
and use your imagination. These two qualities will be of more use to you
than any file could possibly be.  With that said, let's get going.

Part III: Beginning terrorism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your basic goal is to spread chaos and disorder throughout the entire school,
but the best place to begin is in your own classroom. Here, you will find hall
passes, absence excuse sheets, and many other things that the school uses to
control you. Steal these and give them away. If you're mercenary, sell them.
But do NOT use them yourself! It's very un-anarchistic to profit from this sort
of thing. Your goal is to introduce a thing called FREEDOM, not to make your
life easier like the bloated capitalist pigs who are controlling you...
Changing grades is another thing. You can give that little freshman geek who
sits next to you and gets all A's and sucks up to the faculty a big F. Watch
him squirm. As before, don't give your self an A. Don't even change your own
grade! Everyone else's is fair play.  Besides, that takes suspicion off of
you...
Now for more physical stuff. Krazy Glue has unlimited possibilities when it
comes to school fun. You can glue the teachers' desk drawers shut, or if
you're dexterous enough, glue her body to her chair. Also, glue things to the
walls. We don't mean ordinary things here, we mean stuff like CHAIRS, TABLES
and PEOPLE. (It's one way of mounting your trophies without ruining them.)
Stretch fishing wire across the outside of a classroom door just before the end
of sixth hour on a Friday, and watch the fireworks.

Part IV: Getting Downright Nasty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Coat the insides of peoples' underwear with NAIR hair remover. You will see
quite a lot of uncomfortable faces.  Get some snakebite antidote, making
sure its the "harmless" kind. Drink it all down, walk into the principals'
office, and puke your guts out all over him and his office. Apologize
profusely.
Buy a few family-size bottles of floor wax and empty them all over the halls.
(Make sure to leave yourself a clear space to escape!)
Open up the ceiling and stick dead animals inside.
Open up someone's locker and put LIVE animals inside. For added effect, make
sure they have eaten a while before.

Part V: Bathroom Fun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We were going to put this up there, but we decided that this subject needed a
section of its own. Bathrooms are neat places. Hardly anyone ever uses them
for their intended purpose. Girls use them to gossip, boys use them to smoke,
and we're quite sure they've been used to masturbate on occasion. (Not that we
are accusing either class.) Smoke bombs are fun to use. For a real
treat, get the kind that smell like burning marijuana.
Blow up a balloon, seal it, and flush it down a toilet.
Bring about 50 boxes of JELL-O (tm) to school and fill the toilets with it.
It takes about 30 minutes to solidify if its not stirred (and who's going to
stir it? Not I...) Or, use the toilet without flushing it, and THEN add the
JELL-O.
Write your favorite phrases all over the walls. An oldie but goodie is:
"FUCK THE WORLD! ANARCHY RULES!" Or advertise your favorite musical
group.  Coat the toilet seats with Vaseline or
some equally greasy substance.  Use any kind of bomb to explode the
toilet. See g-files such as CHEMICAL CORNER and HOME DEMOLITIONS for details
on the best compact bombs.

Part VI: Definitely Not for Weaklings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find some way to get into your school at night, and the world is your oyster!
A friend of mine told me how her mother when she was going to high school, got
hold of some pigs, painted the names of some obnoxious faculty members on their
sides, and let them loose in the school to roam and play for the weekend. Those
pigs did EVERYthing and then some. They got shit tracked all through the halls,
they ate up a big shipment of cafeteria food, and in general had a high old
time. Now THAT is what I call classic. Any animal will do as long as it is a
very curious and large one.  If you have the nerve, piss in your
pants while giving an oral report or rehearsing for a play.
Shave your head. Or better yet, shave someone else's head.
Replace the American flag with one of your own devising. Use your imagination
here.  Pretend to sell oregano and aspirin with the name rubbed off at
lunchtime in sight of a teacher.  Pretend to have an epileptic fit.
Get up on top of the school and keep warning them that you'll jump unless
the letter "M" is stricken from the English language.
Pretend to shoot up while being watched by some asshole faculty member.
Ask to make a phone call from a teacher who has his/her own phone in the room.
Phreak with a box that is easily traced and tip off Ma Bell. If Ma doesn't
believe it's a teacher, tell her it's "    " (put in the name of some geek
you despise.)

Part VI: In Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Watch for PART II of the Complete Guide
coming soon.
Don't take any wooden nickels.
Practice what you preach.
Pass this file around and encourage
your friends to do the same.
Give me all your money.

Part I: School Computer Fun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Author's note: The following tricks apply only to the Apple computer when
referencing the slots and internals.

If your school has computers, endless possibilities await you. The disks can
be put in sideways if you are strong, which does incredible wonders for the
reader head, which is now attempting to read off the coarse plastic jacket.
Put disks in upside down.  Most schools will experiment with
various parts of printers, and printers are stupid. One of my favorite tricks
is to feed normal paper into a thermal printer. The result is an incredible
display of fireworks, and the paper is crispy-fried to a beatiful jet-black.
This will vary according to printer type.
Slip a small magnet (we reccommend cobalt, as they are very powerful for
their size) into the disk drive. Let it fall down into the dust catcher where
it will go unnoticed. I don't even need to explain what this one does.
Then there's our old friend Krazy Glue. This wonderful substance will screw up
disk drives more than the school screws you up in a year. Or, gently squeeze a
floppy disk so there is some space to fit something in, and let fall a few
drops of glue. The disk will never spin again.
Play frisbee with disks during lunch hour.
Sector editors can be used to great advantage on school-owned disks. Some
things to do are: Insert a bunch of "Kracked by:" notices and tip off the
software company that the school is using pirated software, put your worst
enemys' name(s) on it and say "Fuck with this disk and you die faggot!!"
Then let a teacher use it. Another favorite of mine which I have
used quite often is to strategically rearrange the cards in the slots. Try
putting the modem card, if there is one into the disk slot and vice versa.
Drop in a metal paperclip on two close diodes. Instant light show.
Can you break into the disk drive? Replace the reader head with either A)
a magnet, or B) an extremely sharp object.
Now for the keyboard: A great source of confusion and one of the least harmful
tricks is to disconnect the keyboard from the rest of the computer. Access
it through the back. On the lower righthand side (when looking down)
is a plug coming from the 'board. Remove this, and if the computer
teacher is dumb (and did you ever know one who wasn't?) there will be a
$500 repair bill come to school.  If you are cruel, and don't have any
table manners, eat a peanut butter and jelly/marshmallow/potato  chip sand-
wich directly over the keyboard. The next user has a major mess to clean up.
Buy the little tabs used for covering electrical wire which have unending
hold on plastic. Place one of them over the larger keys).
This will result in the members of the school not being able
to type, but waste their time trying to figure out which key is which.
The Monitor: If you can get into the side of the monitor, turn the contrast
way down and disconnect the wires that control it. This can be used in any
button: brightness, v-hold, h-hold, etc. Watch the repair money flow out
of the school and into the computer owner's pockets!
And of course there is always just plain blowing the damn things up or
stealing them.

Part II: Underground Newspapers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An underground newspaper can be your best friend if used correctly. To make
and distribute mine, I use a NewsRoom type dealie, make up one copy, and have
it bulk-photocopied for only a penny a page! At that rate, I can sell it for
as much as the regular school paper and still make a profit.
What to have in an underground paper: -Funny stuff. Humorous. This one goes
without saying. Write your own stuff, such as Benny Hill type stuff or satire
or maybe even Monty Python type stuff.  -Advertisements. These can be BBS ads,
coupons if you want to think big, or really just about anything. You can
always rely on the punkers at your school for concert advertisements,
and they will quite possibly ask for a subscription at the same time.
-Anarchy! Also goes without saying.  Stuff such as what we have in here,
chemical corner, The Wild Phreaks' Course in Home Demolitions, or phone
phreaking will be ideal.
-Editorials. Anyone with half a brain can write these, all they have to do is
pick a teacher or faculty member that they absolutely DESPISE, down half a
keg of beer, and wax eloquent on just exactly why such-and-such is the most
incredible dick in the universe. 
How to write:
I personally reccommend NewsRoom for its pictures, as I often have short
stories in my paper. At the bare minimum, however, you will need a good word
processor and a respectable artist to draw in the margins (or full-page car-
toons, as I have done.)

Part III: Spreading the Word
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How to spread the gospel of anarchy:
-Write an essay with spray paint on the
walls of the school (inside or outside)
making sure to wear gloves.
-Pass this file around to all of your
friends that have computers.
-Start up the newspaper and pass that
around for your friends who don't.
-Seize the PA system and produce your
own radio show expounding the virtues
of anarchy.
-Hack a CompuServe account and send
mail to all users with whatever message
you wich to spread.

Part IV: Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well, that's all for now. Until Part 3,
it's goodbye from:

Part One: Hello Again!
----------------------

Yes, once again we have come out of the woodwork to terrorize and spread the
gospel of anarchy throughout the United State's public school system. [Note:
if you go pO! private school, nothing as drastic as what we describe here is
needed. Private schools will surrender much more easily.] We hope you enjoyed
and/or understood the first two files in this series, because it gets worse.
MUCH worse...

Part Two: Disclaimer
--------------------

There is no disclaimer in this file for the reasons stated in Volume One:
A) Disclaimers don't help you in the least if you're busted, and B) we ARE
responsible for your actions, and whole-heartedly recommend them. That's what
we're here for. Just don't get your head blown off, that's all we ask.

Part Three: Basic Nervousness
-----------------------------

Stuff in this category is basically just harmless pranks that let the assholes
know that SOMEone is after their ass, and also gets a good laugh. Taking all
the

doorknobs off the doors is good. But where do you put them? Open up someone's
locker (see the file MASTER LOCK PICKING by Metal Shop for details) and put
them

in there just in case. There is almost nothing more harmless and freaky than to
see no doorknobs anywhere in the school
"At a predetermined time" stuff is old, but still a good idea. There's spitting
during assembly, getting up in the middle of class, walking to the window and
putting your fist through it, or lighting up a cigarette. But you deserve a
break today, so why not make it a joint. Remember: Have EVERYone do this! It
confuses the teachers so they don't know who to bust, and they end up busting
some poor little geek who was sitting in the back row the whole time staring
and drooling. Besides, it's no fun being busted alone.
Does your school use taped announcements? Replace it with something along the
lines of "Satan rules, he will fuck your mothers" at a high volume. Hey, almost
anything will work as long as it's loud, obnoxious, crude, and will get laughs.
I should add here that if it makes the other students (read: prisoners) laugh,
then it's good. Laughter disrupts the faculty and gets them really pissed, they
don't like to see kids having a good time.
Can you get into the air-conditioning system? Pipe gas through it. Chlorine gas
(poisonous; make w/chlorine bleach and ammonia) goes to the teacher's lounge,
laughing gas (nitrous oxide; dentists use it) goes to all the classrooms. Ever
seen a teacher gibber in fear and frustration? I have...

Part Four: Favorite Explosives
------------------------------

Before I get started with this section, I would like to express great thanks
and

appreciation to The Wild Phreak for most of the following information. Merry
Christmas, guy, wherever you are.
Okay, as mentioned in the previous chapter, explosives have a wide variety
of uses. We covered some of them previously, now it#c time to tell you how to
make these wonderful substances.
First off on our list is ignitors. A lot of explosives are 100% useless without
ignitors, as they require a very high temperature to go off. Here are two of
the most basic ones.

Potassium Chlorate/Sugar Ignitor

Materials checklist:

[ ]  Potassium Chlorate
[ ]  Granulated table sugar
[ ]  Measuring container
[ ]  Mixing container w/tight fitting lid
[ ]  Storage container as above
[ ]  Two flat boards, one of which can be held comfortably in the hand, such as
     a square block or rolling pin, and one very large ( 36" x 36" is good.)

Procedure checklist:

[ ] 1.  Spread a handful at a time of the P.C. on the large flat board and rub
        with the other flat board  until the large particles resemble sugar.
[ ] 2.  Measure two parts by volume of granulated sugar into a mixing contain-
        er with a tight-fitting lid, then add three parts by volume of P.C.
[ ] 3.  Secure the lid tightly, and shake the mixture for about five minutes to
        mix thoroughly.
[ ] 4.  Store the ignitor in a waterproof container until ready to use. Before
        using, shake again to remix any settled particles.

*CAUTION* This mixture is extremely spark and flame sensitive. Use accordingly.

Well, we'll come back to this later when I find that stupid printout that I
seem to have misplaced. For now, let's learn all about...

Part Five: Car Disabling
------------------------

For use on the teacher's car, principal's car, janitor's car, etc.

When you do something like this, you do it all the way. You can:

A) Remove a spark plug, fill the cylinder with gunpowder or a similar
substance, and replace the plug. When the car is started, the cylinder blows,
disabling the car until the block is replaced.

B) Go to the store and get a pint of raw linseed oil (cheap). Then, at night,
or at least inconspicuously, open the gas tank and pour the oil in. When the
car is started, the oil travels to the engine, carried by the gas flow. There,
in the intense heat, it breaks down into a thick gummy substance which will
make the car stall. Since this takes about 10-20 minutes of driving to do, it
is impossible to determine when the sabotage was performed.

C) Perform (B) above, using shellac instead of linseed oil. This will so foul
   the engine, combined with the thick, black clouds of smoke rolling from the
   exhaust, that the car looks as if it's about to blow. A little bit of flair
   for you more spectacular types.
   
D) Mostly a minor annoyance, but still fun, is to drop a ping-pong ball in the
   gas tank. Every so often, it gets sucked against the intake and makes the
   car stall. When the car stops, the ball falls away and the car is fine. You
   start the car and drive away, same thing happens...guaranteed to drive the
   average person loony in 30 minutes or less.

E) Take a lot of gas and, using a big syringe, squirt it up the exhaust pipe.
   MAKE SURE IT IS COLD! Then, when the car starts, the gas should ignite and
   cause serious problems to anyone in back of the car. You'd be in trouble,
   too, if huge rockets of flame came shooting out at you...

Sigh...that elusive printout is somewhere here on this desk but I just can't
find it right now! Fuck it, it's almost 2 in the morning and I don't feel like
looking for it anyway. See you in the funny papers.

Until Part Four, its So Long from:

Special Notice: In Volume One, we told you how to clog up toilets with Jell-O.
Well, I have been informed since by Mad Hacker that a substance called Guar Gum
will work fifty times as well. It costs approx. $7.50 a pound, and a pound will
last you half a lifetime. Go to it!

Part One: Greetings
-------------------

Well, it seems we've acquired a loyal following! I've found that of all five
boards I upload this series to regularly, four out of the five request that I
keep it up! We, the authors, thank you for your support, and wish you all a
very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

Part Two: Large-Scale Demolition
--------------------------------

Sooner or later, you get tired of all the old stuff. Your life becomes bland
and boring, totally insipid. Giving snuggies to freshmen slowly seems to be
losing the appeal it once had, and even spiking the prom punch bowl with
arsenic isn't any fun. You have reached the point of no return. There's only
one cure at this point: Blowing up the whole fucking school!

"But whoa!" you exclaim at this point. "If I blow up the school, I won't have
any place to go and do these wonderful things at anymore!"

Well, we say, so what? School is a total waste anyway the way it is now. With
a little bit of luck, you will force the administration to rebuild all schools
for miles around and start over. Until then, we will continue this series in a
slightly different format: "The Complete guide to Terrorism." With that said,
let's blow the fucker into a pile of smoldering rubble.

The best way to go about this, besides nitroglycerin, is Dust Explosives.

A dust explosive is a large area filled with a suspension of a dry, dusty
material that when ignited burns with extreme rapidity, causing a large fire-
ball to occur. When confined, as in a building (like school) the effect is to
blow out the walls and ceiling. The unit described below is sufficient to
completely destroy a 2000 cubic foot enclosure (building 10x20x10 feet). Modify
this as necessary; for larger enclosures, use proportionately larger initiators
and charges (i.e., 1:1? 2:2 or 3:3).

Dust Explosive Initiator:

Material Checklist

[ ] Flat can, about 3" in diameter by 1.5" high. A 6.5 oz. tuna can works well.
[ ] Blasting cap
[ ] Explosive (coming in part 5)
[ ] Aluminum (wire, cut sheet, or powder)
[ ] Large nail (4" long)
[ ] Flour, gasoline, and powdered or chipped aluminum

Procedure Checklist

[ ] Using the nail, press a hole through the side of the tuna can 3/8 to 1/2
    inch from the bottom. Rotate it and lever it around so as to enlarge the
    hole until it can accommodate the blasting cap.
[ ] Place the wooden rod in the hole and position the end of the rod at the
    center of the can.
[ ] When done, remove condom, rolling at ends while removing to reduce chance
    of sperm escaping.
(Whoops! Just wanted to see if you were paying attention...)
[ ] Press explosive into the can, making sure to surround the rod, until it is
    3/4" from the top of the can. Carefully remove the wooden rod so as not to
    disturb the channel it made in the explosive.
[ ] Place the aluminum metal or powder on top of the explosive.
[ ] Just before use, insert the blasing cap into the cavity left by the rod.

The initiator is ready for use.

HOW TO USE:

This particular unit, described to me by the Wild Phreak, works quite well to
ignite charges of 5 pounds flour, 1/2 gallon of gasoline or two pound of flake
painters aluminum. The solid materials may merely be contained in sacks or
card-board cartons. The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated paper milk
cartons, or plastic or glass bottles. The charges are placed directly on top of
the initiator and the blasting cap is actuated electrically or by fuse
depending on the type of cap.

Note: Use flour and gasoline intermixed. The gas insures complete ignition of
      the flour.

Put it all in a cardboard box, and place the box on top of the initiator, with
the charges directly above, or as near as possible.

More [y/n/c]?  The following section is reprinted from the 'School Stoppers Textbook' -a
small section of the 'How to Revolt Handbook' -the fourth book of....
'The Blacklisted News' -available for 13 bucks from the Youth International
Party (Yippies). OK here we go - 83 ways to trash your school.



  Liberate your life - smash your school! The public schools are slowly
killing every kid in them, stifling their creativity and individuality
making them into non-persons. If you are a victim of this one of the things
you can do is fight back.
                
  This chapter is not written for people who are not yet sure whether
school is good or bad. It is written for students that realize the way
that compulsory education and grades destroy the natural curiosity so many
children feel - who realize how the tracking system keeps the poor people
and minorities in our society on the bottom while keeping the rich and
powerful on the top - who realize the danger of teaching complete obedience
to authority and who are fed up with the racism and sexism in schools. It
is written for students who have 'gone through channels' trying to
correct these problems and who are tired of helplessly waiting while the
schools destroy more and more mind seach day. It is written for young
people who realize that because theyare trapped in school they don't have
a chance to learn what they need toknow to create a free and good life.
  
Before trying any of the ideas in here you should think about the
effect they will have in view of the situation in your particular area.
Not all of them will be effective at all times in all areas. If you think
of other ideas please send them to us so we can print them in future
editions.(YIP address is same as Overthrow mag. in general section
-sysop II)

        WHAT YOU CAN DO
1. Get a syringe [minus needle] or similar device. Mix both tubes of
epoxy glue with a little rubbing alcohol. You now have about half an
hour to fill locks -door jams -etc. before glue hardens. If you can't get
the epoxy glue and syringe a tube of airplane cement can also be used
although it is not as permanent.
                
2. An alternative use for the syringe is to pretend to shoot up while a
teacher is watching. If they speak to you tell them you have to do it
because school is so horrible.
3. Call the school and leave the phone off the hook. The way some [but not
all] phone systems work this will tie up their phone for as long as yours
is off the hook.
4. Protest U.S. aid to reactionary regimes abroad by defoliating plants
around the school or by digging a bomb crater on the front lawn. When the
ecology freaks complain ask them where they were when the U.S. was doing the
same thing to Indochina.
5. Draw or paste something 'obscene' on pull-down wall maps or movie screens.
6. Get some of the punch cards that your school uses for taking attendance.
Punch new holes in them either with a keypunch machine or a screwdriver.
Then switch the cards with others wherever they are stored. If you can
figure out the code the cards are punched by this has even more
possibilities. You can often be just as effective without actually
repunching the cards by redistributing them a few days after you collect them
[particularly when they're used for attendence].
7. Start an information service to let new students opinions and warnings
about the teachers and administrators before enrollment day.
8. Bad food? Have a good old fashioned food riot.
9. In gym classes or in hallways between classes have massive searches
for 'lost' contact lenses telling people not to walk through the hall
or 'you might step on it'.
10. If your school still has a dress code protest it having everyone do
something disruptive that does not violate the code. For example dye
your hair green with food coloring.
11. Free all the animals in the biology classroom.
12. Write a 'consumer report' on the 'education' you've been consuming.
Distribute it to parents at school functions.
13. Periodically have students go to the office to have some rumor
confirmed or denied.
14. Perform citizen's arrests of administrators for destroying the
minds of youth then telephone the police to come and take the criminals
into custody. [This would be an excellent guerilla theatre action].
15. Rip off dishes and silverware from the cafeteria -towels from the gym
-stencils and paper from the duplicating room -layout equipment
from the art and drafting departments -tools from the wood shop and light
bulbs from the sockets. Give them to a needy movement group.
16. During lunch turn on and light all the gas jets in the science labs.
17. Demand to see your school records on file. [Everyone can see them.]
18. You can make a very effective fuse by inserting a non-filter cigarette in
a book of matches so that it touches the head of some matches and will
ignite them when it burns down that far. Then loosly crumple paper around
the matches and cigarettes so that they are hidden. Toss it in a
wastebasket or any other area with a lot of papers preferrably in the
office. It takes 5 minutes to ignite- by then you can be on the other side
of the building. Practice this at home before trying it.
19. Have giant coughing or sneezing epidemics in class or study hall.
                
20. Rub lipstick -glue -vaseline -or shit onto the doorknobs of the
school's administrative offices.
21. Swallow some snake bite antidote then walk into the principal's office.
The antidote [most types are harmless - make sure you get that kind] will
make you vomit. Do so all over his carpet -desk -clothing -etc. then
apologize profusely.
22. Pick up some dog training liquid at any pet store - it smells like
concentrated piss. And if you can't figure out what to do with that then
you shouldn't be reading this.
23. Remove contents of teacher's mailboxes. Print up everything that's
confidential or interesting.
24. Leave notes and hints that 'Tuesday's the day'.
25. Impersonate parental voices and make irrate phone calls to the office.
26. Make a super stink bomb out of Hydrogen Sulfide and put somewhere in
the ventilating system. This has cleared school buildings for days.
27. If your school has a suspended ceiling[that is a ceiling composed of
rectangles or squares resting on a frame so that the rectangles can be
pushed up] you can put a dead fish -or anything else -above them. Or put it
into empty lockers and glue them shut.
28. Put signs on your locker saying 'this locker will self-destruct if
opened for inspection'.
29. Give your school library a subscription to a good underground
newspaper from your area and insistthat they make it available to
students.
30. Print up false notices frequently using the same format as the school
uses and distribute them to the teachers' mailboxes. Eventually
they'll never know what to believe.
31. Make your own passes -forms -tickets -etc. -or lift them out of
teachers' desks.
32. Need a signature? Collect things that have teachers' signatures on
them. Paste them all down on a sheet of white paper and either xerox or
print up a bunch of copies. Forge when useful.[When getting started you might
put a piece of carbon paper under the signature with the carbon paper facing
down on what you want signed. Then trace over the name with a steady
relaxed hand. Practice makes perfect.]
33. Do some revolutionary wall painting. All you need is a can of
spray paint [red?] plus a little imagination and courage. Then write
your favorite slogans on walls -sidewalks -blackboards -etc. If you
are a perfectionist you can make a stencil -but that limits the size of
what you can do. WEAR GLOVES or you will certainly get tell-tale paint on
your spraying finger.
34. Are certain teachers or adminis- trators misbehaving? Print up a rat
sheet with their names and telephone numbers and distribute it. Now
students can call up at any time and reprimand them - 3.00 A.M. for
example. Also you could order them pizzas -plumbers -think big!
35. Break into your school at night and burn it down. To get inside you can
either hide in the building during the day and wait until the janitor leaves
[know in advance what time that is] -or come in later at night and either
force your way through the door -find an open window -or break a window [see
Monroe Mindfuck]. If you use the latter method do it a few hours or
days in advance so you don't get caught if it attracts attention. Be
careful not to leave fingerprints - wear gloves all the time if
possible. Once inside make sure the walls will light well by placing loose
paper or wood around them -or squirting lighter fluid -kerosene -or
gasoline onto them. If a lot of burnable boxes are stacked in one area
spread them around. Start the fire from the inside of the building so it
will take longer before it can be seen from the windows. Make sure the fire
has a way to travel from one burnable area to another. Of course you should
wear dark clothes and know exactly where you are going when you split.
36. Get hold of a film to be shown at a school assembly and splice in parts of
another movie of your own choosing before the assembly. A little imag-
ination on your part will make for an unforgettable day.
37. Clog up the drains of sinks with clay then turn on the water after
everyone leaves school.
38. Teachers often leave gradebooks -conduct sheets -and attendance
records unguarded. Take every chance to help yourself.
39. Put up posters all around the school. To make them stick permanently
use Pet evaporated milk for glue.
40. You could ice-pick tires as a warning - but make sure you have a
total enemy before you put sugar in their gastank.
41. Start wailing in the halls
42. If you can't find any skunks -let chickens loose in the school -or
pigeons.
43. Creat the 'WEB OF THREAD' in your classroom. Have everybody in your class
bring a spool of thread - with extras for people who forget. Tie your thread
onto something and pass the spools around till you run out - winding
thread around everything. [It is best to pick on one of your more dullwitted
teachers for this one]. Expalin that you did it in the name of art.
44. Carry and pretend to sell oregano rolled in papers and aspirin with the
name filed off.
45. Put Calcium Carbide [available in some parts of the country as 'Gopher-
Go', also available in some hobby and joke shops] in a gelatin capsule and
flush down a toilet or sink. Calcium Carbide reacts violently with water
-quickly producing large amounts of gas and bursting pipes -etc. as soon
as the water dissolves the capsule.
46. Ride a bicycle down a busy hall.
47. Save your book reports and essays. Give them to other students to use
next year or re-use them yourself with different teachers.
48. Play with lighting and microphone controls during 'important' assem-
blies.
49. Flush things down the toilets [preferably faculty johns] like
balloons filled with air -baseballs -M80's -huge amounts of toilet paper
-etc. Then build an ark.
50. Start a campaign to have the letter Z appear everywhere as the mark of
angry students.
51. You can short-circuit the school's wiring by taking a regular plug with a
short cord attached -connect the 2 wires with a switch between them. Plug
it in -turn the switch on -and you've blown a fuse. Turn it off -pull it out
-and try another. You don't have to use the switch -but if you don't
sometimes the current will arc and weld the plug to the socket.
52. Set up a fake school and hire away the lousy teachers - or put up notices
inviting the entire school to a going away party for a teacher who isn't
really leaving.
53. Read the school budget. Reprint and distribute a list of the stupid
expenditures.
54. Take booze to lunch in a thermos and pass it around.
55. During some important test [SAT/ACT/etc.] on each subject have
some student who is good at that subject stand up and read the correct
answers for as long as possible. When they're finished or silenced have
someone else stand up and do the same thing. The test results will be
worthless and it will have to be given over at great cost to the school.
56. Take down the American flag infront of the school and put up one of
your own. The best way to do this is to lower the flag that's already up
replace it with your flag and cut the rope about a foot below where the flag
is attached. Then tie a slip knot around the other end of the rope that
is hanging down to raise the flag. At this point there is no way your flag
can be lowered without someone climbing up the flagpole.
57. Put alarm clocks in various lockers set on 'loudest'. Set the alarm clocks
so they will go off about every 10 minutes then close and lock the
lockers.
58. Have a group of people march around the school with a flag singing the
Star Spangled Banner. If the administration tries to punish you
telephone your local radio stations and patriotic groups and complain that
your school is being run by pinkos.
59. In a class where there is a rule against chewing gum have everyone blow
a bubble at the same time one day.
60. Many schools have automatic sprinkler systems which go off
automatically when sensors in the ceiling feel too much heat. Find the
sensors and hold up a match to them.
61. Persuade the graduating class to use their senior gift money for
something useful or subversive.
62. Reprint School Stoppers Textbook in your underground paper or on a leaflet
or buy bulk copies and pass them around.
63. Demand that all equipment being stored rather than being used be made
available to students.
64. If your school won't have a teacher evaluation make up some forms and do
it yourself. Compile the result and publicize them to students -faculty
-school board -and community.
65. Use your 'free choice' book reports-term papers -etc. to read revolution-
ary literature and further the political education of you and your class.
66. Have a student lie on the ground. When a teacher comes scream 'he
jumped' and point to the roof or third floor window. Mumble 'Fred dared him'
or 'Maybe it was LSD.'
67. Make an address list of disliked adults in your school. Answer sex ads
for them - or order them a few gross items [C.O.D. of course].
68. Toss handfuls of BB's on the floors of busy halls -assemblies -graduation
ceremonies -weddings -funerals.
69. Steal cafeteria trays or plates -burn large holes in them -and turn
them into the school washer saying 'I guess the food did it'.
70. Leave phony letters of resignation from teachers or administrators on the
principal's desk.
71. Get a small group to always carry screwdrivers and slowly dismantle the
school.
72. Lots of bomb scares tend to break up the boredom especially during exams
or on beautiful days.
73. Photograph teachers and adminis- trators constantly - even without
film.
74. If you've got the nerve piss in your pants while giving an oral
report.
75. Splice into your school's intercom system [from a remote hidden spot].
Now you have your own guerilla radio station. Play on!
76. Drop large bottles of ether in science class.
77. Hang your teacher! Hang a hangman's noose from a tree - make a dummy and
hang the dummy from the noose. Pin notes on it like 'Weatherbee in '73.'
To add realism put holes in the body then let dilute ketchup trickle down.
78. Newspaper stands in buildings are usually left unguarded. Take out
papers and replace with rotten comics or papers.
79. Put a rotten apple or stale sandwich on teacher's desk.
80. If your school intercom has phones that connect into the intercom switch-
board -put a small magnet either where the cord comes out of the handset or
in the part where you hear. If the intercom just has a speaker -put the
magnet near or on one of the electrical connections of the speaker. In
either case it will short out the system. It may take weeks for them to
find the trouble.
81. Take the door of the administration offices off its hinges but leave it
standing there so that when the principal tries to open the door in
the morning it will have a slightly crushing effect.
