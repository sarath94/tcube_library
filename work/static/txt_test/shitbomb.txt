 Shit Bomb
 ----------

 Materials:                   
 1)Fresh feces(a.k.a. SHIT)   
      (looser the better).
 2)M-80.                       
 3)Large baggie.              
 4)Lightbulb.                 
 5)Solar ignitor (optional).  


Instructions:

     Put the fresh feces in a large baggie.  Gently break the covering of a
large wattage lightbulb, but DO NOT disturb the filament inside.  More gently
still, attach the fuse of the M80 to the filament and screw the lightbulb
carefully back into the ceiling socket.  Finally, move the bag of feces up and
around the light fixture.  Make sure the shit does not touch the filament, and
the M80 should should be well into the 'feces'.  Tape the bag to the ceiling.
If the filament breaks, or if you prefer, a solar ignitor can be used to replace
the filament.  This could take more time though due to the process of attaching
the ignitor to the 2 wires to complete a circuit.

MAKE SURE THE LIGHT IS TURNED OFF BEFORE REPLACING THE BULB!!!

     If not...you have about 4 seconds to run your ass off!

When the victim turns on the light switch.....well, let's just say:

               "The shit's gonna hit the fan."
               (and probably everything else!)
