Instuctions on how to make a Shock Bomb:

Materials:
Get a Package of Granulated Shock. (Chlorine pool treatment)  It's only a
couple bucks at your local grocery store.

Sugar

2 Liter Bottle

Water

Instructions:

Get an empty 2 liter bottle (Or you can use almost anysize plastic Bottle)
and make sure that the inside is dry and free of any other residue.

Fill the bottom of the bottle (put in enought just to cover the bottom;
Probably about 1/2 an inch.)  Next, put in a little less amount of Sugar,
probably about 2/5 inch.  Shake the bottle to mix the two chemicals.  

Next, dump in about a cup or so of water, put in enough to make the reaction
happen.  

Next, Cap the bottle, shake for about 2 seconds, and throw it.  Between 1-4
minutes, it should blow up.  Its REALLY loud.  They are great to place in
pumpkins!

Note:  I know this real big fuck up who tried to make one.  He did, but he
didnt wait long enough.  It was about to explode, and he picked it up and
started to shake it somemore.  Next thing you know, it blew up in his face
and he went to the hospital.  He was ok, but everyone at school made fun of
him... Whats even funnier is this:  He got busted by the FBI...  

Be Patient!  Pressure bombs are unpredictable when it comes to time.

Note:  20 oz Coke bottles for some reason tend to react when the shock is
first innitailly dropped in.  I recomen the coke 2 liter bottle or a pepsi 1
liter bottle.
