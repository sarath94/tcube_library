Good Places to Shop Lift
------------------------
     You should steal from open places that have many escapes (for if you get
spotted!). Places like shopping centers, a By-it-self store. That means stores
aren't in shopping centers/malls. I think you get the point there.

How To Act
----------
Ok, you must remmeber these things while shop lifting:
       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       !1) Don't have a Guilty/Suspicious look on your face.  !
       !                                                      !
       !2) Don't look in a hurry, act as you would if you were!
       !   just looking around.                               !
       !                                                      !
       !3) Make sure that where ever you hide it, it is not   !
       !   noticable! Sometimes a piece of software will stick!
       !   out and you will not notice it until after you're  !
       !   caught!                                            !
       !                                                      !
       !4) Don't stay in the store too long! Or else the      !
       !   employees start to wonder.                         !
       !                                                      !
       !5) Don't shop lift at the same store all the time.    !
       !                                                      !
       !6) Don't run or do anything that will attrack the     !
       !   attention of employees/guards.                     !
       !                                                      !
       !7) Don't piss around. Get your shit quickly & casually!
       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


  The people who are supposed to be in stores are shoppers.  Therefore, you
want to blend in so not to be noticed.  Blending in requires you to seem like a
shopper.  If you're not quite exactly sure on the behavioral patterns of a
shopper, spend some time observing them.  Also, try acting odd or figity
(while not attempting to lift anything) to see how employees react & to see
how far you will have to go in your little act.

Thus, the biggest point is ACT LIKE A SHOPPER.


If You Get Caught?
------------------
    Hmm, you messed up ,eh? Oh well...
There's 3 things you can try.

        1) Act real sorry and tell the manager you didn't mean it
           and that you'll never do it again. Try to create some
           tears if possible. There's two things that may happen:

A: He can let you go free.
B: He can press charges & you can pay the fine, or smack him and run! But make
   sure you can get away!

        2) Deni anything he says!

        3) Sit there and pay the fine..

Authoritative figures (fascists!).
----------------------------------

A) Store employees - These should present little problem with confrontations. a
                     smooth bullshitter should be able to talk his way from any
                     such persons.  However, some could be bitchy since some
                     employees have to pay for whats stolen during their shift.
                     Then just bs your way out.

B) Mall Rent-a-cops - These men are complete bastards who will try to make the
                      smallest little thing into a major federal offense.
                      NOTE: Rent-a-cops are the big fatasses who roam the
                      malls with their walkie talkies & plastic sticks
                      (can't have real guns).  Most are old & overweight so
                      you should be able to outrun them but they do have
                      radio but are so unorginzed it really doesn't matter.

C) Local cops - These are touchy.  some are bastards like above, and others
                are quite gullable.  Use your best bullshitting here.

D) State cops - forget it!  staties are bad news.  they are almost completely
                immune to even the best bullshitting.  These guys are smart
                and should never be underestimated.  The best thing to do with
                a state cop is to NEVER lie but try to make your actions sound
                as good and innocent as possible. Since they see alot of really
                major violence/crimes/etc try to make your little mishap sound
                as innocent as possible.  Throw yourself at their mercy & pray
                they let you go somehow.

E) Feds - if you've gotten busted for something so big that these guys show up,
          get a lawyer...


Things to watch for.
--------------------

1) Employees watching you.  If you notice this, & you've got goods hidden away,
   try & get rid of them somehow. Or act like you're comparing similar products
   or like you have a question about that particular product.

2) Reflective looking balls in the ceiling.  this are nasty since there aren't
   always cameras inside, & if there is, you don't know where they're pointed.

3) Cameras & mirrors, naturally.

4) Undercover people or little kids.  Little kids are simply amazed at
   shopplifters.  They will not take their eyes off yo.  This could lead to
   one squeeling, or simply making others aware that somethings not right about
   you thus attracting more unwanted attention.
