THIS IS THE SECOND OF THE NINJA009 SERIES, THE FIRST BEING THE ISSUE: POISON
#1.  I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST BULLETIN AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE
AS WELL...

***WARNING***
AS I KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A LAW THAT PROHIBITS SMOKE SCREENS.  IF
YOU GET CAUGHT SCREENING UP THE STREETS, DON'T MENTION YOUR MENTOR TO THE
COPS.  AND IF YOU WANT TO BE A NINJA, OR JUST A RAD DUDE, DON'T FUCK AROUND
IN THE WRONG PLACES, AT THE WRONG TIME...

BACKGROUND ON SMOKE SCREENS:
----------------------------
SMOKE SCREENS WERE USED BY THE NINJA FOR A WAY OF ESCAPING IN TIGHT SITUA-
TIONS.  THE NINJA HAD TWO TYPES OF SMOKE SCREENS.  ONE THAT REQUIRES A FLINT
AND STONE, AND ONE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY HEAT.  I WILL DESCRIBE THE ONE
WHICH REQUIRES A LITTLE HEAT.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT A HOT DAY IN L.A. ON TOP
OF A BLACK CAR CAN IGNITE THIS SMOKE BOMB.  THE NINJA USED TO CALL THE SMOKE
SCREENS, 'REI SEI NO KIRI', OR SPIRITUAL FOG, OR 'NAGE DAMA' OR HURLED SMOKE.
I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE 'REI SEI NO KIRI' OR SPIRITUAL FOG.  PEOPLE HAVE
THOUGHT OF THE NINJA AS MAGICAL BEINGS, MOST AMERICANS THINK THEY ARE MYTH-
ICAL, BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEARD STORIES FROM FICTIONAL BOOKS.  THE NINJA DON'T
JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR OR WALK THRU WALLS, THEY SPRAY SOME SMOKES TO
HIDE SOME WHERE TEMPORARILY UNTIL THE OPPONENT IS PUZZLED AND LEAVES.  I WILL
DISCUSS SOME OF THESE TECHNIQUES IN THIS ISSUE.


REI SEI NO KIRI
---------------
THE OLD WAY OF PREPARING THE SMOKE SCREEN IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT DAY
THEREFORE, I CANNOT REALLY TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE IT THE OLD WAY.  THE INGRE-
DIENTS OF THE OLD RECIPE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.  BUT I DO HAVE THE ANCIENT
RECIPE AND THE INGREDIENTS.  SINCE I KNOW THAT NONE OF YOU, I REPEAT, NONE
OF YOU CAN GET THE INGREDIENTS TO THE OLD RECIPE, WHICH INCLUDES, AGED AND
FINE POWDERED WOLF DUNG (WHICH MAY BE OBTAINABLE BY SHIPPING VIA CHINA), I
KNOW AS A FACT, THAT IN JAPAN, THEY DO NOT SELL THOSE THINGS, ALSO THE BONES
THE SEA EEL IN POWDERED FORM (WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED IN CHINA, SINCE IT IS
USED FOR MEDICINE DOWN THERE), AND MANY OTHER ODD INGREDIENTS WHICH IS TOTAL-
LY INOBTAINABLE.

-----------
INGREDIENTS
-----------
THIS IS THE INGREDIENTS OF THE NEW RECIPE WHICH DOESN'T WORK AS GOOD AS THE
OLD RECIPE, BUT WORKS GOOD ENOUGH TO COVER YOURSELF IN THE SMOKE WITH ENOUGH
TIME TO DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR.

- POWDERED SUGAR                 <- EASILY OBTAINED AT THE LOCAL GROCER'S
- SODIUM NITRATE (SALT PETER)    <- CAN BE OBTAINED AT THE DRUG STORE
- SULFER  (OPTIONAL)             <- IF POSSIBLE, BUT NOT NECESSARY
- CHARCOAL OR FINE POWDERED CARBON (OPTIONAL)  <-CRUSHED CHARCOAL WILL DO
- A FIRE CRACKER WICK OR OTHER TYPES OF HEATING DEVICE


--------------
HOW TO MAKE IT
IT IS QUITE SIMPLE TO MAKE THE SMOKE SCREEN IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE THE OPTIONAL
INGREDIENTS.  JUST MIX THE SUGAR WITH THE SALT PETER, IN THE RATIO OF 3 PARTS
SUGAR, 2 PARTS SALT PETER.  YOU HAVE TO MIX IT GOOD SO THAT THE SALT PETER IS
DISTRIBUTED WELL WITH THE SUGAR.  THEN YOU CAN STORE IT IN SOME MEDICINE
BOTTLE OR A BEER CAN.  IF YOU LIGHT THE CONTENTS IN THE MEDICINE BOTTLE IN A
ROOM, IT WILL FILL A ROOM OF ABOUT 12 FEET BY 12 FEET ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN
ESCAPE ANY SITUATION.  IF YOU PUT IT IN A BEER CAN, (NOTE: THE BEER CAN DOES
NOT HAVE TO BE DRIED OUT FOR THIS TO WORK.) IT CAN FILL A STREET WITH SMOKE
AND LAST FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES, WHICH IS PLENTY OF TIME TO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF
ANY SITUATION.  WELL I THINK ENOUGH IS SAID ABOUT THE EASY SMOKES.
**OPTIONAL**
IF THE EASY WAY CREATES ALL THAT SMOKE, THEN WHY IS THERE AN OPTIONAL ONE,
RIGHT?  WELL I INCLUDED THE OPTIONAL ONE SINCE THE OPTIONAL ONE CAN DAMAGE
THE ENTRAPPED VICTIM IN THE SMOKE PRETTY BAD.  I MEAN BAD ENOUGH SO THAT THE
VICTIM CAN PASS OUT AND DIE, IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A HOUSE OR
SOMETHING.  I'D ADVISE YOU TO STICK WITH THE EASY ONE, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE
OUT THERE IS CURIOUS ENOUGH TO BE A KILLER SO I WILL INCLUDE THE OPTIONAL
VERSION.
YOU MUST FIRST CRUSH THE CHARCOAL.  YOU NEED A LUMP OF CHARCOAL PER OUNCE OF
SUGAR USED.  I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE THE 3 OUNCE OF SUGAR VERSION OF THE
SMOKE SCREEN.  YOU CAN ALTER THE MEASUREMENTS FOR LARGER QUANTITIES.
THE CHARCOAL IS BETTER THAN POWDERED CARBON, ESP. IF THE CHARCOAL IS MATCH-
LIGHT.  (NOTE: IF YOU HAVE PLAIN CHARCOAL, YOU SHOULD USE LIGHTER FLUID WITH
THE CHARCOAL.)  MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARCOAL IS VERY FINE.  NEXT MAKE YOUR
3:2 MIXTURE OF THE SUGAR AND THE SODIUM NITRATE.  3 OZ. OF SUGAR TO 2 OZ. OF
SODIUM NITRATE.  THEN, MIX THE 3 LUMPS OF CRUSHED CHARCOAL INTO THE 3:2 MIX-
TURE, AND MIX VERY WELL.  MIX THE POWDERS UNTIL THE MIXTURE IS A DARK GREY
NEAR GREY, MIXTURE.  THEN GET AN OUNCE OF SULFER AND MIX THE CONTENTS CARE-
FULLY.  DON'T SPILL THE SULFER OR THE MIXTURE ON THE FLOOR OR CARPETING SINCE
IT CAN DAMAGE IT.  WHEN YOU MIX IT WELL ENOUGH, YOU HAVE FINISHED!!!  IF YOU
DO LIGHT THIS SCREEN, BEWARE...YOU ARE RISKING YOUR OWN LIFE.  GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF THERE BUT TRY NOT TO BE SEEN.  TIME THE WICK IF POSSIBLE.  IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A ROOM WITH YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY IN IT, IT CAN KILL THE
DUDE WITH 5 MINUTES OF THIS SHIT.  THE THING IS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET HIS
ASS OUT OF THERE, TOO.  SO JUST KNOCK HIM OUT COLD BEFORE YOU IGNITE THE
SMOKES.  IF HE DOES AWAKE, AFTER THE SMOKE DISSIPATES, HE WILL MOST LIKELY
DIE OF SOME LUNG PROBLEMS.  ANYWAYS, IF YOU WANT HIM TO DIE QUICK WHO GIVES A
DAMN.  BUT, MAKE SURE IF YOU DO THIS DON'T GET YOUR ASS BUSTED.

--------------
WAYS OF ESCAPE
--------------
I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON THIS ISSUE BUT HERE IS ONE WAY OF EVASION.  FIRST
MOST LIKELY WHEN A PERSON GETS IN SOME HEAT NOWADAYS, IT'S GONNA BE ON THE
STREETS.  SO...LOOK FOR A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN HIDE OUT FOR A WHILE.
LIGHT ONE NEARBY AND WHEN THE SMOKE GOES UP, LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOUR OPPONENT
UNTIL HE IS VERY DIM AND FAINT, THEN MAKE YOUR MOVE.  GO TO YOUR HIDING
PLACE. AND STAY THERE FOR A WHILE.  WHEN YOU THINK THE COAST IS CLEAR, JAM
WHEREVER YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ASS SAFE.


WELL...I HAVE SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THIS TOPIC.  WELL...HAVE FUN!!!

DATED: 01-16-1985

PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY CURIOUS MINDS.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS
PHILE WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE.  BUT THE BEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE SECRETS TO
YOUR SELF.
