These fun-filled things work best if you happen to have alot of deralict
friends, as I do... your first day of school you should bring the
following items, to insure a prosperous school year:
 
   1) fountain pen (and extra ink refills)
   2) 3 tubes of super glue (krazy glue)
   3) pennies (about $1.00 worth)
   4) baloons (small sized for convieniance)
   5) mirror (small hand held)
   6) liquid soap
   7) lighter, (matches as alternate)
   8) firecrackers (ladyfingers are great)
   9) screwdrivers and other tools (small)
  10) small squeezable bottles (like nasal de-congestant type)  
  11) wire (10-20 ft)
  12) tape recorder mic. (battery operated pref.)
  13) ziplock baggies
  14) half of an orange
  15) ligth bulb (75 watts and over are great)
 
     This will do for now... some of the cool things to do are,
take the pennies and glue them to the cafeteria tables, (and watch
the custodians try to get 'em off). This also looks good with
silver dollars glued to the fire alarm (so it goes off when the
custodian attempts to remove the coin) and to a door some place
(principals preferably).
 
     Another thing to do with a coin is, heat it up over a bunson
burner (in chem) and just as the bell rings, toss the coin into the
hall, i will guarantee you will know when the coin is picked up...
while your using the bunson burner, fill your little squeeze bottle
with gas, then cap it tight and put it in your pocket... later,
take a firecracker, and glue it to the bottle, use a cigarette as
a fuse extension, then put it in the bathroom, and get to class
fast... (gas and glue make a nice flame)...
 
     While your in the bathroom, place a light bulb over the door,
and when the superintendant goes to see what the explosion was, he
gets a nice little surprise...
 
     Now for the wire, if you can access a room near your locker,
when no one is in the room, take off the speaker cover on the pa
system, and hook 2 wires from it, to your mic. (then into your
locker) this is good for getting your friends out of classes...
just ask for them... (use your tools for that one, and try to be
neat about it)...
 
 
     Now for your mirror, you can use this for getting your,
uh..."friends" locker combanation.... after you get that, take that
little baggie you got, and put the orange in it... let it sit for
a week or four, then open the baggie, and place it in your friends
locker... I can guarentee he/she will love it!
 
     Another thing that is fun to do, is, take a penny, and glue
it over the key hole on your friends gym locker, just after he goes
out, thus he has to truck around all day in his gym stuff, (unless
you rent him your screw driver to pry the penny off)
 
     Ballons are fun to play with in chem lab, fill them with the
gas that you get out of the taps on the lab desks, then tie up the
baloon tight, and drop it out the window to the burn outs below,
you know, the ones that are always smoking, they love to pop
baloons with light cigaretts, get the picture? good...
 
 
     Those fountain pens are cool, because if you make a slight
jerking motion with your hand, ink squirts all over the room, (or
person, what everyour aiming at) it is a good idea not to let the
teachers know you have one of those, it makes it too easy to find
out who did it when theres ink all over the principals face... (or
on the floors, walls, and ceilings...)
 
     Liquid soap is great for use in crowded hallways, it turns
everybody into a ice skating star, (works especially well when
people come in from the rain)... if your school is anything like
the one I goto, people never flush the toiletts, a little liquid
soap in here makes for a nice surprise, I mean, what happens when
the soap is not flushed out of the toilet, and the suds aren't
flushed out either? the janitors have a really good time trying to
figure out that one... (glue a quarter in one of the urinals,
always a winner)... turn off the water under the sinks too...
getting back to the soap, it is also good on the hand railings in
hallways and on steps, if you mix perfume with it, some poor grub
has to have that stench on him all day.
 
        I shall go into more depth at a later date, so look for a
new volume coming to a bbs near you... this was: how to have fun
at school part 1, (by: walkon) part 2 will be written as soon as
i have some more time.
