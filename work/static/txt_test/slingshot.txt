             Fun Shit To Do With A Wrist-rocket (sling-shot)

well, scince these things have a bunch of power u can take out those damn birds that wake u up at 6 in the morning when u are trying to sleep

u can shoot out windows from a reasonable distance if u have good aim..if not go in closer but run fast

you can shoot shotgun primers taped to marbles into crowed areas 

that damn dog that awaly barks at me when im walking by really piss me off next time rover barks at me im shooting him in the ass!

if u shoot paint balls u can really create som art on buildings or glass

light an m-60 and shoot it into someones open garage

shoot the heads of .22 bullets at shit they work real good

dont u hate those guys that always yell at you when they go by in their cars if you shoot their window out they wont yell ne more (they might wanna kick your ass though!!)
