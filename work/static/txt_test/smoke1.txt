So, you want a smoke screen? Well, in this article I will discuss how to
make Black, White, and Grey, as well as colores Smoke.
 
  Here is a somewhat explosive composition uses by the Germans in WWII for 
black
 smoke:
 
Hexachloroethane - 60%
Anthracene       - 20%
Magnesium(powder)- 20%
 
   Brown Smoke:
 
Pitch            - 29.2%
Pottasium Nitrate- 47.4%
Borax            - 10.6%
Calcium Carbonate-  4.9%
Sand             -  4.0%
Sulpher          -  3.9%
 
Note: You may substite pitch by soaking liquid tar in sawdust. This has better
effect.
 
Grey Smoke:
 
A:
Hexachloroethane - 50%
Zinc Powder      - 25%
Zinc Oxide       - 10%
Pottasium Nitrate- 10%
Colophony Resin  -  5%
 
B:
Hexachloroethane - 45.5%
Zinc Oxide       - 45.5%
Calcium Silicide -  9.0%
 
Note: Because of the high vapor presure of HC, HC smokes must be sealed in
and artight container. Also the Zinc Powder one may react with water so
be carefull.
 
White Smok:
 
Potassium Chlorate- 20%
Ammonium Chloride - 50%
Naphthalene       - 20%
Charcoal          - 10%
 
Pottasium Nitrate - 48.5%
Sulpher           - 48.5%
Realgar           -  3.0%
 
Pottasium Nitrate - 50%
Sugar             - 50%
 
Yellow Smoke:

Solunle Glutinous Rice Starch -  6%
Potassium Perchlorate         - 56%
Sulpher                       - 11%
Anthracene                    - 33%
