                        How to make Smoke Bombs

Ingredients-  Saltpeter (Potassium Nitrate)
              Sugar
              Alcohol (100% is best, but plain rubbing alcohol will work)
              Gunpowder (or some ground-up rocket engines)
              Matches (Get a box of 50 packs -they can be very useful.)
              Coffee can
              Cigarette

Instructions:
------------
Combine the sugar and saltpeter in a 3:1 ratio (Sugar:saltpetre) and heat
over a low flame until the mixture has thoroughly melted together. (It will
look like sticky white lumps when ready)  You need to stir this continually
while heating, and remove it from the flame at the very first sign of smoke.
It is safer to work with smaller batches.

Now, dump all of this "smoke powder" into a coffee can, add some match
heads, moisten it with a little alcohol, and add gunpowder until all 
the smoke powder is coated.  Now tape a cigarette between the match 
heads in an unopened book. Imbed the book into the mixture.

Light the butt, and walk casually away to find a nice alibi within 5 minutes.

Notes:
You should be able to find some Saltpeter in a local drug store.

All of the gunpowder, match heads, and alcohol is simply to insure good
ignition.  You can omit them, but if you have them, mix them in for
reliability's sake.  For the fuse, you can either use the one listed, 
or either some cannon fuse, or a rocket igniter and an electrical system.
