                          SMOKE BOMB (3 VERSIONS)

INGREDIENTS (Version 1):

     Salt peter (available at almost any drug store)
     Sugar (granulated works best)

METHOD:

     Mix 4 parts salt peter with 1 part sugar
     Shake Well
     Heat at a VERY low heat until the mixture resembles caramel
     Note: You do not have to heat the mixture, but it is hard to work
     with in a powder form
     Shape the mixture and insert a fuse (a match will do it too)
     Note: It helps to add a few match heads to the caramel mixture to
     even out the burning

WARNING: This burns VERY hot. Do not set it off near highly flammable
areas. Concrete is the safest place to burn them (and it still leaves a
lasting impression on the surface).

INGREDIENTS (Version 2):

     4 parts sugar
     6 parts potassium nitrate (Salt Peter)

METHOD:

     Heat this mixture over a LOW flame until it melts, stirring well.
     Pour it intoa future container and, before it solidifies, imbed a
     few matches to use as fuses.  One pound of this stuff will fill up
     a whole block with thick, white smoke!

INGREDIENTS & METHOD (Version 3):

     Simple somke/stink bomb - you can purchase sulphur at a drugstore under
the name: flowers of sulphur.  Now when sulphur burns it will give off a very strong odour
and plenty of smoke.  Now all you need is a fuse from a firecracker, a tin can, and the sulphur.
Fill the can with sulphur (pack very lightly), put aluminum foil over the top of the can, poke a small hole into the foil, insert the wick,
and light it and get out of the room if you value your lungs.  You can find many uses for this!
