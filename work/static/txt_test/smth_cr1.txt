      Welcome to the first issue of

             SMOOTH CRIMINAL!

We made this mag because we wanted to give
you some of the news and advices you would
never have heard of else...

S.C  will  contain  good hints for you who
think  your  money is never enough, or you
who   like   making  life  hard  for  your
enemies...

              Greets/Editors

PS  the  hints we got from a small Swedish
mag.  The hints given are carefully tested
and works 100%
?
Free  postage:  cut out and use the stamps
on  the  post services' adverts that comes
to your mailbox.

Free  postage  2:   write  a  non-existent
address on the envelope and write the real
addressee as sender.  No stamps of course!

Free  car-wash:  buy a normal car wash but
take the plastic plate back home and buy a
piece  of  plastic of equal thickness in a
hardware  store.  Drill a pattern similiar
to  the  original  car-wash  plate  in the
piece of plastic.  Make several copies and
use them when washing your car next time.
?
Free  calls  in phonebooths:  Push the SOS
button  and  put  a  tape-recorder  to the
reciever  and  play  your  number  (a good
dialer is in some issue of DatorMagazin).

Free    subscription:    order   a   gift-
subscription  to  yourself and write it on
somebody you don't know at all!  Look up a
name and address in the phonebook.

Free  electricity:   Put  one  or two very
strong   magnets   on   your   electricity
counter.   It  will  stop completely or at
least go slower.
?
Gain  some  money:   Put  an  advert  in a
paper:  "Profitable job on the side:  earn
about  100,000 crowns/year without effort!
Send 30 Kr+stamped envelope with your name
and  address."  The  ones who answer get a
short letter saying "Do as I!"

Rent  a  car  cheaply:  Rent a Volvo, pull
the  plug  in  the luggage boot, up to the
left under the cloth carpet.
?
Buy  something cheaply:  Walk into a store
and  pretend  to  come  from another shop:
"Hi I am Mr.  Smith from Smith's TV store.
I'd like to order a Video, model..." -"You
can   send  it  C.O.D  because  I  haven't
ordered  anything  from  you  before.   My
address  is..." This is possible with most
items.

Free  car-park:   Insert  a  flattened out
straw  (type  McDonalds) and put the clock
forward to as much time as you need.
?
           - Practical Jokes -

With  Calcium  carbide, which is available
in  most  paint  stores,  you can get many
interesting   effects!   In  contact  with
water   it   generates   very  strong  and
unpleasant smell together with thick smoke
and  a  highly  explosive  gas  -  can  be
ignited with a lighted cigarrette!

The  tip:   Flush  half  a kilo c.c in the
toilet  at somebody you don't like.  Put a
lighted cigarrette on the toilet seat, and
evacuate swiftly...

Do  this  when  your enemy enters, effect:
cutting   wounds   from  flying  porcelain
shards,  broken  ribs from flying into the
wall+24 hours deafness!
?
*  Stick  a  lot  of  holes  in  a tube of
toothpaste.  very funny in the morning.

*  Put  a small piece of soap in a tube of
toothpaste.  Even funnier effect!

*  Put  a piece of tape on the phone hook.
(nothing   happens   when   you  lift  the
reciever).

*  Order  alarm  call  for somebody...  At
04:00 in the morning!

*  Put plastic foil on the toilet seat, on
the porcelain rim.  Disgusting effect!

* Put a percussion-cap between the rim and
the toilet-seat.  Frightening effect!

             Misc. Swindles:

Fool 10Kr machines.  Copy a real 10Kr note
in a common copier.  Put tape (wide, brown
"carton-tape"  on  the  backside.   Cut  a
rectangular  hole around the serial number
(the lower one) and a bigger hole over the
crown  (in front of the King's nose).  You
can  also  put  tape  over  these  places.
------------------------------------------
Hint  for  snuffers:   Fill your empty box
with  soil,  go to the kiosk and buy a box
of  snuff.   When the kiosk-owner hands it
to  you,  you change your mind and want to
buy  another  brand.  When she goes to get
it,  you  change  the first box to the one
with soil in!
?
How  to  fix  the  colour-clip on clothes:
Drill a hole exactly 12 mm from the centre
of  the  existent hole.  Make the hole 5-6
mm  big.   Use  a  nail  or  other pointed
device      and     move     the     stop.
------------------------------------------
Lottery  machines:  Insert a coin and pull
the  lever very slowly, while feeling with
your fingers in the hole where the tickets
come out.  When you can pull a ticket, you
can  go  on pulling as many as you want...
------------------------------------------
Music:   Buy  a pre-recorded cassette, but
open  it  in  the hinges.  Don't break the
seal.   Then  go  and exchange the tape in
the store.
?
100Kr Machines:  Insert the 100Kr note and
stick    it    to    the    bottom    with
double-adhesive  tape.   Put a transparent
piece of plastic atop the 100Kr note.  The
machine  will  take  the piece of plastic.
You  can go on inserting pieces of plastic
as      many      times      you     want.
------------------------------------------
10Kr  machines  (which sucks in the note):
It  works just as good with the cover of a
weekly  magazine  that has been cut to the
correct size!
?
Get secret phone numbers:  call the health
insurance  office and say you are from SCB
and  say  you  want  the  phonenumber to a
certain  person  because  you're  doing  a
really important interview and it won't be
complete    without    a   phone   number.
------------------------------------------
Free:   Call  90130,  hastening of a call,
and  order  a  hastening.  Make up a phone
number  and  say  you  want  to hasten it.
Then  you  say  your number is the one you
really want to reach.  The operator enters
the  line to check "your" phone number but
enters  the  one  you  wanted  to  hasten.
Those  talking  on the phone will not want
to continue.

?
               Explosives:

Nitro-glycerine  equivalent  explodes like
real  nitro but with smaller effect.  It's
made   of  1/3  Iodine  crystals  and  2/3
ammonia.    This   should   be   dried  to
crystals.   This will be very sensitive to
blows.
------------------------------------------
Other mixture, not sensitive:
65% (weight%) calium permanganate
35% (weight%) red phosphor
Burns faster than dynamite! Approx. 950m/s
Advice:   Don't  mix  more than 100 g at a
time!
