?       HUNGRY IN THE SUPERMARKET !
       ---------------------------

GO  IN  A  BIG  SUPERMARKET  WHEN  YOU ARE
HUNGRY, AND DON'T FEEL ANXIOUS TO TAKE ALL
THOSE  SWEETLY  GOODS  LYING AROUND.  OPEN
SOME  CHOCOLATE-PACKS  AND  COKE  BOTTLES,
JUST AS YOU WOULD FEEL AT HOME.  DRINK AND
EAT DURING YOU WALK AROUND, AND IF YOU ARE
LUCKY ENOUGH NOBODY WILL SAY ANYTHING, BUT
IF      THE     STUPID     ARSEHOLE     OF
SUPERMARKET-DETECTIVE  COMES AND WANTS YOU
TO  PAY ALL YOU ATE, YOU WILL HAVE ONLY TO
PAY  WHAT  YOU  ARE  JUST IN POSSESSION OF
(E.G  THE COKE-BOTTLE!), AND ALL THE OTHER
PACKS  YOU  OPENED  BEFORE, YOU NEEDN'T TO
PAY FOR THEM!

            ------------------

SOME   GUYS   REALLY  LIKE  TO  EAT  FRESH
OYSTERS,  AS  OTHERS  LIKE  TO EAT PIZZAS!
WELL, ENTER A FISH-SHOP, WHERE OYSTERS ARE
SOLD,  AND  GO  ON  EATING SOME OF THEM IN
FRONT  OF  ALL  OTHER PEOPLE (IMAGINE THEM
WATCHING  YOU!).   IF SOMEONE WANTS YOU TO
PAY, REFUSE!, COZ THERE EXISTS A LAW, THAT
OYSTERS  CAN  BE EATEN IN THE SHOP WITHOUT
PAYING,  JUST  TO  TRY  IF THEY ARE FRESH!
BUT  MOST  OF  THE  PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS
FACT AT ALL, MAYBE EVEN THE SHOP-OWNER!!!

BORDEAUX  AND  COTE  DU RHONE WINES, NEVER
HESITATE  TO  ASK  FOR  SOME WINE YOU JUST

SUPERMARKET,    BOTH   TAKE   A   SHOPPING
CARRIAGE,   AND   WALK  AROUND  AS  NORMAL
CUSTOMERS, BY CHOOSING THE GOODS YOU WANT,
AND  YOUR  FRIEND  TAKES  EXACTLY THE SAME

YOU AT THE SAME TIME HOW YOU BOTH TAKE THE
SAME  ARTICLES,  DO  IT  INDIPENDENT  EACH
OTHER!).   THAN  YOU  GO TO THE CASH-DESK,

FINALLY DON'T WANT TO BUY!)).  INSTEAD YOU
GO  AGAIN  TO  THAT GIRLY AT THE CASHDESK,

CARRIAGE)  AND  TELL  HER  (BY SHOWING HER
YOUR BILL, OF COZ), THAT YOU FORGOT TO BUY
SOME  SHAVING-BLADES  (OR SOME OTHER CHEAP
CRAP!)  AND  YOU  CAME  IN AGAIN WITH YOUR
SHOPPING-CARRIAGE,  COZ YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
LEAVE IT ALONE OUTSIDE !  REMEMBER TO SHOW
HER THE BILL, SO SHE CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING,

            -----------------

LOTS   OF   TRAINS  IN  BRITAIN  ARE  "PAY
TRAINS",  YOU  BUY  YOUR  TICKET  OFF  THE
CONDUCTOR ON THE TRAIN.  THE THING IS THAT
MANY TRAINS ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND YOU DON'T
GET ASKED ABOUT A TICKET UNTIL YOU GET OFF
AT  YOUR  DESTINATION.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
FOR  A  CHEAP TRAIN FARE IS TO SAY YOU GOT
ON THE TRAIN AT A STATION MUCH NEARER YOUR
DESTINATION    THAN    YOU   REALLY   DID.
SOMETIMES  THEY  GET  A  LITTLE SUSPICIOUS
THOUGH AND ASK YOU WHAT THE FARE SHOULD BE
FROM  "YOUR" STATION.  TO GET AROUND THIS,
SIMPLY  DIAL  TRAIN ENQUIRIES AND FIND OUT
BEFORE YOU GET ON THE TRAIN!
