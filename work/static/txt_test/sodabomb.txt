                         Soda Bombs 
	(Typed up by the Dread Pirate Roberts) 
	 
Supplies Needed: Granulated Pool Chlorine 
		 (At least 75% calcium hypochlorite) 
		 Sugar 
		 Water 
	         2 Liter Soda Bottle   
 
DIRECTIONS:   
	Take a quarter cup of chlorine and place it in an empty and  
dry 2 liter bottle.  Put the same amount of sugar and place it in 
the bottle too.  Add enough water to make the mixture soupy.  
Put the cap on and throw it away!!!  (It splatters all kinds of  
blinding and noxious chemicals when it goes off)  As the sugar and 
chlorine dissolve in the water they will react with each other.   
The bomb is about as loud as an M-80.  The bomb will take anywhere 
from 30 seconds to 5 minutes to go off so if it doesn't explode 
still stay away and come back the next day to examine it.  If it doesn't 
work try adjusting the amounts of sugar and chlorine. 
 
NOTE:  I've never personally made one of these soda bombs, so just 
	be careful when you decide to make them.  I'd be interested 
	in knowing the results and what mixture you used.
