Sparkler Bomb

Materials:

   * 12-20 sparklers
   * duct tape

Procedure:

   * Bunch sparlers together so that all ends are even, except one sticking
     out of the middle of the pack about 2".
   * Cover the whole thing with a lot of duct tape, leaving the middle
     sparkler bare as a fuse.
   * After lighting the end sparkler, it burns to the others, all igniting
     at the same time, causing a decent explosion.

It really works better than it sounds. Maybe you already know about it, but
we'd just thought we'd check.
