Items needed:
===== =======
1.  Some Sparklers (green work best)
2.  Duct Tape or Black Plastic Electrician's Tape (latter is better)
3.  Lighter, Matches (How the fuck do you think you're gonna light it)

Procedure:
==========
1.  Group some sparklers together.  Extend one out to act as a fuse:

         ------------=====================
         ------------=====================
             ------------=====================
         ------------=====================

2.  Wrap the assembly TIGHT with the tape.  Leave some of the "fuse" 
    exposed.  The tighter you wrap it, the louder the blast.


3.  Light the fuse and run like hell.  After a small delay, ignition
    will result in a bright flash, loud report, and large amounts 
    of fucking HOT, flaming sparklers to be scattered in all directions.



       HAVE FUN!  (And don't blow off you're fucking fingers)
