				  "Stinkum!"

	Ever wanted to clear out a hallway, stink up a classroom(just hope
your not in it), maybe even take revenge on the principal for all those 
detentions...well here's your chance.
	Stinkum is the classic stink bomb but nastier. Here's how to make it:
Get some iron sulfide, sold for about $.35 for only 1/8th of an ounce. Even 
better and easier than that is ammonium sulfide; it stinks to high heaven 
like rotten eggs and no one can stand to be around it once it has been 
"accidentally" spilled on the floor or "accidentally" vaporized by an explo-
sion. 
	To make some, you mix 4 ozs. of sulfer with 8 ozs. of hydrated lime
in a stew pot. Hydrated lime can be bought from a building supply store for
about $.10 a pound. A quart of water is added and the mess is heated and
stirred until the sulfer has completely blended. The hydrated lime will sink
to the bottom of the pan and the yellow liquid is then poured off into a 
bucket.
	Take the bucket outside, unless of course u enjoy the smell, and add
one pound of sulfate of ammonia(bought at a garden store for $1.65). Stir it
for a minute and hold your nose. Then cover the bucket with plastic wrap and
let it set for a half hour. Then pour off the liquid slowly through a cloth
filter into a bottle. The liquid is vile but not poison. 
	It can be poured on the floor, shot from a water gun, thrown in a
bottle or lightbulb, or vaporized by a firecracker.
