

IN THIS TEXTFILE WE WILL DEAL WITH
THE FINE ART OF STEALING WAREZ OFF
A SOFTWARE STORE...


MOST OF THE TECHNIQUES WORK BEST IN
LARGE SOFTWARE STORES,WHERE THEY
CAN'T WATCH YOU ALL THE TIME...

I->TAKE IT BACK

1) THIS IS THE EASIEST OF ALL AND
PROPABLY EVERYONE HAS DONE IT:

  A)BUY THE WARE AT FULL PRICE

  B)GO HOME AND COPY IT

  C)RETURN IT FOR A REFUND

  SIMPLE?OF COURSE,BUT NOT THAT
            EFFIECIENT!



II->FILL'R UP

2)THIS IS SIMILIAR TO THE FIRST ONE
BUT ALOT BETTER.

    MOST STORES LET YOU TAKE THE WARE
    OUT OF THE BOX AND LET YOU TRY IT
    OUT! WELL HERE'S WHAT YOU DO:

    A)TAKE A BUNCH OF WAREZ OFF THE
    SHELF,AND GET ALL THE BOXES(OR
    WHATEVER THEY COME IN) IN A PILE,

    THEN START TRYING THEM ALL OUT...

    B)AFTER YOU ARE DONE MAKE SURE ALL
    THE DISKS ARE OUT OF THE BOXES,NOW
    SHUV A FEW OF YOUR FAVORITES INTO
    THE CHEAPEST WARE'S BOX THAT YOU
    CAN(NO MORE THAN 3 OR FOUR DISKS)

    C)NOW PUT ALL THE OTHER EMPTY BOXES
    AWAY...NOW GO PURCHASE THE CHEAP
    WARE WITH ALL THE OTHER DISKS IN IT
    MAKE SHUR IT IS SOME CHEAP ONE LIKE
    'CAVERN CREATURES' FOR $5.95 OR
    SOMETHING LIKE THAT.(MAKE SHUR YOU
    DIDN'T PUT TO MANY DISKS IN THE BOX
    THE CLERK MIND BE A BIT SUSPISCIOUS
    IF ONE BOX WAYS 7LBS!

    D)NOW TAKE IT ALL HOME,TAKE OUT
    YOUR NEW WAREZ...THEN RETURN THE
    CHEAP WARE FOR A REFUND.


III->REPAIRED DISK DRIVE

3)THIS IS THE EASIEST...


    YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR DISK DRIVE
    FOR THIS ONE...

    A)CARRY YOUR DISK DRIVE IN AND ACT
    LIKE YOU JUST PICKED IT UP AFTER
    BEING REPAIRED.

    B)UNFORTUNATELY(FOR THE STORE)YOU
    HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR RIDE!SO WHY
    NOT GO TRY OUT SOME OF THE NEW

    GAMES...NOW FIND AN AWESOME GAME,
    QUICKLY SLIP IT INTO YOUR RECENTLY
    REPAIRED DISK DRIVE.

    C)HMM?IS THAT YOUR RIDE YOU HEAR
    OUTSIDE? TIME TO GO...
    NOW JUST LEAVE...

    D)NOW GO HOME AND ENJOY YOUR NEW
    WARE.


 NOTE:THIS IS PROPABLY THE EASIEST.


IV->MAKE SOME MONEY

4)WANT SOME EXTRA MONEY?

    A)GO TO SOME SMALL SOFTWARE STORE
    AND BUY SOME CHEAP WARE.

    B)NOW TAKE OFF THE PRICE TAG.

    C)NOW GO TO SOME BIG COMPUTER STORE
    WHERE EVERYTHING THEY SELL IS
    USUALLY $20-$30 MORE...

    D)NOW TELL THE SALESMAN YOUR MOM
    BOUGHT THIS WARE AS A PRESENT AND
    HAS SCRATCH OFF THE PRICE TAG AND
    LOST THE RECIEPT...THE ONLY PROB-
    LEM IS ITS FOR THE WRONG COMPUTER.

    E)THEN REQUEST A REFUND...THIS MAY
    TAKE A WHILE TO TALK HIM INTO IT,
    BUT YOU USUALLY END UP WITH YOUR
    MONEY...
