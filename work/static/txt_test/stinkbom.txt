*Sulfer            *
*Hydrated Lime     *
*Sulfate of ammonia*

                           Procedure
                          ***********

1) In the first pan mix 4 ounces of sulfer with 8 ounces of hydrated
lime.

2) Add a quart of water to the first bucket.

3) Heat and stir the liquid until the sulfer has completely blended.(The
hydrated lime will sink to the bottom of the pan and a yellow liquid is
poured off the into the bucket.)

4) TAKE THE BUCKET OUTSIDE and add 1 pound of sulfate of ammonia.

5) Stir it for a minute or until it begins to smell.

6) Cover the bucket with some plastic wrap and let it sit for about a
half an hour.

7) Pour out the liquid into a bottle so the bottle is half full.

8) Fill the second pan three quarters of the way up with water.

9) Add 1/2 a pound of chili powder to the water and mix until all of the
powder has disolved.

10) Fill the rest of the bottle with the mixture in the second pan.

Note:
Sulfer can be obtained in a chemistry set. Sulfate of ammonia
(a fertilizer) can be purchased at the garden section of a home
improvement/hardware store. Hydrated lime can be obtained in the
building supply department where cement is sold. And chili powder can be
bought at any grocery store.

                           To Use
                          ********

Pour your fart formula in to your squirt gun. Be careful because if you
get on your hand you will smell for a long time! Now pretend you are the
terminater on blow everthing away!
Or you could leave it in the bottle and put it some where (ie. Your
neighbors back yard) and put a salute in it and run!
