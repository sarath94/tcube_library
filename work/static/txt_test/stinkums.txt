IRON SULFIDE IS SOLD FOR $.35 FOR ONLY 188TH OF AN OUNCE. EASIER TO MAKE AND
JUST AS POTENT AND COSTING ABOUT $.50 A QUART IS AMMONIUM SULFIDE. IT STINKS
TO HIGH HEAVEN LIKE ROTTEN EGGS AND NO ONE CAN STAND TO STAY AROUND IT ONCE IT
HAS BEEN SPILLED ON THE FLOOR OR VAPORIZED BY AN EXPLOSION.
 
TO MAKE SOME, YOU MIX 4 OUNCES OF SULFER WITH 8 OUNCES OF HYDRATED LIME
IN A STEW POT. A QUART OF WATER IS ADDED AND THE MESS IS HEATED AND
STIRRED UNTIL THE SULFER HAS COMPLETELY BLENDED. THE HYDRATED LIME WILL SINK
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AND THE YELLOW LIQUID IS THEN POURED OFF INTO A BUCKET
 
TAKE THE BUCKET OUTSIDE, IF YOU HAVE ANY SENSE, AND ADD 1 POUND OF SULFATE
OF AMMONIA. STIR IT A MINUTE AND HOLD YOUR NOSE. THEN COVER THE BUCKET WITH
PLASTIC WRAP AND LET IT SET FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. THEN POUR OFF THE LIQUID
SLOWLY THROUGH A CLOTH FILTER INTO A BOTTLE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN OUTSIDE
YOU CAN USE YOUR BATHROOM, JUST HOPE NO ONE HAS TO GO FOR AN HOUR OR SO. THE
LIQUID IS VILE BUT NOT POISON.
 
A 5 POUND BAG OF SULFATE OF AMMONIA FOR $1.65 CAN BE BOUGHT AT ANY GARDEN STORE
AND GARDEN SULFER IS VERY HIGH GRADE AND MAKES EXCELLENT GUN POWDER. IT HAS
10% INERT INGREDIENTS SO 10% MORE SHOULD BE ADDED TO ANY FORMULA REQUIR-
ING SULFER. I BOUGHT THE HYDRATED LIME FROM A BUILDING SUPPLY STORE FOR $.10
A POUND.
 
STINKUM IS EITHER POURED ON THE FLOOR, SHOT FROM A WATER PISTOL, THROWN IN A
BOTTLE OR LIGHT BULB OR VAPORIZED BY A FIRECRACKER. THE SAME GOES FOR THE
FORMALDEHYDE OR ACROLEIN. TO VAPORIZE THE ABOVE NASTIES, A LITTLE BOMB IS
USED. THE BEST BOMB CASING IS A PLASTIC COIN HOLDER WITH A SCREW CAP. THESE CAN
BE BOUGHT FROM ANY COIN SHOP FOR $.10 EACH. THE THIN BRASS TUBING IS BOUGHT
AT A HOBBY SHOP. THE WAX IS BOUGHT AT A GROCERY IN THE CANNING SECTION. TO KEEP
THE FIRECRACKER FROM GETTING WET, DIP IT AND PART OF THE TUBING INTO MELTED
WAX. ENOUGH CHEMICAL IS POURED INTO THE COIN HOLDER TO MAKE IT FULL WHEN THE FI
RECRACKER IS PUT IN AND THE LID IS SCREWED ON. IT IS FILLED AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE BEFORE USING.
 
IT IS IGNITED WITH A CHEMICAL IGNITER, SHOWN FURTHER ON, OR WITH A MATCH OR
CIGARETTE. THE SAME SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN A GLASS BOTTLE BUT THAT MIGHT INJURE
SOMEONE.

  ALSO, AN EASY WAY IS TO SIMPLY GET BUTERIC ACID FROM ANY CHEMICAL SUPPLY
STORE. LEAVE A SMALL UNCAPPED BOTTLE  BEHIND A DOOR, WHEN A PERSON ENTERS 
THE DOOR WILL PUSH OVER THE BOTTLE  AND SPILL THE ACID...DO NOT GET ON
YOUR CLOTHING AS IT IS HARD TO UN-STINK...A COUPLE OUNCES CAN GO A
LONG WAY...
  A HOMEMADE STINK BOMB CAN BE MADE BY MIXING A BATCH OF EGG WHITES, DRANO
(SODIUM HYDROXIDE) AND WATER.  LET THE MIXTURE SIT FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE
USING.
