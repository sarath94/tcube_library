THE PROSPECTS FOR SNEAKING INTO MOVIES IN THE EAST BAY
Reviewed by FTANG-LOUIE

  When I was a much poorer lad, I would pay for Matinees and sneak into other
movies at the same house for the rest of the day. (Watching several movies
in a row bends your sense of reality seriously. In one day I saw five movies,
all with a common feature: The male and female meet, barely getting along,
run through various action scenarios, and end up in bed halfway through
the film. I left the theater looking for women in trouble.)
  Here's my prognosis on your chances for getting sneaking around free:

	UA Berkeley - 99%	California Berkeley - 90%
	ACT 1 & 2 - 70%		Shattuck Cinemas - 20% (they suck)
	Piedmont 3 - 45%	Albany 1 & 2 - 10%
	Oaks 1 & 2 - 80%	Grand Lake - 80%
	Northside - 75% (100% with people hacking)

  Some tips for effective sneaking:
	Buy a ticket for the second or third show that you plan to visit,
	  preferably the most popular one.
	Dress down. Carry a jacket into the 1st & 2nd show, then wear it
	   between shows after that.
	Wait until the ushers enter to clean the theater before leaving. That
	   many fewer ushers in the lobby.
	Plan your day carefully. Try to take advantage of crowds and lines
	   that will showup during multiple show openings.
	Buy something at the snack bar. Even if they suspect you, they will
	   care less if you're buying concessions.
	Most theaters have a work shift change at 6:00. If you feel
	   you've become too visible, stay in a theater until 6:10 or so.
