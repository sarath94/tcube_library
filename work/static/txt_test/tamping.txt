Tamping
-------

        Tamping is nothing more than an operation performed before the
explosion, to regulate and direct the destructive power of the explosion. In
other words, if a pound of black powder is ignited with a match, the explosion
will occur but most of the destructive force will take the path of the least
resistance - into the atmosphere. Now, if the same pound of black powder was
placed within a steel pipe, and sealed at both ends, except for a tiny hole
for the fuse, the explosion could be regulated with ease. This tamping
operation is necessary for any forms of demolitions in order that the
operation be successful. A stick of dynamite placed on a concrete roadway
untamped, when exploded will create a very small crater, perhaps a few inches.
If this same stick of dynamite were tamped, by placing several sandbags on
top of if and around it, the explosion would create a much greater crater.
This tamping operation is absolutely necessary for the demolition of a large
structure or building.
[1> When attempting to sever a steel rod or pole, through the use of
explosives, place a charge on each side, leaving a small gap between the butts
of the explosives.
[2> When cutting a chain, place the explosive charge on one side and tape it
securely into place.
[3> When cutting any odd-shaped object, the best explosive to use is plastique
because of its flexibility. It is especially usefull and effective when
cutting heavy metal cables. The compound should be placed around the side of
the cable that is to be cut, about a half-inch thick.
        When sabotaging railroad tracks with explosive, use plastique if
available, since this is the easiest substance to use when trying to sever
objects or irregular shapes. The most common way of cutting train tracks is by
placing a charge of high explosives on either side of the "I" beam track, so
as to have the forces of the two explosions act upon each other, thus causing
the middle object maximum destruction.
        Another method which has proven equally effective is placing a charge 
between the rail and the switch. The switch is one of the weakest points along
the line, and a relatively small charge will not only sever the switch and
rail, but will also rip up the ties and the railroad bed. Tamping with 
sandbags can and should be used if at all possible, since the extent of the
damage is multiplied several times by the addition of the sandbags. Tamping
can be useless if you are on a silent lightning-fast mission. In this case,
a two-pound charge of TNT carefully placed between the switch and rail will
almost certainly do the trick without tamping. The best procedure when 
engaged in this type of sabotage is to repeat the acts every three-quarters
of a mile or so, so as to delay the repairmen and create confusion.
