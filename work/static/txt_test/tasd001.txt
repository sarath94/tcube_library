 PAINTBALLING
 FIRE BOMBS MADE REALLY EASY
 HOTEL SCAMS
 THE ART OF BIG STORE SCAMMING

==================================

 Disclaimer - Fuck the disclaimer, this is a free country.. or is it? We have
the 1st ammendment protecting our right to free speech, right? Anyhow, this
file should explain a few ways of making sure that every American can realize
what he or she could do if the need ever arised that you needed to cause chaos,
but not like any of us would do THAT, now would we?

==================================

PAINTBALL - Here is a fun, new object of pain and fun on the scene, paintball
 guns. Easily availible with the new popularity of paintball fields across the
 country. While not especially cheap (ok, maybe this isn't a TOTALLY cheap
 thrill file) they are usually worth the money of seeing some poor, innocent
 lamer screaming in pain after being hit by 10 semi-frozen .68 caliber
 paintballs traveling many hundreds of feet per second into the side of their
 head, bare skinned leg, arm, ect. These suckers welp, bruise, bleed, scar. I
 have a pretty good mark on my left calf after a friend of mine shot me from
 2 feet away thinking the gun was empty.

   Anyhow, you can purchase, steal, card, whatever a paintgun fairly easily
 and start having fun. Get a semi-automatic paintgun if you can, it is worth
 it. Next get a CO2 container, at least a 20 oz., then get a case of 2500
 paintballs. Ok, now you have your over priced pneumatic paint spewers,
 required oily substance paintballs, and plenty o' presurized liquid CO2,
 decide who you don't like. This part shouldn't be too hard. Now, after
 you find out where mr x. lives, what kind of car he drives, and what his
 favorite Saturday morning cartoon is go to his house and shoot the living
 fuck out of the house, car, dog, sister, mr. x, dad ect. Paintballs may be
 washable out of clothes, but they DON'T come out of stained wood houses,
 and they do a damned good job of denting cars, smahing out plastic lights,
 you get the idea. The type of paint gun I would recommend would be the
 Auto-Mag, or an F-2 Illustrator, easy to clean if a ball breaks, and they
 can fire balls REALLY quick.

   One night when I was out paintballing, we were going down the street, and
 popping cars off at a new car lot, always funny to come back the next day and
 see the lot owner's shit their pants. Oh, by the way, did I mention that
 it is a much better idea to do this type of stuff at night, and in a vehicle,
 preferably 4 wheel drive. Also remember one time when we hit a pizza dude
 in the head with a paintball, he dropped his pizzas and started chasing us,
 but this is when we decided to 4 wheel drive our way up to the great
 wilderness.

  Anyhow point is, there are a lot of things that you can do with a paintball
 gun, and you can find many fun items that need to be a different color, or
 in a different shape. Have a blast....


EASY EASY EASY FIREBOMBS - Ok, this one we came across after reading the back
 of a bag of chlorine shock treatment. Says that you are not to mix this
 stuff with pretty much anything, but mainly emphasized the petroleum products
 category. So what do we do? We mix Chlorine with some brake fluid and normal
 unleaded gas. We mixed about 2-3 spoonfuls of Chlorine shock treatment (75%
 availible chlorine) with about the same amount of brake fluid/gas mixture in
 a coffee can with a lid sealed. So we waited a little bit, nothing was
 happening. One of my friends decided he wanted to go and take a look inside
 the can, it was right after he said that when it went BOOM!. So we
 experimented a little more. We found out the more chlorine you put in, the
 faster it blows. We found this out the hard way when we drove up to a pay
 phone and decided to blow it up. The driver was filling a 1 liter pop
 bottle when I noticed it was about 25% full of Cl, at this point I was
 wondering if that was real smart. So he added the brake fluid, thinking he
 had a good minute and half, put the lid on the bottle, and reached to put it
 outside on the payphone and <BOOSH!>. A giant boom, and a fireball came back
 inside the car, along with a lot of chlorine and burned brake fluid. We all
 thought he had blown his hand off, but remarkably he didn't have a single
 burn, although he had a lot of chlorine chunks on him, and his car. Everyone
 in the car about threw up after inhaling all the wonder gases, so I don't
 recommend breathing the resulting smoke. Point is, don't put too much chlorine
 in, it will go. Find out how much you need for different timings. Once again,
 have a blast.

FUN AT HOTELS - This is a fun little scam to pull on hotels. Go into a hotel
 and sit in the lobby where you can hear people checking in. Listen for some
 of the people's names, and sorta follow them to their rooms. Obviously don't
 make it look like you are intentionally following them. And watch what room
 number they go in. Leave, come back later when different people are at the
 front desk, and go to one of the convieniently placed courtesy phones in most
 hotels for inter-hotel communication, and ring up the rooms of the people
 you followed, until you get a room with no answer. Decide if you want to
 get into this room or another one on your list. Who you hit is up to you,
 just don't do more than one room per front desk shift, they get kinda
 suspicious after a while. Anyhow, after you picked your room where the
 people are not there, go to the desk and say you need the key, because
 someone else (probably the person who payed for the room) is your dad, brother
 etc. has the key and you forgot to get it from them before they left. They will
 more than likely ask for the name of the person paying for the room, and the
 room number. Then if your lucky, they will give you the extra key and smile
 real goofy like. Once you are in their room, have a blast. Take what you want,
 hit the alcohol bar by the bed, or take their shit laying around that looks
 valuable. Easy as that. Scams are fun.

THE ART OF RIPPING OFF BIG STORES - Ok, lets think for a minute ( I know, this
 will be hard for some of you ). What type of place has a lot of expenisive,
 technical shit, that no one that works there knows about? Right, large multi
 item stores that also have computer sections. Sure, they have their computer
 GW-Basic wizard Anthony working, but I don't think he will be much of a
 problem. Most of the computer "sales staff" at stores like Service Merchandise,
 Montgomery Wards ect, had their only computer training working the cash
 registers at McDonalds. Next question is, How can I take advantage of this
 fact?

   Ok, here is one really good way. I have done this personally many times,
 and have not been caught yet. Buy the item that you want at one of these type
 of stores, make it something that you can replace with something else that
 looks similar to your just bought item, like internal modems, hard drives,
 video cards. Anyhow, you buy these, take them home and replace them with
 something else that looks fairly close to the item you just bought, like
 many 2400 bps modems look very similar 14.4k internals, 3.5x1 inch hard drives
 all look very close when the stickers have been blow dried (heated) off one
 40 meg drive and slapped on another 230 meg drive. Ok, so now you have the
 cheaper item in the box, and the more expensive item in your computer, or
 for sale, ect. Next take the item back for a refund, and watch the sales
 people fumble with the modem/hard drive/ect, acting like they have a clue and
 handing back your money. Sound easy? It is. Go have fun. Oh, by the way, hayse
 external modems are also game, because the shells of all their modems look
 identical. The 14.4k Ultra, and 1200 smartmodem look the exact same, just
 switch faceplates, and there is virtually NO way to get nailed.
