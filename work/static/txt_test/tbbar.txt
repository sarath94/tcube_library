          I came a across this idea while looking around 
  a Rockaway Sales hardware store for a suitable pipe for a pipe 
  bomb. I came across this plastic tubing. It was bendable, yet
  was not too thin. I decided to see what I could do with it.
          I decided that this would be suitable for a bomb that
  could get into "hard to reach places" and bend around corners
  for tight fighting spaces. I got about 6 inches of it. I yanked
  a fuse out of a pipe bomb because I didn't feel like making them, 
  but virtually any fuse would be fine. I melted some wax from
  the bottom of a candle onto the "mouth" of the tube. This formed 
  a half circle.

          Then I placed the fuse on top of the half circle and 
  melted a little more wax onto it to seal it. I left about 1 1/2 
  inches of fuse in the tube. Then I sealed of the rest of the opening.
  Then I poured some blackpowder into the other end. Until it was about
  halfway full. Then I stuffed tissue paper into it until it was pretty 
  tight. Then I could have either used more wax or sealed a cap onto it.
  You could have also sealed a cap onto the fuse section, but I was too
  lazy. Now this cannot bend at 90 degree andgles but it is still
  good for a fair curve. Just remember to pack it tightly and to have 
  sturdy endcaps. Have fun!
