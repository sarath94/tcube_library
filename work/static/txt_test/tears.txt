    I have thought of two easy ways to make tear gas. The first one works, but I
have yet to try the second.

**************
MATERIALS    *
Chili Powder *
Vinegar      *
Squirt gun   *
**************

    PROCEDURE

1. Mix the powder and vinegar untill it has a consistancy like water. The color
should be kinda brown.
2. Place the mixture in an airtight container untill use.
3. At the time of use get a squirt gun that doesn't leak (if it DOES leak, wear
rubber gloves) and fill the gun with the tear gas.

*****BE CAREFULL!!! IF THIS SHIT GETS IN YOUR EYES OR IN A CUT IT WILL HURT*****

    I thought of this next way after my friend accidentally got sprayed in the
eye with hot sauce at TACO BELL.

**************
MATERIALS    *
Hot Sauce    *
Viegar       *
Chili Powder *
(the powder  *
is optional) *
**************


   The procedure is like the first but instead of useing the chili powder you
use the hot sauce. OR, for a more powerfull mixture, USE BOTH!!!

 Once again BE CAREFULL WITH THIS SHIT!!!!!

    I AM NOT RESONSIBLE IF SOME IDIOT USES THIS SHIT AND BLINDS SOMEONE!! EVEN
 I DON'T KNOW HOW POWERFULL THIS SHIT IS!! THIS FILE IS HERE SO YOU CAN HAVE FUN
 READING IT, NOT SO YOU CAN GO BLIND SOMEONE!!
