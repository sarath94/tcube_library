Tennis Ball Bomb

Ingredients:

   * Tennis (or racquet) ball
   * Strike Anywhere match heads
   * Gunpowder (if you're really adventurous)
   * Duct tape

Instructions:

   * Cut a SMALL hole in the tennis ball.
   * Cut off a bunch of match heads and fill the tennis ball with them
   * Duct tape the tennis ball so that the match heads won't fall out, and
     so the ball is secure.
   * Throw it at something. When it hits, the match heads will ignite and
     all burn.

Modifications:

   * If you fill it 1/2 with gunpowder first, then add the match heads, it
     will cause a massive explosion when it ignites! Be warned, if it is
     shaken suddenly, the matches can ignite in your hand, thus exploding
     the gunpowder early. I once dropped a box of strike anywhere matches
     on a table and the all ignited within seconds. If gunpowder had been
     in the box, it would not have been a pretty sight.
