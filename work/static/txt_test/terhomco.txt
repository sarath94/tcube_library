\_____________________________________________________________________________/

Napalm
------
        Mix gasoline with dish washing detergent (Ivory Soap) untill the
        solution is like honey. Use it in a bottle with a rag as molotov
        cocktail or paint it on something and light it. It will burn alot
        longer than regular gas.

Land Mine #1
------------
        Take a soup can and line the inside with Petroleum jelly (enough so
        you won't have air between the cup and can. Place a  Styrofoam cup
        inside the can and f)lU it with gasoline. Cover the soup can with a
        sheet of Aluminum foil and tape it down so it is air tight. Place can
        in a freezer over night. Dig a small hole in the ground and place the
        can in it foil side up. Cover it up with with dirt about one inch
        thick. Carefully place a nail in the dirt (don't break the foil!).
        When someone steps on the nail and pierces the foil, the mine will
        go off and so will their foot.

Land Mine #2
------------
        Get a push button switch. Take the wires and connect one end to a
        9 volt battery connecter and the other to a Solar Igniter. Connect
        the other wire of the battery to the other wire on the solar igniter.
        Connect the solar igniter to the fuse of one of your favorite bombs
        (M-80, pipe bomb, etc.). Dig a hole, not too deep, but enough to
        cover up the whole thing. Plant the switch under a leaf or something
        and plant the bomb about 5 feet away. When the person steps on the
        switch, there should be a 3 second delay, then it will blow.

Black Powder
------------
        Place 5 pints of alcohol in a bucket. In another bucket, put 3 cups
        of granulated potassium nitrate, 2 cups powdered wood charcoal, and
        1/2 cup of powdered sulfur into the bucket. Add 1 cup of water and
        stir well with a wooden stick. Place the bucket on a heat source and
        add 2 more cups of water and wait for it to bubble but don't let it
        boil. Remove the bucket from the heat and pour it into the alcohol
        while stirring well. Let the alcohol stand for about 5 minutes. Strain
        the liquid through cheesecloth to remove the powder. Wrap the cloth
        around the powder and squeeze out the excess liquid. Place a piece
        of screen on top of a bucket. Place a workable amount of black powder
        (That black muddy looking stuff) on the screen and begin to workd it
        through. Spread the end result on a piece of newspaper and let it dry
        in the sunlight. Now you have black powder which can be used to make
        other bombs.

Impact Bomb
-----------
        Mix solid Nitric Iodine with househould ammonia. Wait overnight
        and pour off the liquid. You will be left with a muddy substance.
        Let it dry untill it hardens up. To use it, put it in a bottle or
        can and just drop it or throw it at something.

Carbide Bomb
------------
        This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution....
        Obtain some calcium carbide. This stuff can be found at nearly any
        hardware store. Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel)
        and put it in a glass jar with some water. Cover the jar tightly. The
        carbide will react with the water to produce acetylene carbonate which
        is similar to the gas used in cutting torches. Eventually the glass
        with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a burning rag
        nearby, you will get a nice fireball.

Exhaust Bomb
------------
        Install a spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tail
        pipe by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
        Attach a wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the
        switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached
        to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply
        hit the switch and watch the flames.

Turn Signal
-----------
        Detach the plastic running light (or turn signal) cover on someones
        car.  Break the bulb.  Test the bulb with a voltage meter to make sure
        it is not live. Pack the bulb with Flash Paper and replace the cover.
        When the person starts his car or goes to turn, a quick burst of flame
        will pop out of the back of his car making him think it is on fire.


Winger
------
        This is the ultimate in assault devices. It is a large, three person
        sling-shot designed for hurling water baloons up to 100 yards. They
        are supposed to leave the sling-shot at 240mph but through personal
        experience, I've gotten some to go at least 150-200 yards. As for the
        speed, I don't know. These are good for launching almost anything
        that is not motion sensitive. You can get them at some boat shops
        (that's where I got mine), or you can order them from:

                Winger Sports LTD.
                2167 Buhl Avenue
                North St. Paul Minnesota  55109

Intro:

        It's time for another file to be written. People tell me "From your
        files, you don't look very much like an Anarchist, I mean, you use
        fair grammar and all..". I would just like to say that I am an
        Anarchist, not an illiterate (sounds pretty fake coming from some one
        in New Orleans).. Also, as you can see, I'm running out of ideas. If
        anyone has any good ideas or even thoughts about making bombs, tell
        me. I can take a thought and turn it into a Cat Bomb for instance..
        On to the Bombs!


Shocking Experience
-------- ----------

        Run a wire from spark plug #1 on your car (preferably 6 or 8 cylinder
        engine) out to the bumper. Fix a rubber platform to the bumper (if you
        have a metal one) and attach a coat hanger to the wire and prop it up
        like a ram-rod. Next, pull up behind some fool outside of a shopping
        mall waiting to pick someone up. Touch the coat hanger to the car and
        rev up your engine a little. The next person to touch a metal part of
        the car will get a 12 volt current through their whole body! Not enough
        to kill (unless the guy has a pace maker), but enough to make them jump
        and scare the shit out of 'em!


Cat Bomb
--- ----

        Take a full can of tuna. Open it, remove all of the tuna and clean it
        out real good. Drill a small hole in the side and then nail the can
        down to a piece of plywood. Take a Champagne Party Popper and remove
        the little explosive device on the string. Run this through the hole
        (so the explosive in on the inside and the string on the outside) and
        fill the can up with about 1/8 inch of gunpowder (Heavily salt-petered
        for easy ignition). Place the lid back on and pack it down good. Use
        Clay or Silicon to seal up the cracks on the sides. Put some of the
        tuna back on top and place the bomb in the path of some soon to be
        suprised feline! Tie a string to the igniter string and hide about
        20-30 feet away. When the cat stops to have a bite, pull the string!
        And if all works well, the device should explode and scare or kill
        the little furry bastard.


Loud Pipe Bomb
---- ---- ----

        Mix Potassium Perchlorate with some 600 mesh Aluminum Powder in a
        2/1 ratio. Drill a small hole in a small piece of 1/4 in. copper
        tubing. Place a fuse in the hole, pack the tube with the above
        mixture, and close both ends of the tube. If you don't know what
        to do from here, you shouldn't be reading this!


Bird Buster
---- ------

        This isn't really a bomb, but it's fun anyway! Place some Alka-Seltzer
        in someones bird feeder. When the bird eats it, it starts producing
        gas. The bird can't release the gas and if he ate enough, he should
        explode!


Tennis Ball
------ ----

        Take a box of kitchen matches and saw all of the heads off (must be
        white tips! The kind you can light on the ground!). Get a tennis ball
        and pop a little hole in the top. Put the match heads in the tennis
        ball untill it is full (this takes a while). Throw it at hard as you
        can at your target. If the match heads were packed tight enough, it
        should produce a nice sized explosion.


Time Delay
---- -----

        These are the simplest forms of time delays for bombs that use fuses.
        (1) Light a cigarette and break off the filter. Place the end of the
        fuse in the end where the filter used to be. In about 10-15 minutes,
        your device should go off. (2) Set up your bomb on a wooden platform
        (When planting bombs, I always do so I don't have to waste time
        setting up). Place a drop of glue on the wood and mount a party candle
        on it. Lay the fuse of the bomb across the candle where it cannot move
        and the flame cannot miss it. These "always" work and I have never had
        any problem with either one.

Drink Fun
----- ---

        If you want to have some fun and scare on of your friends, take a 9
        volt battery and drop it in his or her drink. When they go to take
        a sip, they'll get a small shock and probably spill their drink all
        over themselves.

Locker Fun
------ ---

        If you would like to get revenge on someone in school, wait till before
        a real long holiday (or a weekend if you can't wait). Take an apple and
        grate it on the locker vents. If the person doesn't find out, in about
        a day or so, his or her lcoker should be surrounded by fruit flies and
        all of their belongings should stink pretty bad!

Dept. Store Fun
---------------

        Most department stores have those little clamp on deals that they stick
        on clothes to keep people from stealing them. Do what you must do to
        get one of these (a friend who is employed there, hold the place up,
        whatever). Find some lady with 3-5 kids, a stroller, a huge purse and
        lots of other stuff that would make her look suspicious. Stumble by and
        plant this little devices in one of her pockets and wait by the exit.
        when she walks out.. Bells! Cops! the works.. And to top it all off,
        one embarrased lady! Another way is to take the thing home and rip the
        little metal thing out of it (looks like a piece of card board with
        metal wrapped around it). Place it deep in your wallet or in your pants
        and wait around by the entrance. When you see the same type of person
        going out, you go in! Same effects. Only problem is, you have to get
        back out! I suggest just leaving the little prize on someone in the
        store and leaving (don't hang around, or do it at the same store twice,
        the Cops may get suspicious of you).

Street Fun
----------

        Take some fishing line and run it across the street. Next, hang rocks,
        bolts, sinkers, etc. at windshield level. Find a telephone pole or a
        tree to run it across on. Another thing to do is to use light string
        to tie 2 garbage cans together and run the string across the street.
        If you can't figure out what that does, you shouldn't be reading this
        file!

Bolt Bomb
---------

        Take a bolt, 2 washers, and 2 nuts. Screw on the first bolt, place a
        washer after it. Put gun powder on the washer, put the next washer on,
        and screw on the last nut so that the nut is hanging out past the end
        of the bolt and the 2 washers are pushed together. Drop the bolt on the
        bottom nut and it will explode. Nothing big, but it is re-usable. Kinda
        like the space shuttle. Uh, scratch that last part.

Spoke Gun
---------

        Take a bicycle spoke and that little nut that holds it onto the rim.
        Screw the spoke into the the nut a little bit. Powderize a match head
        and push it into the nut. Pack a wad of paper into the nut with another
        spoke. Hold the device from the end that doesn't have the screw on it
        and then hold a flame under the nut. When it gets hot enough, it will
        blow up and send the paper flying. This is small scale. If you wanted
        to, you could use a piece of threaded rod and a 1 1/2 inch long nut to
        make the results a little more interesting. You can even add your own
        projectiles. Just be sure that the paper is in tight enough to compact
        the powder.

Flour & Gas
-----------

        Take a new bag of ordinary household flour and pour gas on it. Light
        it and drop it off of something high onto a hard surface. No explosion,
        but it gives a nice efect. Kinda like an Atomic Bomb.

PineSol & Cl
------------

        Wrap some cholrine up in a paper towel and tie it up tight. Next, tape
        it high on the inside of a Mayonaise jar (See illus. 'A'). Fill the
        bottom of the jar up (don't touch the paper!) with PineSol. Screw the
        top back on and place it on the ground. When ready, knock the jar over
        and run like a bat out of hell (haul the mail, cruise, mobeelin', bust
        ass, do what you have to do, just get away!). It will explode, and
        release alot of chlorine gas. Don't breathe it in! It will kill you!

( illustration A )
                     /========\ <- Lid
                     |       *| <- Chlorine
                     |       *| <-
                     |        |
                     |'.'.'.'.| <- PineSol
                     |.'.'.'.'| <-
                     \________/ <-


Hefty Gas
---------

        Fill a hefty bag with gas from a gas stove. Tape a fuse to it and light         it. Have a book of matches at the end of the fuse to insure ignition.
        Woof! No more hefty bag! Or if you want to add some fun to it, forget
        the fuse and just shoot bottle rockets at it. Same effect.

Door Shock
----------

        For this, you will need a 12 volt transformer. Strip about 1 inch off
        of the end of each wire. Run the wires out of your bedroom door. Place
        some electrical tape on the bottom of the outside door knob and then
        tape the bare wires down so they won't touch. Disguise the wires so
        they won't look suspicious. Turn on the transformer and wait for a
        victim. This is the ultimate in privacy protection devices. Don't
        use more than 12 volts. You can kill somebody.

Doorstop Bomb
-------------

        Take a .22 caliber bullet and remove the lead. Pack a wad of paper
        in the open cavity and make sure that the gunpowder is still firmly
        packed in place. Now, take a BB and tape it to the firing cap.  Go
        to the door stop (the spring kind with the rubber tip work great!)
        and remove the rubber cap and slip the shell into the hole in the
        center of the spring. Pack it in there tightly, wrap tape around the
        shell if it does not fit snuggly}~PNext, replace the rubber cap if you
        can. You want the end with the BB taped to it sticking out of the
        stopper. When someone opens the door into the stopper, bam! You can
        leave the lead in the shell if you wanna risk killing the victim or
        an innocent bystander.


Flashbulb Fun
-------------

        If you take a flashcube and pull out the little bulbs in it, you will
        discover that when you smash the little power suckers, they go off!
        They are real hot too! Just about hot enough to be an igniter.
        Try taping one to a doorstop with a fuse of your favorite pyrotechnic
        taped to it. Try taping one to the inside of a gas pump "Holster",
        if you wish. Just make sure that the bulb will get a good smack and
        it will go off. Don't try it in your hands or anything like that
        because the magnesium in the bulb will burn the living hell out of
        you.


House Bomb
----------

        O.K. so this one is really sick. Go into the home of your victim
        and tape or superglue a couple of kitchen matches to the bottom
        of the door so that the tips will drag on the ground. Now tape or
        glue some light grit sanding paper or emery cloth to the floor in
        the path of the oncoming matches. That was easy, now you go around the
        house and put out the pilot lights and crank up the gas. Get em all
        out first or you may be part of the bomb. Now, get out of the house
        before you sufficate! Stop!! DON'T USE THE SAME DOOR TO LEAVE!!!!
        O.K. you can sit back and wait for the bar-b-que family to get home
        and watch the fireworks or you can move away to the nearest friendly
        neighboring country. If you do decide to stay, don't stand too close,
        or you may end up a tater tot.


Wimp Startler
-------------

        Simple, cheap, safe. Blow up a clear balloon inside of a light fixture
        so that it touches the lightbulb. If possible, have it on top of the
        bulb because heat rises and will pop the balloon sooner (before the
        geek says, "Gee, its kinda not as bright as it used to be." When the
        light goes on, the balloon goes off. Nothing great but you won't go
        to jail for it.


Light Igniter
------------

        If you smash even a burned out light bulb and twist the ends of the
        element together, it makes a beauty of a starter for any fire needed
        explosion device. Just tape on the old fuse and leave.


Starter Startler
---------------

        You can take a wire and run it from the coil in your pals car to the
        steering wheel (if it's metal) or to the ignition key slot. When quizmo
        goes to start his car- buzzzzzzzzzzzzzap! Nothing like smoking fingers!
        This one has interesting side effects on pace maker patients.


Party Balloom
-------------

        Before your next party where smoking and drinking will occur (I do so
        hate cigarette smoke), fill up a few balloms with natural gas from the
        stove or bar-b-que. When you pals (or enemies) get loaded and start
        popping the ballons, like they always will. Some dork will decide to
        pop a few with his stogey. If all goes well, one of them might give him
        a little surprise.


Auto Annihilator
----------------

        You owners of pick up trucks are already in possesion of urban assault
        vehicles. All you need is some nice size rollable objects, some cord,
        and some duct tape. Tape over the latch that hold the tailgate shut.
        Tie a cord from the inside of the cab to the tailgate to hold it
        closed. Now, put a bowling ball, shopping cart, tire, large diameter
        steel pipe, etc. in the bed of the truck. It must be large enough to
        roll over the gap between the tailgate and the bed. So now your
        cruising along the interstate at 65mph and some prick pisses you off.
        Just pull ahead of him, floor it, and release the tailgate cord.
        Now look in the rearview mirror. Where is the asshole? Oh, that's him
        spinning out of control with a grocery cart stuck in his grill. Or
        is that him over there in the ditch along side of the road. No!
        wait! that's him speeding up to catch you! No problem. You were smart
        enough to have a few more goodies tied to another cord, like a bowling
        ball. Let her rip! Wham! Yeah, that's him with the broken steering
        rods smashing into the divider. I knew he was back there somewhere.
        Try it going up a steep hill or a bridge to take out more happy
        motorists.


Flare Fun
---------

        Take the glass off of a light bulb and fill it with the yellow
        make from grinding up the inside of a road flare. Tape the glass
        back on and screw it back into the socket. Give a new meaning to
        the "Red Light" district.


Non-Handymans Bomb
------------------

        Go to the nearest auto parts store and pick up a pack of road flares
        and an aerosol can of starter fluid. Take the flare and duct tape it
        to the can so that the first inch or so of the flare will burn with
        out touching the side of the can. When you wanna blow it up, use the
        handy little scratch-n-start piece of the flare and let it blow.
        Not too difficult, eh?


Fun With Cyano
--------------

        You call it superglue, we call it fun. Any Cyanoacrilate glue will
        do the job. It is the best prankster material ever produced by a
        manufacturer. Here are a few ideas to get you started. Glue the door
        to the school shut. Glue car doors, car locks, and car trunks. Glue
        money to the floor at the mall. On a busy day at the mall, put some on
        a coin and roll it infront of some lozers. It won't dry until it hits
        their skin because it needs moisture to dry. Spill some on your enemies
        pants. Glue the dictionary shut. Glue books to the table at t8e#
          library. Glue windsheild wipers down. Glue gaps caps on. The
        possibilities are endless. Cyano takes a while to dry on metal
        surfaces. When you put a few drops of cyano in baking soda or on saw
        dust, it turns to a rock hard substance. Fill the desired spot with
        the powder, and apply as much glue as necessary.

        With World War III knocking on our door, I feel it is every persons
right to be able to protect and defend his or her's investments. With the
Government making it almost impossible for the average person to have a decent
weapon, I guess that only means that you will have to make them yourself. So,
I've come back with a few more ideas, both serious and prank.

Fire Grenade Launcher
---------------------

        First, you will need a 12 or 16 gauge shotgun. You must mount two
      T=ygs to it and make it like a tripod with the stock being the third
        leg. Take a shell and hacksaw off the front part with the shot in
        it. Place the modified shell in the chamber. Take a long piece of
        circular wood (like a broomstick) and shove it in through the barell.
        Make sure it is at least touching the shell (don't push too hard
        unless you want a broomstick through your head!). Next, mount a
        small rubber platform on the end of the stick. Securely fasten a
        molotov cocktail the the platform (coke bottle filled with gas,
        oil, detergent, and an oily rag in the top). Light the rag and pull
        the trigger. With practice, you can shoot this thing wih amazing
        accuracy.


Explosive Ideas
---------------

        Everyone has made a bomb and just lit it and watched it go boom.
        there are ways to get more out of your boom. If you take something
        like sandbags or bags of cement and lay them on top or on the sides
        of your bomb, the result will be much more damaging and will create
        a smoke screen (if you use something like cement or flour and not
        rocks or sand).


Itching Powder
--------------

        I know this is no Anarchy, but ideas are running low. This, however,
        makes a great practical joke! Get some fiberglass insulation (either
        by punching a hole in your wall and removing it, or by going to a
        construction sight and lifting it). Grind it up good (for large
        amounts, I suggest something like a blender). Now just place this
        pink powder anywhere you wish. This is better than the stuff you can
        buy in the store. I got some asshole in the movies and he itched
        all throughout the show. Don't ask me why I had itching powder in
        the movies, but it did work.


Rain Detination
---------------

        Here's an easy way to let mother nature help you set off a few bombs
        (they must be ELECTRICAL). If it's raining out, place 2 test leads
        into a cup (or 2 wires), each on opposite sides, so that they are
        touching the bottom of the cup. Next place some metalic substance
        (that DOES conduct electricity) in the bottom (not too much! Don't
        connect the wires!). Wire up your favorite bomb around this leaving
        the only break in the circuit in the bottom of the cup. When it rains
        enough, the water will begin to fill cup, mix with the metal, and act
        as a bridge for the electricity. If all was set up correctly, your
        device should go off. In the event of no rain, just use one of those
        Solar Cells (obtainable from Radio Shack) and connect it to a solar
        igniter (this must be a FIRE type bomb with a fuse!). Connect the
        igniter to the fuse, set the bomb in a shady place (that is soon
        to be in the light), and leave. All should go as planned.


Whistler Bomb
-------------

        Do you have one of those asshole coaches in your school always
        blowing that damn whistle at you? If so, here's an idea that will
        shut his ass up for a while. First, make a small batch of your
        favorite friction sensitive explosive (see early "Terrorist Home
        Companion" files written by me and a few other aRu members). Fill
        his whistle up with it (not a whole bunch or he'll notice. Just enough
        so it will make a boom he will never forget. Now, go be an asshole on
        the field and wait for his to give it a good blow. "Gee coach, how did
        you get shrapnel in your face?"


Exploding Pipe
--------------

        So you have that asshole teacher or mean old man on the block who
        smokes a (cough, cough) pipe. Or maybe even your favorite weedhead.
        Steal the guys pipe (like from his car). If it is a good pipe, you
        should be able to pull it into 2 pieces. Clean it out (with a pipe
        cleaner, they're cheap). Run a fuse from the bowl back to where the
        pipe goes back together. Place a small explosive inside the tube
        where the smoke comes through to the mouth and wire it up to the
        fuse. Next, replace the burnt tobacco that was in the bowl and put
        it back where you got it from. "What's wrong, not getting enough
        drag? Maybe you should suck harder. Boom!"
