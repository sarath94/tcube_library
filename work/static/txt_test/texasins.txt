NITRIC ACID
.LJ
     Nitric acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incendiary mixtures, and acid delay timers. It may be prepared by distilling a mixture of potassium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.
.cj
MATERIALS
.lj
     Potassium nitrate (2 parts by volume).
     CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid (1 part by volume.)
     Two bottles or ceramic jugs (narrow necks are preferable.)
     Pot or frying pan.
     Heat source (wood, coal, or charcoal.)
     Tape (paper, electrical, masking, etc., but not cellophane.)
     Paper or rags.
 
Sources: Drug Store. Motor vehicle batteries, Industrial plants.
     IMPORTANT: If sulfuric acid is obtained from a motor vehicle battery, concentrate it by boiling it until white fumes appear. DO NOT INHALE FUMES.
     NOTE: The amount of nitric acid produced is the same as the amount of potassium nitrate. Thus, for 2 tablespoonsful of nitric acid, use 2 tablespoonsful of potassium nitrate and 1 tablespoonful of concentrated sulfuric acid.
 
PROCEDURE:
 1. Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug. Add sulfuric acid. Do not fill bottle more than 1/4 full. Mix until paste is formed.
 
CAUTION: Sulfuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing. If any is spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water. Fumes are also dangerous and should not be inhaled.
 
 2. Wrap paper or rages around necks of the 2 bottles. Securely tape necks of bottles together. Be sure bottles are flush against each other and that there are no air spaces.

Bottle B should be slightly lower than bottle A, but not so low as to let the
paste to flow from A to B.
 
 3. Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is SLIGHTLY lower that bottle containing past so that nitric acid that is formed in receiving bottle will not run into other bottle.
 
 4. Build fire in pot or frying pan.
 
 5. Gently heat bottle containing mixture by moving fire in and out. As red fume begin to appear periodically pour cool water over empty receiving bottle. Nitric acid will begin to form in the receiving bottle.
 
CAUTION: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter. As an added precaution, place bottle to be heated in a heat resistant container filled with sand or gravel. Heat this outer container to produce nitric acid.

 6. Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed. If the nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it into cleaned bottle and repeat Steps 2-6.
 
 
CAUTION: Nitric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing. If any is spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water. Fumes are also dangerous and should not be inhaled.
 
Nitric acid should be kept away from all combustibles and should be kept in a SEALED CERAMIC OR GLASS container. 03-31
Cellulose Nitrate is known as smokeless powder. It doesn't take much time or
effort to make it and can be useful for use indoors where you don't want any
smoke left floating around the room.
 
Materials
---------
Concentrated Sulfuric Acid
Concentrated Nitric Acid
Absorbent Cotton
Sodium Bicarbonate
A 250ml Beaker
Ice Bath
Paper Towels
Tongs
 
Procedure
---------
Put the beaker in the ice bath. Add 70ml of Sulfuric Acid, and 30ml of
Nitric Acid.
Divide the cotton into 7/10 gram pieces. Use the tongs to submerge each
piece of the cotton into the acid solution for 1 minute.
Rinse each piece of cotton in 3 successive baths of water, each bath
containing 500ml of water. Use fresh water for each piece.
Now, immerse the cotton into 250ml of Sodium Bicarbonate. If it bubbles
rinse it in fresh water once more and contiue the procedure until no bubbling
occurs.
Squeeze each piece dry and put it on paper towels overnight.
 
You already know what you are supposed to do with it now. Have fun...
