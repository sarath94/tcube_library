 
INSTRUCIONS FOR TIMERS AND PRIMERS FOR EXPLOSIVES.


     TIMERS:

     Timers for explosives are much more readily availible now
     than several years ago. The watch companies have seen to this
     To make a simple timing device all you need is any digital watch
     with alarm and some wire. Digital watches with alarms are the
     perfect timer for a bomb. They can be modified very easily. To do
     this, simply open the watch and disconect the buzzer. Solder some
     wires to the buzzer leads and you are all set. This devise must
     be conected to a primer.

     PRIMERS:

     Primers are a small explosive devise to set off a larger
     explosion. An example would be an atomic bomb used to detonate a
     hydrogen bomb. The primers I will be discussing are for much
     smaller devises though. You will need these parts: the above
     timer, a 6-12volt battery, a low volt coil relay, and a solar
     egniter. Take the timer and solder the buzzer leads to the coil
     of the relay. The relay coil must be below 1.5v,.02amps. These
     are availible at any Radio Shack store. Wire the battery in a
     curcuit with the relay and solar egniter. The solar egniter
     should be the type used in model rockets. Set the timer alarm to
     go off whenever desired. the solar egniter can the be inserted in
     many types of explosives such as plastique, dynamite, m-80's or
     the like. The solar egniter provides enough of an explosion to
     set these substances off. Since you never want to be around when
     an explosion goes off, this is a very easy way not to be there.

      Note: This devise is never intended for actual use! This
      information is merely for your personal knowledge.
