File 01:Dripping Tap Timer
==========================
        This type of timer is made for a sink/faucet of some sort, where you can control
the rate of water dripping out of the nozzle.  The most convenient way of doing this
is to place the whole thing in the sink, but the charge (bomb) can be placed else
where, depending on how much wire you have.  What you're gonna have to do is get a glass
jar (or any other non-conducting container), size doesn't matter (depending on how much
time you need).  Hook two wires to aluminum foil (Steel wool may also be used)
, placing the strips of aluminum over the mouth of the jar.  Connect one wire directly
to the detonator.  Connect the second wire directly to the battery.  Run a third wire
from the battery directly to the detonator.  Now place the glass jar under the dri
pping tap (if not already placed), and turn faucet on (adjust the rate according to how
much time you need).  When the water level in the jar reaches the aluminum foil
contacts, the electrical circuit is closed, thus detonating the bomb.
 
File 02:Relay Timer
===================
        This type of timer is best used when long delays are required.  You will need
two batteries (A & B respectively).  Hook battery A to a relay.  Battery A gives the
power to the relay's electromagnet.  When battery A fails, the circuit running throu
gh the relay closes.  Battery B is hooked so that when the relay closes, it fires the
charge.  Experiment with various batteries till you find the best type of battery to
use for the desired delay.
 
File 03:Hourglass Timer
=======================
        What you're gonna have to do is take out all the sand in the hourglass,
replacing it with metal filings.  Now make two small holes into one end of the
hourglass.  Hook one wire from the battery directly to the detonator.  Hook a wire from
the deto
nator to the top hole in the hourglass, and hook the last wire from the battery to the
bottom of the hourglass.  The metal filings flowing into the bottom of the hourglass
will close the electrical circuit and detonate the bomb.
 
File 04:Thermometer Timer
=========================
        Make a small hole in the bulb of the thermometer, inserting the first wire from
the battery directly into the bulb.  Next make a hole into the stem of the thermometer
(Making sure it's above the mercury levelhe second wire directly from the detona
tor to the stem.  Insert the third wire from the battery to the detonator.  When the
thermometer is exposed to heat, the mercury will rise and close the electrical circuit,
detonating the bomb.  Delay time can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the h
eat source and the thermometer's proximity to it.
