Text File 1/?????

                  !!!Our first text file!!!

     The topic of this file is to show how to make a very
strong glue out of milk, vinegar, and baking soda.  Much of
the aparatus used can be substituted with ordinary glassware,
imagination, and/or common sense.

The Apparatus:

     Graduated Cylander         Hot Plate
     Beaker                     Thermometer
     Stirring Rod               Erlenmeyer Flask
     Funnel


The Materials:

     NONFAT Milk                Baking Soda
     Vinegar                    Paper Towel


The Making:

1.)  Pour 125 mL of non-fat milk into a beaker.
2.)  Add 20 mL of vinegar
3.)  Place the mixture on a hot plate or open flame.  Be
     careful to heat the mixture to no more than 60 degrees
     celcius.
4.)  Filter the heated mixture through a piece of paper towel
     into an Erlenmyer flask.  Discard the whey, the shit
     that seeps through the paper towel into the flask.
5.)  Scrape the contents of the paper towel into another
     beaker.  Add a small amount (1 gram) of baking soda to
     the beaker.  Fill with water slowly until the
     consistency of thick glue is obtained.

The Killer Smurfs will not be held responsible for any shit
that hits the fan and scatters all over the joint as a result
of this glue that bonds wood quite well.

The above recipe does work.  We did this in Chemistry class
and it worked quite well.  That is all for now!  See you all
later!

May the knights who until recently said NEET, be with you,
always!
