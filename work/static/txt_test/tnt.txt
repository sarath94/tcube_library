How To Make TNT
---------------

        Probably the most inportant explosive compound in use today is
TNT (trinitrotoluene). This and other types of high explosives are all used by
the military, because of their fantastic power--about 2.25 million pounds per
square inch, and their great stability.TNT also has the great advantage of
being able to be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it can be poured into shells,
mortars, and any other projectiles. Military TNT comes in containers which
resemble dry-cell batteries, and are usually ignited by an electrical charge,
coupled with an electrical blasting cap, although there are different methods.
        Preperation of TNT:
   1. take two beakers. In the first, prepare a solution of 76 percent sulferic
acid (battery acid), 23 percent nitric acid, and 1 percent water. In the other
beaker, prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent
sulferic acid (percentages on a weight ratio rather than volume).
   2. Ten grams of the first solution are poured into an empty beaker and
placed in an ice bath.
   3.  Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.
   4. Remove thebeaker from the ice bath and gently heat it untill it reaches
50 degrees C. The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.
   5. Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added and
the temperature is allowed to rise to 55 degrees C. This temperature is heald
for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will begin to form on the top of
the acid.
   6. After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath,
and cooled to 45 degrees C. When reaching this temperature, the oily liquid
will sink to the bottom of the beaker. At this point, the remaining acid
should be drawn off, by using a syringe.
   7. Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temperature is *slowly* being raised to 83 Degrees C. After this
temperature is reached, it is maintained for a whole half hour.
   8. At the end of this period, the solution should be allowed to cool to 60
degrees C., and is heald at this temperature for another full half hour. After
this, the acid is again drawn off, leaving only the oily liquid at the bottom.
   9. Thirty grams of sulferic acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 degrees C. All temperature increases must be accomplished slowly
and gently.
   10. Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second
solution of acid are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 degrees C to
104 degrees C., and is heald for three hours.
   11. After this three hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C.
and is heald there for a half an hour.
   12. after this half hour, the oil is removed from the acid and washed with
boiling water.
   13. After the washing with boiling water, while being stirred constantly,
the TNT will begin to solidify.
   14. When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker,
so that the TNT will form into pellets.
Once this is done, you have a good quality of TNT.

***NOTE***: the temperatures used in this preperation of TNT are exact, and
must be used as such.Do not estimate or use approximations. Buy a good
centigrade thermometer.
