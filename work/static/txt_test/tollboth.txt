   Ok.  This is one of my first files since my three month 'leave'.  I did
   not invent this, it was invented by greedy, corporate, commuting yuppies
   on their way to work, etc.  
 
   When you come to an entrance to an expressway or turnpike, a machine usually
   gives you a ticket that you give to a person when you get off the turnpike
   at an exit (where they decide how much to charge you).  Now, what you do 
   once you take a ticket is, backup the car back over the sensors in the road,
   thus splurting out another ticket.  What is so great about this?  Well, it
   lets you make longer trips for less money.  On the ticket it says where you
   got on, example: exit 3.  When you take a trip to exit 34 and get off there,
   the toll charge would be about $5.00 or so.  They charge you by the entrance
   you got on at and the exit you got off at (the amount of miles).  So, say
   you live off exit 34, and you go to exit 3 alot.  Well, keep backing up and
   taking tickets at entrance 34 and entrance 3.  IMPORTANT: Always get off 1
   exit before the exit you want to get off at, this is because the ticket
  you took the previous day will say entrance 3 on it, and the dude at the exit
   will get suspicious if you got on at 3 and got right off at 3, and it would
   also be impossible.  Anyway, if you give the guy at exit 4 the entrance 
   ticket from 3 from the day before, he will charge you the amount of money
   from entrance 3 to exit 4, like $.25!  So you could make a trip from 34
   to 3 for 25 cents, not $5.00!  This might seem a little confusing at first,
   so read this again.  The thing that makes this work is that the guy at the
   exit has no idea what ramp you came off of, so he doesn't know where you
   are coming from, he only knows you got on one exit before, even though you
   didn't.  Now it's clear, right?  If not, read it again or give it up.

    And I hate the following crack groups for being such idiotic buttheads:
 
    FIRST CLASS (King of the buttheads), STRATA-CRACKERS, COAST TO COAST,
    DIGITAL GANG, CIRCLE OF DENEB, and basically all egotistical groups that
    think they have to put out a ware before anyone else does and don't give
    a shit about quality, I HATE YOU. (listen to the EXPLOITED song of the
    same title for a more in-depth view).
