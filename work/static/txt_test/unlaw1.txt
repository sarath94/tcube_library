1) Acquire a glass container
2) Put in a few drops of gasoline

5) Add a few drops of Potassium Permanganate (<-get this stuff from a snake
   bite kit)
6) The by throwing aganist a solid object.

          *** It is recommended that this only be done locally ***
 
     To make a conference call with as manypeople you want, just call the
operator ("0") and say "Hello, I'd like to make a conference call."  Then give
the (first) names (not pirate names, either) and thephone #'s of the people you
want to call and she'll do it.  (Hint: make sure that the people you are
calling are expecting it.  Because its damn annoying to be talking to 3 people
and having the third be busy for the whole time.

     On a charge-a-call phone (there blue but don't have any coin slots) take a
hex wrench (with a hole in the middle) and remove the screw in the middle for
an extention!

     From a pay phone, (the kind that gives youa dial tone after you put in the
dime) and drop in your dime.  Then dial the #, then put another dime in!  It'll
come back out when you finish your call.
