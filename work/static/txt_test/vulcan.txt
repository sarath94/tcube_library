  Intro
  =====

           This is the Ultimate Molitov Cocktail. It burns longer
  and hotter than US Army Napalm, and is intended to be used
  only in matters of revenge, self defense, or in the destruction
  of the Federal Government of the United States of America.
  Hail Anarchy, Manson Lives!!

  Requirements:
  --------------

      A)    1-2 gallons of Gasolene of K-1 Kerosene. Gasolene is best!
      B)    Approximately 2 cubic feet of packing styrofoam, the kind
            that comes in the box when you buy computer equipment, etc.
      C)    Approximately 12 oz. of candle wax, that you can get from
            an ordinary candle.
      D)    Fuse. I recommend just going to a hobby shop and buying the
            fuse they sell, it's reliable and burns at a constant
            3 seconds : Inch.
      E)    One large Tupperware-style plastic container to put this stuff
            in.
      F)    A well-ventilated and cool place to build this bomb.

 How To Make It

         The "Vulcan Bomb" is essentially a miniature supernova.  It
   will burn, burn, BURN, **BURN** for about 10 minutes or longer,
   and will generate tremendous amounts of heat and light while doing
   so. Basically, whatever you put on top of this or pour this on
   will be destroyed.

     Take your gasolene/kerosene and pour it into your plastic container.
  I recommend plastic, and not metal. But if you are going to be storing
  this bomb for any length of time, use a metal or plaster container
  because the plastic will begin to dissolve after awhile.

   Now take your styrofoam and grind it up as best you can, using a saw or
  a file. An electric sander would be the best tool to use if you have
  one! Grind it up as finely as you can, and when you're done grinding it
  up, pour the ground styrofoam into the container with the gasolene.
  Stir it for about 2 minutes, and then let it sit. The gas/kerosene
  will react with the materials in the styrofoam, and in about an hour
  or so you'll have a very combustible soup. If the gasolene has begun
  to dry up after the hour, add a few ounces more and stir it as best
  you can.

   Now take your candles and grind them up with a hammer or file. Break
  the wax into small pieces, but they do not have to be as finely ground
  as the styrofoam did before. Just dump the wax on top of your
  mixture, and try to coat it as evenly as possible on the top, since
  eventually this wax will dissolve and help form a top layer over the
  bomb to keep it from breaking down over time.

   Before everything totally solidifies, take your fuse or detonator
  (terrorist's choice!) and insert it several inches deep into the bomb
  so that it won't fall out during combat conditions. If you are using
  fuse, make sure you have enough! Know how long it burns and how long
  you will need!

  Wait another hour or two for everything to completely settle down,
 and now your Vulcan Bomb is all set for the battle ground.

 There are several ways to use this bomb.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Uses
   ====

     #1   Super Nova! Take the entire Bomb and place it underneath/on top
          of or next to whatever you want destroyed. Cars, small houses
          (or even big houses!), government buildings, police headquarters,
          etc., etc., and light the fuse and run! Be sure to hide
          somewhere and laugh while your bomb does what it was designed
          to do...destroy property!! It's best to dump this mixture
          onto the walls of the building if you want to burn a house/
          building down totally. Throw it on the walls like gasolene and
          then light it. Otherwise you'll just have a huge bonfire
          that might not totally burn down the place.

     #2   Selective Anarchy! Take a cup full of the Vulcan Bomb and
          insert the fuse. Use heavy-duty electrical masking tape to
          hold the fuse inside the cup. Find a tight-fitting lid that
          won't fall off when you throw it. Light the fuse, throw it
          as hard as you can, and you've got yourself an inexpensive
          incindiary grenade!

     #3   Fire Perimeter! Take the entire Vulcan Bomb mixture, and pour
          it slowly around the perimeter of your Anarchy Headquarters.
          A full mixture as written above should give you a circle about
          20 yards in diameter. But you may need more. Increase the
          size of the Vulcan Bomb mixture if needed. Anyway, after
          you have surrounded your campsite with the bomb mixture, strike
          a match and light it! This is particularly usefull if the FBI
          pigs are coming in to get you. Just sit tight in the middle of
          your circle and laugh while the Government Pigs burn! It
          might get a little hot, so it might be wise to dig yourself
          a small fox hole before you are forced to do this last-ditch
          defense.


               I hope you enjoyed this little file. Use this bomb!
          Destroy the US Government, once and for all! Then we will
          go out and free our Leader, Charles Manson. Manson
          is God. Hail Anarchy.

     Intro:
     ~~~~~~

            This is a very simple explosive device that does the most
        damage out of any bomb in it's class. It's easy enough to build
        and it's actually practical to make about a dozen of them in
        a few hours, put them in your Anarchy Bag, and go and attack
        the local police station, all in the same night!
    Disclaimer:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

            Unfortunately there are alot of biffwhacked people out there
        who are bound to blow off parts of their anatomy with this
        device, so I'm forced to drop all responsibility for this file
        and this explosive weapon. Pity, I kind of liked this bomb and
        I think it's really cute. Well, I also think Charles Manson is
        cute but anyway...

   ------------------------------------------------------------ ------------

    Materials:
    ~~~~~~~~~~

                  1.   CO2 bottles (for BB guns) that you can buy at
                       any Woolworth or store that sells pellet guns.
                  2.   Fuse. Good old fuse. Don't be cheap, get the
                       good stuff. They sell it at most hobby shops that
                       carry parts for model rockets.
                  3.   Black Powder, aka Gun Powder. This might be
                       difficult for some people, especially those who
                       are deprived and don't have any guns at home.
                       Personally I would die if I didn't have any guns
                       at home but... anyway back to the gunpowder.
                       Use either FFF or FFFF. If you can't get ahold
                       of black powder, you're screwed and can't use this
                       bomb. In the future if I feel like it I'll write
                       a file on how to make black powder. It's real easy
                       but *VERY* dangerous. So if you don't have any
                       black powder sit tight and wait for my next file.
                    - If you have smokeless powder, don't use it. It
                      HAS to be black powder because black powder explodes,
                      which is what you want. Smokeless powder like the
                      kind you use for reloading won't build up enough
                       pressure and your Vulcan Grenade won't do anything.
                  4.   Rubber Cement or model glue. You only need a very
                      small amount. Even Elmer's Glue is good in a pinch.
   ------------------------------------------------------------ -------------
   The Fun Stuff
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                 Take one of your CO2 bottle and empty it out. You can
           pop the cartridge in one of your BB guns and shoot holes in
           the neighbors windows like I used to or you can just take an
           electric drill and drill a hole in the top of the bottle and
           get the CO2 out that way. If you use the drill, be carefull
           because when the CO2 comes out very fast the bottle becomes
           supercooled and you could get frostbite on your hand. Wear
           mittens or better yet a pot holder. You should be in a well
           ventilated area when you do this as well because you'll have
           a cloud of CO2 floating around which isn't poisonous but
           could suffocate you because only plants breate CO2 not people.

             After you have an empty CO2 bottle, take a funnel like you
           would use for changing oil in your car, put the small end on
           the neck of the empty CO2 bottle, and pour as much black
           powder into the bottle are you can fit. Stuff it in there.

             Now take your fuse, which should be slightly smaller in
           diameter than the hole in the neck of the CO2 bottle. Insert
           the fuse into the bottle. If the fuse won't fit, take your
           electric drill and use a larger drill bit and make the hole
           just big enough for the fuse to fit in. Don't worry if it's
           not a perfectly airtight fit, it never is. Make sure the fuse
           goes inside the bottle at least 3/4 an inch, preferrably
           even deeper. It should be in well enough so that you don't
           have to worry about it falling out. If you have to spill out
           a LITTLE bit of black powder, that's okay.

            Now we'll make finish everything up. Take the rubber cement
          or model glue, and put a few drops around the opening of the
          CO2 bottle. Don't use tons and tons of it, just 3 or 4 drops.
          Use enough just to give you a good seal around the edge of the
          fuse where it enters the bottle. It doesn't have to be a super
          tight indestructable seal. Just enough to keep the black powder
          from pouring out while you're carrying it.

            *KNOW HOW MUCH FUSE YOU NEED*. Commercial hobby shop fuse
          burns ABOUT 3 seconds to the inch. Use at LEAST 8 to 10 inches
          of fuse. This bomb is small but it will kill EVERYTHING within
          a radius of about 10 to 15 yards. I buried one in the ground and
          lit it and it blew chunks of mud about 10 feet high and made
          a crater about 4 feet in diameter. This is a shrapnel explosive,
          which means itsey bitsey pieces of steel come flying towards
          you at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour which then bury
          themselves into your flesh and cause great traumatic damage
          leaving you and your friends dead and scattered all over the
          ground. This bomb is very LOUD. We're talking MEGA LOUD.
          Basically you don't want to be within 1/2 mile of this thing when
          it explodes if you're in a quiet neighborhood becase EVERYONE
          within about 1/4 mile or more will hear it go off. This is a
          good bomb to stick inside the muffler of a police car, light the
          fuse and TAKE OFF. The pigs will be delighted to know that
          yet another one of their vehicles has been the target of
          a Vulcan Device.
