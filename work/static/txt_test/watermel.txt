Welcome to the first in an endless series of Bullwinkle Moose creations...
 
The Grain Alcohol Watermelon
--- ----- ------- ----------
Concept:  This creation will allow you to get drunk, without the bad taste of
alcohol, and best of all, you can safely tranport it in a car without worrying
about a cop nailing you for transporting alcohol.
 
Materials Required
--------- --------
1 watermelon (the smaller it is, the less you have to eat)
1 flask of Grain Alcohol (198 proof, or 99% alcohol)
1 small knife
 
Ok, this is really simple.  Get your flask of grain alcohol.  Measure how
wide the mouth of the bottle is.  Then, take the knife, and cut a hole in the
side of the watermelon (make it a bit smaller than the mouth of the bottle to
prevent leakage..also make sure it is pretty much ROUND).  Take the cap off the
flask, and jam it in to the hole in the watermelon.  *NOTE* keep the part of
the watermelon you cut out if you intend to transport the watermelon.
Ok, prop up the watermelon so the bottle is upside down.  Watch for leakage.
Leave it sit for a while, and when the flask is empty, your watermelon is
ready.  If you want to transport the watermelon, put the plug of watermelon
back in the hole.  Then just cut the watermelon up and eat!  You will be drunk
in no time.  Also, if a cop sees it in your car, he will never suspect it.
The alcohol will be absorbed by the watermelon, and then will get you wasted
when you eat it.  **WARNING**  Keep the watermelon away from sparks or flames.
Grain alcohol is very flammable.  I have never tried making a watermelon bomb,
but I'm sure it would at least burn quite a bit.  Also, it is hard to tell how
much alcohol you are 'eating'.  Space apart the peices you eat so you can tell
how wasted you are getting.
